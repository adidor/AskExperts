Well, now we have to focus on what\\xa0 we're doing right, the calories out portion where\\xa0\\xa0 we exert our efforts, because you've probably been\\xa0 told that maybe even all exercise is created equal\\xa0\\xa0 when it's not making the wrong decision here will\\xa0 just leave you skinny and I don't think that's\\xa0\\xa0 what you're looking for. Because when you looked\\xa0 at those pictures in the beginning here, what\\xa0\\xa0 appealed to you is likely the muscular development\\xa0 in the after photo. That's what made it stand out.\\xa0\\xa0 Going for a jog or a run or jumping on a bike\\xa0 is an effective way to burn some additional\\xa0\\xa0 calories and help you to more effectively and\\xa0 easily get into that caloric state. But it's\\xa0\\xa0 not doing anything to create these after photos\\xa0 because these after photos rely on building lean\\xa0\\xa0 muscle tissue. And the only way you're going to\\xa0 do that is by incorporating strength training\\xa0\\xa0 into your regular exercise regimen. I'm talking\\xa0 about hitting the weights on a regular basis as\\xa0\\xa0 part of your overall exercise programing. Look,\\xa0 studies will pit head-to-head diet alone versus\\xa0\\xa0 diet in conjunction with weight training and every\\xa0 single time weight training wins out, especially\\xa0\\xa0 if it's the muscular physique that you're\\xa0 looking to build. Don't overlook this subtle\\xa0\\xa0 difference here and assume that all exercise is\\xa0 created equal because as I said, it's not. And\\xa0\\xa0 making sure you get this right is imperative\\xa0 if you want to look like these guys here.  \\xa0 All right, so in step four, well, what training\\xa0 split are you going to? Because it matters,\\xa0\\xa0 or does it? You see, people get confused often\\xa0 times and confusion leads to no choice at all. I'm\\xa0\\xa0 going to do a total bias split because I was told\\xa0 That's good, or I'm going to do push, pull legs\\xa0\\xa0 or I'm going to do the split. But no, people have\\xa0 said That's bad. So, you know what? I'm going to\\xa0\\xa0 do nothing. Well, you need to do something as we\\xa0 just established. So, what I'm going to tell you\\xa0\\xa0 to do is just make sure you're doing this. Here's\\xa0 the key, progressively overloading, adding more\\xa0\\xa0 weight to the bar to allow your strength to build\\xa0 from work out to work out or phase to phase. Or\\xa0\\xa0 increasing metabolic overload and demands on your\\xa0 body by keeping the rest time shorter and getting\\xa0\\xa0 more work accomplished from workout to workout.\\xa0 Whatever you might do, whatever strategy you pick,\\xa0\\xa0 as long as you're striving to push yourself\\xa0 to a higher level of fitness and strength,\\xa0\\xa0 that's going to do the job.  However, if you're a beginner,\\xa0\\xa0 you're looking for a great three day a week\\xa0 total body plan that's been shown to help\\xa0\\xa0 build muscle effectively, you can follow the one\\xa0 that I put together for you for free right here.\\xa0\\xa0 It's the perfect beginner workout.

Beginners, make sure you check this\\xa0 one out, I promise it will help you out.\", 'It’s always going to make you look better, no matter what level of muscularity you’re at. The key is, you want to make sure that when you’re in the gym you’re commanding the weights that you’re lifting. I’m not saying, ‘don’t lift heavy’. You want to lift as heavy as you possibly can, but not at the pursuit of strength only or not at the expense of bad form. We also know that when we start to go down that avenue, injuries can happen. If you’re obsessed with only the numbers, injury will likely occur. When that happens, that’s the fastest way to find yourself going from in shape to out of shape because one you lose the activity, once you lose the ability to get to the gym regularly, it’s usually the same time you start to say “Oh, it’s doesn’t really matter much what I eat today because I didn’t workout anyway. Who cares?” Then you start to compound that day after day, week after week and you start falling off the tracks, and you never get back on them. So, you want to make sure you’re lifting the weight that you should be lifting, rather than always trying to pursue the weight that you might be able to lift. Last, but no least, the key to all of this – and please don’t understate this one. I’m saving the best for last. Consistency. Consistency is always key. Consistency is what is going to be the thing that unlocks whatever trouble you’re having right now with getting lean. I know what you’re saying. “Jeff, I know. But consistency is the problem.” No, it’s not the problem, guys. The consistency is not the problem. The consistency is trying to be consistent with things you cannot be consistent with. If you’re dieting, you can’t be consistent with that. I’m telling you right now, guys. It’s impossible. The two don’t go hand in hand. Diet is short-term based. It’s got a time lapse on it. Something is going to expire. There’s an expiration on that diet. You cannot remain consistent with that. If you’ve learned how to eat well, if you’ve chosen foods that work for you, if you’ve chosen foods that you like – imagine that concept. You actually like the foods and you’re eating them regularly because you like them and enjoy them. Now we’re talking about consistency. If you find a style of training that you enjoy, if you start to see results from that training; you’re going to stay consistent with it. If you’re not trying to do things in the gym that you shouldn’t be doing because your body is not capable of doing them yet – I’m not saying forever, but maybe ‘yet’ – that’s going to set you up for failure because you could get hurt. Then once again, you’re not going to be consistent.', 'these other options that can tilt the balance a bit more in your favor. But more importantly, prioritize the training in both instances. But guys, just don’t think that you’re going to get away with just doing training, especially cardio, if your goal is to lose body fat. It’s always nutrition. There’s no way around it. There’s not gimmick. There’s no shortcut. There’s nothing. I’ve told you this a million times. I’m going to say it to you again. Make sure you have your nutrition in check and make sure you have a smart training plan in place to allow you to build lean muscle progressively. All right, guys. I hope you’ve found this video helpful. If you’re looking for how you can do this in am ore step by step fashion – from meal plans, step by step meals that are built on the same principles of being something you can do forever, not just a short time. No diets. Something you can do forever. These are all laid out, step by step in our ATHLEANX programs over at ATHLEANX.com.

See you soon.', \"And so now at this point, let's say you followed\\xa0 my advice and you've lost that belly fat by\\xa0\\xa0 focusing on improving your nutrition and becoming\\xa0 aware of everything you put in your body. Well,\\xa0\\xa0 how do you make it permanent? Well, interestingly,\\xa0 it's this decision right here that takes it beyond\\xa0\\xa0 just belly fat and at the same time ensures that\\xa0 you can keep it off for good. Because I believe we\\xa0\\xa0 shouldn't just focus on just our belly. Why not\\xa0 focus on the whole? If you start to include the\\xa0\\xa0 exercise in training in the game plan, you're\\xa0 going to find two things happen. Number one,\\xa0\\xa0 you'll build a much better body because if\\xa0 you just follow a plan that helps you to\\xa0\\xa0 lose weight, you might wind up looking\\xa0 skinny-fat and nobody wants that.  \\xa0 But if you include weight training in the\\xa0 equation, you're now going to start building\\xa0\\xa0 metabolically active tissue that's not only\\xa0 going to make you look better and more muscular,\\xa0\\xa0 but it's actually going to help you to be more\\xa0 forgiving in your long-term approach to nutrition.\\xa0\\xa0 Because all of that additional muscle tissue\\xa0 will actually demand more calories at rest is\\xa0\\xa0 going to help you to burn more calories even when\\xa0 you're doing nothing at all. At the same time,\\xa0\\xa0 including some of that less calorie impactful\\xa0 conditioning is going to do one other gigantic\\xa0\\xa0 thing for you, and that is improve your heart\\xa0 health. Again, you are more than just your\\xa0\\xa0 belly. Start focusing on the big picture.\\xa0 Doing conditioning, doing weight training,\\xa0\\xa0 and of course, caring about your nutrition\\xa0 is going to lead to a much better overall\\xa0\\xa0 result than just having a belly that's flat.  And two final points that I think are going to\\xa0\\xa0 help you immeasurably are two that have helped\\xa0 me a great deal. And that is, first of all,\\xa0\\xa0 throwing out the myth that you can't eat after\\xa0 6:00. Guys, I regularly eat at 10:30, 11:00, even\\xa0\\xa0 11:30 at night. There is no negative side effect\\xa0 of consuming your calories at a later time in the\\xa0\\xa0 day, as some would have you to believe. As long\\xa0 as at the end of the day, the amount of calories\\xa0\\xa0 you consume are less than what it is that you're\\xa0 burning, then you are going to lose fat. So don't\\xa0\\xa0 let that trip you up to the point where you can't\\xa0 establish a meal plan that you can follow.  \\xa0 And the second thing is actually more of\\xa0 a hack. If there's one thing that can help\\xa0\\xa0 you to burn fat faster than anything else, it\\xa0 would be to focus on increasing your protein\\xa0\\xa0 intake. Not only is it more satiating, but it's\\xa0 going to again provide you with the ability to\\xa0\\xa0 more easily build muscle mass, which is more\\xa0 metabolically active and is going to help you\\xa0\\xa0 to burn more calories at rest. For me, I choose\\xa0 a high-quality premium protein Athlean PRO30G,\\xa0\\xa0 you can find it over at Athleanx.com.  If you're looking for a video on how not\\xa0\\xa0 to become skinny-fat guys, you're going to\\xa0 want to watch this one over here. And if\\xa0\\xa0 you haven't done so, click Subscribe and\\xa0 turn on your Notifications so you never\\xa0\\xa0 miss a video when we put one out. All right,\\xa0 guys, see you soon. Watch that video next.\", 'more energy. We all know that your energy can sag if you stay away from water throughout the day as needed. You start to become dehydrated and your performance decreases. Even if it’s only by percentage points, it’s going to have a big impact. Especially when you head to the gym and it’s time to train. Number three, the thing that everyone that’s ripped will do – and this could be a shocker to some – is that they will prioritize when they get to the gym. High intensity, high effort weight training any day over cardio. Again, that’s probably opposite. You probably think “No, I’ve got to get my cardio in.” That’s the number one thing guys think. “I’ve got to get my cardio in if I’m losing weight.” No, you don’t. The most important thing you can do is prioritize your weight training because the more lean muscle you build, the more likely you’re going to be able to stay lean forever. Not just for a short period of time, because we know that muscle tissue is more active. We know by doing weight training we have a much higher likelihood of adding lean muscle to our body, than we do through conditioning and cardio. We know that our insulin sensitivity is higher, meaning we have a different response to the food that we put in our body because we’ve added lean muscle tissue. All of these things will arm us to become much better equipped to handle the lifelong pursuit of being lean. As opposed to burning a few extra calories in a conditioning workout or cardio workout that’s very, very temporary and consolidated to that one effort, or one bout of cardiovascular work. So, the better thing is, if you had to scrap that part of the workout because you’re short on time, you would strength train. You weight train. You try to add more lean muscle to your body. Everyone that’s lean and ripped will tell you that’s what they do every, single time. Guys, I would be ashamed to admit the lack of conditioning that I do in my own workouts. Now, am I conditioned? Can I go out and do a workout that’s conditioning? Of course, I can because I’ve been training athletically my whole life. But I would say, I don’t do enough conditioning. What I do is prioritize my nutrition, I strength train, and I weight train. So, you want to make sure you’re doing the same thing. Next, we talked about, in those weight training sessions; are you lifting the weight that you should be lifting, or are you lifting the weight that you can lift? There are a few things here. Guys, when we talk about lifting the weight that we can lift, we’re talking more about pure strength training. The thing about pursuing pure strength training is, a lot of times, that little bit of extra weight is something that will work to your advantage. It could create additional leverage, allow you to move more pounds. That’s a good thing if that’s what your pursuit is. However, if your goal is to be as lean and ripped as possible, I’ve also talked about – even in my most recent video about my body stats – that being lean is always going to make you look more muscular.', \"I'm talking about more of your burst training, your HIIT training, where you're trying to burn calories at a maximum, in a shorter period of time. You should constantly be trying to vary the exercises that you do. So for here, fat loss; always increase variety of your exercises. So guys, as you can see here, again, there's a lot of parameters, and it all depends on what you're trying to train for. It also depends on where you are in the training stage. If you're a beginner, or if you're more advanced there's things that you want to do. There are always variables that you want to change. But the fact is this: remember, your bodies are pretty damned smart. They know how to adapt, and they're always looking to get you to stay the same. You have to be smarter than it, and you have to force change at every opportunity, knowing exactly the right type of change to make at the right time. Guys, if you're looking for a program that lays it out, and helps you find where you're at in that training cycle – whether it's beginner, or advanced, and knows whatever it is you're trying to accomplish – I can help you meet those goals, and get there a lot faster. If you click on the link below this video our program selector tool will do just that. It will help you shortcut your process to get you to the point where the training plan sets in, and allows you to make your progress as you go along. That's over at ATHLEANX.com. In the meantime, if you've found this video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below. If you have any other suggestions that were better than Jessie's, as to what I should do on the intro, save them. I don’t want to hear them! I’m not changing my intro! All right, guys. I'll see you back here again soon.\", 'I can actually do. So there are some things you can’t do. You can’t train explosively. So, you don’t need to train explosively. At least not now. There are some things you can’t necessarily load up heavy, heavy weights. But you can do bodyweight training. And it could actually serve as a foundation for building a good physique. We know you can build muscle with bodyweight. There’s always a place you can start, but if you’re not mentally ready for it then you’re not going to get there. Guys, do me a favor. Find the real reason why it is that you know you need to change. Because you haven’t done it yet if you’re on the sidelines and you haven’t started yet. I know you want to, but you haven’t figured out the real reason. For those that do train, don’t ignore this video either. Find that real reason why you train. It will probably be very easily identifiable for you because you’ve already figured it out and it drives you every, single day. You get your ass out of bed, you get yourself to the gym, you train late at night, you train early in the morning, and you do it for a reason. Whatever that reason is, that’s what drives you, and that’s what will continue to keep you working out, and training long into your life because you know exactly what it is that’s moving you in that direction. All right, guys. I hope you’ve found a little bit of this revealing behind the scenes with Jesse to be helpful. I’m not every trying to embarrass Jesse. He’s a great kid. It will click for him one day. It’s going to click for him and he’s going to wind up starting his training and there will be nobody to stop him. Especially if knows he’s got me here to be able to guide him along that way when he’s ready to allow me to. Guys, I’ll be back here again in just a couple days with another new video. Meanwhile, let me know if you want to see more behind the scenes if you want me to open the kimono for you I’m glad to do that more often here, on this channel. All right, guys. I’ll be back here again real soon. JESSE: All right. I’m going to go do a couple curls. JEFF: Yeah, now you see? This is bullshit, actually, by the way. See you.', \"that beginner you try that intermediate version of the exercise first. You do as much as you can of that, and then you drop down when you can't do anymore. If you're in the intermediate category you need to advance yourself to that next level. You do that exercise version for as long as you can until you can't do it anymore, and then you step down. And if you're advanced, you want to be a real bad ass, you do the two minutes straight of the advanced version without ever dropping down. The fact of the matter is, I'm going to get you to work, and we're going to get you to lose fat a lot faster because we are going to get more work done. Matter of fact, if you want to start accumulating more seconds of effort in your training, and seconds of high effort – which is both key for fat loss – you should check out our Max Shred program. We actually built in levels – we call them fire escapes – as you drop down from one level to the next. You change the exercises up and ensure that you keep moving and burning calories faster than any other workout. Head to ATHLEANX.com and get our brand new Max Shred program. We also have our Max Science program that we released as well, with the opposite goal of prioritizing muscle gain. That is over there as well. The fact is, we're putting the science back in strength in everything we do, and you should do that too, if you want to see better results. You can get them both over at ATHLEANX.com right now. In the meantime, if you did this workout, leave your comments and thumbs up below and let me know. Are you joining me on the ground in the fetal position? I really hope you do, okay? Because I feel silly being down there alone by myself.\", \"and the thing that keeps you in the gym.  Because ultimately, if that injury becomes\\xa0\\xa0 so inflamed that you can no longer\\xa0 do your work as then you're accruing\\xa0\\xa0 zero volume and making zero gains. So, this is a\\xa0 case where actually doing less equals more in the\\xa0\\xa0 long run and it's actually related to my next\\xa0 question, which is a very important one.  \\xa0 And that is, are you actually recovered from\\xa0 your training? Because whether or not you're\\xa0\\xa0 training for a bigger chest or a stronger\\xa0 chest or really any muscle, for that matter,\\xa0\\xa0 you're only as good as your body's ability to\\xa0 recover from the last workout and be prepared\\xa0\\xa0 for the next workout. And when I m talking about\\xa0 next, I'm not just talking about the next workout,\\xa0\\xa0 I'm talking about every next workout. Because your\\xa0 goal should always be improvement in some way,\\xa0\\xa0 shape or form. If you're training for strength,\\xa0 are you able to continue to add weight to the bar\\xa0\\xa0 or has the last session left you in a place where\\xa0 you actually can't do that anymore? Because if it\\xa0\\xa0 has, you need to revisit the volume that you're\\xa0 performing right now and make decreases to that.\\xa0\\xa0 From a hypertrophy standpoint, if the next workout\\xa0 is actually impaired by the soreness that you\\xa0\\xa0 created in this workout, then you need to not only\\xa0 consider the volumes that you're doing right now,\\xa0\\xa0 but also the techniques you're using, which\\xa0 actually brings me to my last question.  \\xa0 And that is, what exercises are you actually\\xa0 performing and how are you performing them?\\xa0\\xa0 Because all that matters as well. You see,\\xa0 if your chest workout consists of bench\\xa0\\xa0 press and let's say heavy weight, it dips versus\\xa0 crossovers and bench flies don't do bench flies,\\xa0\\xa0 by the way the requirements for getting the job\\xa0 done are going to vary dramatically. And that's\\xa0\\xa0 because those single joint exercises are going to\\xa0 oftentimes be performed with much lighter weights,\\xa0\\xa0 which you're going to require additional volume to\\xa0 get that stress required to produce muscle growth.\\xa0\\xa0 At the same point, those compound exercises that\\xa0 are much more taxing and demanding on the body\\xa0\\xa0 that lend themselves to more progressive overload\\xa0 and strength are going to ultimately bring that\\xa0\\xa0 set count down because you're able to induce more\\xa0 results at a quicker, faster pace. Not to mention,\\xa0\\xa0 as I said, the way you perform these sets would\\xa0 matter as well for the reasons we just talked\\xa0\\xa0 about before. If you're using eccentric muscle\\xa0 overload, because let's say you've tapped out\\xa0\\xa0 all of your available strength gains at the moment\\xa0 on an exercise, we know we can induce more muscle\\xa0\\xa0 growth, but at what cost? We'd have to make\\xa0 sure that we're allowing for more recovery from\\xa0\\xa0 those additional stresses, from eccentric muscle\\xa0 damage to make sure we keep those gains coming. \\xa0 And all of this now comes around to\\xa0 formulate one final question that\\xa0\\xa0 you probably should be asking me right now.\\xa0 And I know you're probably thinking, Jeff,\\xa0\\xa0 if I know how many steps I'm supposed to do in\\xa0 a week, how can I ultimately split that up n the\\xa0\\xa0 case of the chest to make sure I get the job done\\xa0 the right way? I m happy to answer it for you. \\xa0 So now considering everything we've learned in\\xa0 the fact that the general consensus within this\\xa0\\xa0 broad range of eight to 32 says with the available\\xa0 science we have is that somewhere between 15 and\\xa0\\xa0 18 sets is sort of the safe place to start. We\\xa0 want to make those changes either up or down based\\xa0\\xa0 on the answer to your questions. And when we take\\xa0 an example like the chest, we're going to say,\\xa0\\xa0 how do they now fit into an overall training week\\xa0 based on some different types of splits you might\\xa0\\xa0 be following? So, if we took basically a push pull\\xa0 leg split we would have, let's say, our push day\\xa0\\xa0 falling on the second day of the cycle, so pull,\\xa0 push and legs with off day coming back, pull,\\xa0\\xa0 push and legs. So, on the first push day, you\\xa0 hit your big exercise like your bench press,\\xa0\\xa0 and you do it for three to five sets.\\xa0 You come up with a secondary chest\\xa0\\xa0 exercise and that would be for three sets. When you come back here the second time, we have\\xa0\\xa0 three exercises we could put in here. Because we\\xa0 could basically say, hey, let's change the focus\\xa0\\xa0 of our big strength exercise to an overhead\\xa0 press and then just come in and fill in the gaps\\xa0\\xa0 with some secondary chest exercises. Three\\xa0 of them for three sets apiece. Again,\\xa0\\xa0 that puts you at nine sets and eight sets,\\xa0 around 17 sets for that type of split.  \\xa0 Now, if you follow a total body split, now we have\\xa0 set where we set up a Monday, Wednesday and Friday\\xa0\\xa0 workout schedule.

However, it is mentioned that prioritizing weight training over cardio is important for losing body fat and building lean muscle. It is also mentioned that weight training should be prioritized for its ability to increase lean muscle mass and improve insulin sensitivity. Therefore, it is recommended to prioritize weight training and incorporate cardio, such as running, as a secondary form of exercise. It is important to consult with a fitness professional or trainer to determine the best approach for your specific goals and fitness level.\\n\\nCited videos:\\n1. \\\"5 Things EVERY Ripped Guy Does (COPY THESE!)\\\" - Start time: 00:06:57\\n2. \\\"When to Change Your Workout (DON\\u2019T MESS THIS UP!)\\\" - Start time: 00:07:57\\n3. \\\"The REAL Reason You Work Out (OR DON\\u2019T!)\\\" - Start time: 00:07:42\\n4. \\\"6 Minute Fat Loss Workout (BEGINNER | INT | ADVANCED)\\\" - Start time: 00:04:24\\n5. \\\"\\u201cHow Many Sets Per Week for a BIG Chest\\u201d (SCIENCE SAYS!)\\\" - Start time: 00:07:23\\n6. \\\"He Tried Mike Tyson\\u2019s Total Body Workout (4,500 REPS!!)\\\" - Start time: 00:07:00\\n\\nThese videos provide information on weight training, building lean muscle, and the importance of prioritizing weight training over cardio.\"\n",
