        "text": "What is the Stock Exchange  and how does it work? The Stock Exchange is nothing more  than a giant globally network tend to organize the market place where every day  huge sums of money are moved back and forth. In total over sixty trillion (60,000,000,000,000)  Euros a year are traded. More than the value of all goods and services  of the entire world economy. However it's not apples or second hand  toothbrushes that are traded on this marketplace. But predominantly securities. Securities are rights to assets,  mostly in the form of shares. A share stands for  a share in a company. But why are shares traded at all? Well, first and foremost the value of a share  relates to the company behind it. If you think the value of  a company in terms of a pizza. The bigger the overal size of the pizza,  the bigger every piece is. If for example Facebook is able to greatly  increase its profits with a new buisness model. The size of the companies pizza will also increase,  and as a result so will the value of its shares. This is of course great for the share holders. A share which perhaps used to be worth 38 euros  could now be worth a whole 50 euros. When it's sold this represents  a profit of twelve euro per share! But what does Facebook gain from this? The company can raise funds by selling  the shares and invest or expand it's buisness. Facebook, for example, has earned sixteen billion  dollars from it's listing on the Stock Exchange. The trading of shares though,  is frequently a game of chance. No one can say which company  will preform well and which will not. If a company has a good reputation,  investors will back it. A company with a poor reputation or poor  performance will have difficulty selling its shares. Unlike a normal market in which goods  can be touched and taken home on the Stock Exchange only  virtual goods are available. They apear in the form of share prices  and tables on monitors. Such shareprices can rise  or fall within seconds. Shareholders therefore have to act quickly  in order not to miss an opportunity. Even a simple rumor can result in the demand for  a share falling fast regardless of the real value of the company. Of course the opposite is also possible. If a particularly large number of people buy weak shares. Because if they see for example  great potential behind an idea. Their value will rise as a result. In particular young companies  can benefit from this. Even though their sales might be falling,  they can generate cash by placing their shares. In the best case scenario this will result in  their idea being turned into reality. In the worst case scenario, this will result in a  speculative bubble with nothing more than hot air. And as the case with bubbles,  at some point, they will burst. The value of Germany's biggest thirty companies  is summarized in what is known as the DAX share index. The DAX shows how well or poorly  these major companies and there by the economy as a whole  are performing at the present time. Stock Exchange is in other countries  also have there own indices. And all of these markets together  create a globally networked marketplace. Subtitles by the Amara.org community",
