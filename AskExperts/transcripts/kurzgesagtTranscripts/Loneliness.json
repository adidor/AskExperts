But over the last few decad es, this occasional feeling has become chronic for millions. In the UK, 60% of 18 to 34 year old say they often feel lonely. In the US, 46% of the entire population feel lonely regularly. We are living in the most connected time in human history, and yet, an unprecedented number of us feel isolated. Being lonely and being alone are not the same thing. You can be filled by bliss by yourself, and hate every second surrounded by friends. Loneliness is a purely subjective, individual experience. If you feel lonely, you are lonely. A common stereotype is that loneliness only happens to people who don't know how to talk to people, or how to behave around others. But population-based studies have shown that social skills make practically no difference for adults when it comes to social connections. Loneliness can affect everybody. Money, fame, power, beauty, social skills, a great personalityâ€” nothing can protect you against loneliness, because it's part of your biology. Loneliness is a bodily function, like hunger. Hunger make you pay attention to your physical needs; loneliness makes you pay attention to your social needs. Your body cares about your social needs, because millions of years ago, it was a great indicator of how likely you were to survive. Natural selection rewarded our ancestors for collaboration, and for forming connections with each other. Our brains grew and became more and more fine-tuned to recognize what others thought and felt, and to form and sustain social bonds. Being social became part of our biology You were born into groups of 50 to 150 people, which you usually stayed with for the rest of your life. Getting enough calories, staying safe and warm, or caring for offspring was practically impossible alone. Being together meant survival, being alone meant death. So it was crucial that you got along with others. For you ancestors, the most dangerous threat to survival was not being eaten by a lion, but not getting the social vibe of your group and being excluded. To avoid that, your body came up with \"social pain\". Pain of this kind is is an evolutionary adaptation to rejection. A sort of early warning system to make sure you stop behaviour that would isolate you. Your ancestors who experienced rejection as more painful",

That's why rejections hurt, and even more so, why loneliness is so painful. These mechanisms for keeping us connected worked great for most of our history, until humans began building a new world for themselves The loneliness epidemic we see today really only started in the late Renaissance. Western culture began to focus on the individual. Intellectuals moved away from the collectivism of the Middle Ages, while the young Protestant theology stressed individual responsibility. This trend accelerated during the Industrial Revolution. People left their villages and fields to enter factories. Communities that had existed for hundreds of years began to dissolve, while cities grew. As our world rapidly became modern, this trend sped up more and more. Today, we move vast distances for new jobs, love, and education, and leave our social net behind. We meet fewer people in person, and we meet them less often than in the past. In the US, the mean number of close friends dropped from 3 in 1985 to 2 in 2011. Most people stumble into chronic loneliness by accident. You reach adulthood and become busy with work, university, romance, kids, and Netflix. There's just not enough time. The most convenient and easy thing to sacrifice is time with friends. Until you wake up one day and you realise that you feel isolated, that you yearn for close relationships. But it's hard to find close relationships as adults, and so, loneliness can become chronic. While humans feel pretty great about things like iPhones and spaceships, our bodies and minds are fundamentally the same they were 50,000 years ago We are still biologically fine-tuned to being with each other. large scale studies have shown that the stress that comes from chronic loneliness is among the most unhealthy things we can experience as humans it makes you age quicker it makes cancer deadlier Alzheimer's advance faster your immune systems weaker loneliness is twice as deadly as obesity and as deadly as smoking a pack of ciggarettes a day the most dangerous thing about it is that once it becomes chronic it can become self sustaining physical and social pain use",

Cacloppo & William Patrick it's an entertaining and scientific exploration as to why we experience loneliness on a biological level how it's spread in society and what science has to say on how to escape it links for both books in the video description",
