        "text": "do we need nuclear energy to stop climate change more and more voices from science environmental activists and the press have been saying so in recent years but this comes as a shock to those who are fighting against nuclear energy and the problems that come with it so who's right well it's complicated to slow rapid climate change the world needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero in 2018 three quarters of global emissions were released through energy production namely by burning fossil fuels energy is a broad term that describes all sorts of stuff from moving things and people around to putting things big and small together or heating our homes currently 84 percent of the world's primary energy comes from fossil fuels 33 from oil 27 from coal and 24 from gas around 10 of the global oil supply is just used to burn in boilers to make our homes cozy and warm only about 16 of global energy is from low emission sources almost 7 from hydroelectric 5 from solar wind bio energy wave tidal and geothermal combined and about four percent from nuclear so we pretty much rely on coal oil and gas to keep our civilization going which means it's actually very hard to transition away from them to have a chance of escaping fossil fuels without throwing humanity back into the stone age one of the most impactful things we can do is to electrify as many sectors as possible electricity is the stuff that appears like magic when you plug something into a socket so you can watch youtube every industry that can switch from burning fossil fuels to electricity needs to do so from electric cars to",
