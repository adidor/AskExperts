        "text": "for one little modification as I reach across my body to create some rotation I lift the opposite leg just a little bit mostly to clear the rotation otherwise to allow the rotation to happen a little bit more easily but again another great top down movement where you alternate both sides for the duration of however long you're doing exercise most of the time 45 to 60 seconds for the advanced viewers we have a crunch pull down variation and what I like about this is it can become very Advanced because you can continue to put the weight up the stack as heavy as you can handle but what you have to do is make sure you do it right because so many people screw this up they take it and they make it so damn easy that it gives you no real effect if you want to do this right you have to initiate every single repetition right from this upper roll of the abdominals in other words try to fold your chest onto that top row of the abdominals try to create a crease right under your chest line if you can visualize that and then you can do this right because what people oftentimes do is they either sit back onto their heels literally moving their butt back towards their heels which is a giant mistake because you're just letting your hip flexors do the activity or they'll try to hold down by pulling too hard on the arms I want you to Envision having the arms hooked right next to your ears and not moving at any point and only initiating the rep from that movement of the chest the lower chest line right towards that top row of the ABS see if you can make them touch it's a biological impossibility but it's still a good visualization to have if you could perform this exercise correctly guys you can load it up like I said as heavy as you want and make a great Advanced version of a top-down exercise if you do these two movement patterns you have a lot of options when it comes to top down and bottom-up rotation if",
