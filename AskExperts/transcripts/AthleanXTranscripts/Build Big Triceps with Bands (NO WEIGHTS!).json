        "text": "so the first exercise is you want to build bigger triceps with bands is abandoned dip but no you don't need one of these because if you have access to one of those you're probably already in a gym you're really not looking for painted exercises but I can show you a different way to do it so you can hook this band around your neck and then push down and keeping your elbows tight to your side and your elbows back behind the body this will give you a good activation of all three heads of the triceps and again you can vary the resistance you have here based on the thickness of the band that you're using now by all means if you have access to this or just want to do it even a kitchen counter corner you still do the same thing you hook that band around your back under your hands and start repping out so next up in sticking with the theme of minimalism that I think bans demand we're going to talk about something called the JM press here and all you got to do is wrap the band around your back like this and then just allow your elbows to fold back so that your forearms are going back towards your biceps and what this does is it obviously causes the same type of extension that we get in a typical barbell Jam press and limits a lot of distance to that upper portion of the press which is really where the triceps do most of the work anyway this is particularly helpful for building up the lateral and medial heads of the tricep and again requires nothing more than the floor you're laying on so next is the first of two different push-up variations and we know that push-ups will build the triceps particularly if we take our hands from a wider position and we start to narrow them up and maybe so narrow as we get to that Diamond Cutter position that we talk about and all you got to do is take this band and wrap it around your back and now when we get into that close grip position we're",

        "text": "going to have resistance right here at the top of every rep and again we know that the triceps are most contributory right here at the top of every rep so if we can overload them with additional resistance then we're on our way to building bigger triceps and remember guys muscles don't necessarily know the difference between barbells dumbbells and bands as long as the resistance is there well now we're talking and so the fourth exercise up here is actually a reenactment or a replication and one of my favorite tricep exercises and that's the tricep extension what we got here is is the need for one little Anchor Point here for the band that you wrap around and pull through and now when I get down here I'm looking to get that good stretch on the triceps to start come up extend and hold and what you might realize is that there's actually more tension at the end of this exercise than there normally would be if your arms were positioned up here over your body like we talked about with the regular line tricep extension but here because the maximum resistance here is on the triceps in this P contracted position we're getting a really good overload in the replicating what's already a great exercise and making it adaptable for bands only and so if you're training in a limited equipment environment and you find these band videos helpful make sure you watch the playlist I put together for you at the end of this video And subscribe and also if you're looking for a 90 day complete band Only program we have one called athlete elastics it's over at fns.com now back to the video and so exercise number five is actually the Beloved Kickback or maybe people hate the kickback but with a bandit actually allows you to do some things that you can't necessarily do with just dumbbells and that is start the resistance a little earlier and the beauty about this is that again I'm getting resistance against the triceps",

        "text": "from this position here where I normally wouldn't have it in a traditional dumbbell weighted variation of this and when I get to the top I still have good resistance against the triceps in that P contracted State making it a good option when you're trying to overload the long hand of the triceps in its fully shortened state but of course if you want to get that full engage around the triceps you don't just want to get that long head targeted in its contracted position we also want to put it on stretch and one of the best ways to do that is with the overhead extension and the band allows us to do some cool things and what I want you to do is just kind of back into the band right lay it on the floor and then step back into it key is you want to get the elbows slightly pointed out in front of you that all the way to the side like this I can stress your shoulder you get them out this way and then we just start to extend the hands and again this is actually nice because on a traditional dumbbell when we get towards the top we're actually losing some of the resistance against the triceps whereas the band because the band is getting more and more and more stretched and there's more more attention to get to the very top position here we actually have to exert more Force so the band acts in a complementary way to accentuate an exercise that's already effective making it worth your while and that brings us to our push down variations just because you don't have access to a cable machine doesn't mean you can't do them you just flip them over the top of a pull-up bar like that pull one side in and you're ready to go and what you do is you wrap one hand in and grab the band the other hand and grab the band and now you got a cable push down but what I want you to do is do a wood Chopper push down and that is you come down towards one side and the benefit of being able to do this is that",

        "text": "you're getting more total body power to be able to use a really heavily resisted band here but more importantly I can get that one arm a little further back behind my body and we already know that the further the arm goes behind the body into extension then the more that long head we're also incorporating with the medial and the lateral head so if I can go back and forth here and use a little bit more of this total body English I can get a heavier band to be able to be used here and replicate more effectively what I would normally be using on a typically heavily weighted tricep push down for the next exercise you need to find a middle Anchor Point right something about shoulder height you simply wrap your band inside and we're going to perform a push away variation a lot of times people perform their push waves this way but they lose a lot of the tension on the triceps instead you want to be very upright and then you're going to extend your arms straight up overhead and because that band is more perpendicular to those forearms at the top we know we have good tension on the triceps but we can take it a step further with a plus and what the plus is is by having that back foot behind me I can step through the end while holding in this isometric position so here and then back and extend down come up take a plus step to resist that further come down and reset up plus through and back down so the band here is almost self-correcting allowing you to push away the way you're supposed to in the first place and give you some of that added tension because of the plus and when you at least wanted it but the most benefit from it now if you want to Encompass more and make it more overall conditioning based you just change your Anchor Point to a low one feed it through your band and now we've got a twisting lunge and push away so we can actually fit this nicely into a conditioning circuit and still work our",
