I'm just reacting to his 10. what else are you at next um so I got two left yeah probably like a hanging leg raise just to make sure your core is getting hit you're nothing that's that's [ __ ] up your back and then that's you love the hanging leg raise well I actually think people need to train their core directly I don't believe that just training with exercises like the barbell bent over row",

I think it's the last one okay what do we got and then foreign overhead tricep extension because I haven't had a lot of things so he just went see he took a leftovers over [ __ ] yeah you've got the close grip and you've got the uh incline press yeah so I already did my tricep extension on the bench um I I I definitely think that the pressing is definitely great when you're doing the dumbbell shoulder pressing but there's no doubt that if you want to get bigger middle delts which is significantly going to contribute to the look or the overall growth of your shoulders yeah you have to pick some variation of lateral phrases um I might pick to be totally honest I might pick the cheat lateral version of it I know you like the cheat lateral",
