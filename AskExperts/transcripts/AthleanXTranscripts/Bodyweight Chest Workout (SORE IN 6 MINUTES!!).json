        "text": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. The Sore in Six: Bodyweight series continues, and this time we're hitting the chest. We're going to get some soreness going on because we're going to get a great, metabolic overload going here. If you watched my video on this before I told you, metabolically, if we can overload ourselves we can actually build muscle that way. It's one of the three main ways that we build muscle. So here's what we're using. We're using this, and this. I'm not going to call it a bench. I'm not going to call it a dip station because you don’t need this, or this. I could use the back of a couch, as you see me doing here. Or if I don’t have access to a dip station I could certainly use a countertop, like you see me doing here. We're going to do use mechanical drop sets to get us through this because we need to get six minutes of action going here. The exercises are going to be a pushup, but we're going to have three different versions of it. We're going to have a decline pushup, we're going to have a flat pushup, and we're going to have an incline pushup. We know that the decline pushup is the most difficult version. We know that when we go down we're working more of our upper chest here, which is generally weaker than the rest of our chest. And then we know when we go flat we transition that a little bit more to the mid-chest, which is slightly stronger. And then we know if we turn around and use this surface again this way, we can get this incline pushup, which works more of the lower chest. Again, we are a little bit stronger here. So as fatigue sets in we can continue to go through it. You're going to do a minute starting in the hardest position, when we're our freshest. We're going to start with the decline pushup. Now the great thing is, this workout is going to be segmented based upon your ability levels. So beginners, intermediate, and advanced. So if I'm going decline, in the first minute we're going to get through the entire one minute of this. The beginners can do it from their knees, like this. We'll make it a little easier for them to try to rep out for the full minute. The intermediate people are going to go from their toes, here, with that decline pushup. Advanced guys are going to go with the twisting pushup. You come down, you push up, and through the fingers there. So we're turning, and twisting right here, in the middle of the chest. Come down, and go to the other side. Here, twist. That's minute one in the decline position. If you're in an advanced position – doing the twisting pushups in the decline – if, for some reason, you can't get all the way through the minute, you drop down to the flat position here. Still do the same exercise, but it will be from there. If you have to drop again, for whatever reason, you can go to the incline position, and you",

        "text": "can twist here. Same thing goes for the beginners. The beginners start on their knees. If, for some reason, they tire out here, they can drop down, and go to their knees here, and finish out their one minute knee pushup. Now, in the second minute you come right over here to the dip section. Stay in the contracted range of motion, right up here, at the top. Just a little dip, and up. Remember, we want to keep all the metabolites that are accumulating from what we just did, keep them there, and then one eccentric rep, all the way down. Step up if you have to, or jump back up. One, two, three, and down. Beginners, do this for 20 seconds. Intermediates, do this for 30 seconds. Advanced guys do it for 40 seconds. Now, minute three I come back down. If we're intermediates we're on our feet here, flat on the floor, and we're doing flats. If we're advanced we're coming up, and we're doing twisting from the flat position, and if we're beginner we're down on the knees and we're doing flats from here. Remember, if we have to drop here because we don’t get our reps, you go to the incline, and you rep out. The goal is to continue to make sure that you rep all the way through that full minute. Minute four, you're back up there. You do the same thing. 20, 30, or 40 seconds based upon beginner, intermediate, or advanced. Then finally, we come back here, we work on the incline position. So again, the advanced guys are up here for a minute straight, doing the twisting pushup. The intermediate guys are doing the regular, flat pushup, no twist. And then the beginners are down, on their knees, and they're working through here. Guys, it ain't easy, but it works. Again, getting yourself to work for six straight minutes is something you're probably not used to, but that's where the benefits lie. Push yourself here. I know you can do it. I'm going to take you down through the advanced version, but you pick the one that's your level, and you push as hard as you can, and get through it. So there you have it, guys.
