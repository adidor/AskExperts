A lot of people think that you cannot get big arms by using bodyweight, but that is a myth. I'm going to show you today with just four exercises and one pullup bar how to start building bigger triceps and biceps, starting right now. So there you have it, guys. Two exercises for each muscle group, kill switch style, bodyweight only, and one pullup bar, no excuses. If you're looking for a complete training program that doesn't even use a damn bar, ATHLEAN0, over at ATHLEANX.com! No bars, no bands, no bench, no bull. You guys can get that over there. A six week training program. In the meantime, if you've found this video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below. Tell me what else you want to see on our bodyweight Wednesday videos and I will do my best to cover them. All right, guys. We'll be back here again real soon!",
