        "text": "I used to work out a lot with weights and the  check comes doing your joints start to hurt this,   back, knees, it just happens. Sometimes  getting into that kind of shape can kill you.   There's fantastic trainers like Jeff Cavaliere on  Athlete-X, his videos are amazing. But at my age,   I found the hardest, toughest, most productive  way is bands, training with bands.   Yeah, bands are great and all and this  Jeff Cavaliere fellow, he's a great guy,   but what about Jesse Laico at Atheleanx.com,  he's the real star of the show.    I can't disagree with the thing you just said.   What's up guy's Jeff Cavaliere, Atheleanx.com. You  see, I've always been a Stallone guy and Arnold,   you just gave me more validation as to why. But  the fact is, we're talking about bands today,   guys that's we can all agree on and you can  actually build muscle using just bands. I'm   continuing the series and today we're talking  all about shoulders. What can you do to hit   the middle, front and rear delt, as a matter  of fact, you hit the whole shoulder together?   These are the exercises that you want to focus  on. Let's start break them down one by one.    So, when it comes to building bigger shoulders,  we're going to start here with the big exercises.   You know, the ones that hit all three heads  at once. And you can't start without talking   about the overhead press. You see, there's a  challenge, though, when it comes to overhead   pressing with bands. Usually, you're either using  something that provides good amount of tension,   but you just can't stretch it far enough  when it comes all the way from the ground,   or you opt for something lighter and it just  doesn't provide enough overload to cause growth.   So instead, you do this, and this is the line  one arm press. And what this does is it fixes   the band length problem because I can start with  a bent leg and I can match my strength levels to   provide just the amount of tension that's going  to create the overload necessary for growth.   Of course, as I get stronger, I can  creep my foot down further and further,   increasing the length of travel and stretch  of the band. I could also do something really   unique here, I don't have to just settle for  the concentric overload. I could actually   introduce an eccentric overload as well. Once  the band is fully extended up over my head,   I push my foot down and try to control the descent  of the hand back down to shoulder level.    Now, let's say I want to do something different. I  don't want to go for a tension overload, I want to   introduce a metabolic overload to my pressing.  Well, I could do this, this is the push press   pull apart. And here I could actually focus  a little bit more on increasing the time that   I'm under tension at the top of the press.  So when I press up overhead with two hands,   now I actually get a chance to stay there, pull  the band apart at the top, and then, of course,   pull it back together, creating an abduction  resistance that's making it harder for me to   actually get my arms fully extended and my  hands close together up over my head.    When you're looking to get a little bit  more explosive with the overhead pressing,   the kneeling up and over's is the way to go  and see. What you do is you anchor the band   underneath your knees and then you put your hands  in this pressure position so the band is not   bending your wrist back and you get to this  tall, kneeling position and you simply drive   this band up overhead as fast and hard as you  possibly can. Speed matters here. We're looking   for power. We want to introduce a different  stimulus here for those delts. This is going   to definitely hit the front and middle delt, the  rear delt not as much, but don't worry guys we're   going to be hitting those in just a minute.  And with our three overall shoulder exercises   down, now it's time to start working around from  head to head to head. And we're going to start   right here in the front with the front raise  pull apart. You see, this is looking like a   traditional front dumbbell raise, except we're  doing it with bands. But when we get to the top,   we could do something to introduce some new  stresses here and prolong the time that we   have to spend in this miserable top position  on the front delt raise. And this is where we   just simply pull the bands apart. And by doing  that, yeah, we're going to shift a little bit   that load to the middle and rear delt, but most  importantly, what we're doing is prolonging the   time under tension that we have at that top,  most difficult position of the front raise.",

        "text": "If you really want to put a unique stress on the  front delts, then you're going to want to do this.   And this is the stretch front raise. The band  should be anchored behind you in such a way that   it actually pulls your arm back into extension,  which is going to apply a good stretch on the belt   before every single repetition is performed. It's  the act of this stretching of the front delt that   gives you the stretch reflex necessary to create  a more powerful contraction. So, what I like to   do is not just drive my arm up in front of me, but  then control the descent in the eccentric all the   way back down. You can literally see the fibers  resisting this on every single repetition.    Working our way around now to the middle delt. You  know, you're going to have to do some side lateral   raises here. And you can actually do these better  than maybe you can with some dumbbells if you know   how to apply tension the right way. What I like  to do, number one is not anchor the band under   the same side foot that I'm lifting my arm up on,  but on the opposite side. Because what it does   is it gives me a little bit more range of motion  in which I can actually apply the resistance of   the band. And then I also want to make sure that  I grab this thing the right way, because whether I   grab a dumbbell or I grab a band with an overhang  grip, I'm actually going to be at the mercy of any   kind of weakness I might have my wrist or any pain  I might have my forearm in terms of performing   this with peak tension at the top of the rep.  What I could do instead with the band is simply   grab it this way, anchor it around the back  of my hand and then just focus on lifting up   the entire arm. It's not so much focused on  what's happening directly at the wrist. Now,   let's say you have some of those issues at  your wrist or forearm and you still want to   take advantage of the gains you can have by doing  these lateral raises, you can do the short arc   version of this. And that's when you take a band  of much heavier resistance anchor it around your   arms like you see me doing here, double up around  the elbows and then you simply drive your elbows   out away from your body into abduction at the  shoulder as much as you possibly can. The fact is,   with the arm decreased from the long arc version  here, you're going to have to introduce a heavier   band in order to have the resistance that you're  looking for, to create the muscle overload.   And now, of course, there's one other thing  we can do, and this is my favorite variation   for growing your shoulders with bands, and it's  called the cross body lateral raise. And you can   see right off the bat, one great advantage  here, similar to the stretch front raise,   is on getting a stretch on the mid delt. Something  that almost never happens in almost any variation   of a lateral raise, even when done with dumbbells.  You want to get this band across your body to get   that pre stretch and then forcibly drive your  arm up and across your body into abduction.   You can see the tension that's placed on the  middle delt here at the peak contraction. Try to   hold it for a second or two and then again, resist  that eccentric all the way across your body.    But lateral raises are not the only way to hit  the middle delt guys. There's two more ways that   are incredibly effective at getting the job done.  The first of which is actually called the banded   high pull. You see, it looks exactly like the  high pull that I recommend to you all the time   for building bigger shoulders with dumbbells.  And what this does is it not only introduces   the abduction that we need to get our middle  delts, but it has another component here   that's so often overlooked and that is some  additional external rotation at the shoulder that   can always be beneficial to producing not just  strong, but healthy shoulders. So, you can see,   just like with the dumbbells, I don't want my  elbows to beat my hands in the race to the top.   If I were to do that, I simply turn this into  an upright row, which we're not doing.    Instead, I want to have the hands be  higher than the elbows at the top,   which reinforces the external rotation I just  mentioned. But we have another option here,   too. It's called the hip hugger in the hip hugger,  you actually take to individual bands and you   double them up just like this, because we're going  to need the added resistance. And with your hands   hanging now just at your sides, all you want to do  is pretend like you're pulling up a pair of pants,   drag your hands up your hips until you get those  elbows out into abduction. At the very top of   the movement, it's important to hold the squeeze  for at least a brief second or two. This is where   you want to really reinforce that tension.  And now, as I mentioned earlier, that brings us",

        "text": "all the way around to the back side, to the rear  delt. And the first exercise I want you to do here   is called the Rear Delt Pull. You simply wrap the  band around your back and you're just going to do   a band pull apart, essentially. But how you grab  the band is essential to getting the full benefits   of this exercise. If you could grab the band with  an overhead grip, the tendency would be to try to   actually do an elbow extension to get the band  behind the body, but that's only shifting the   work to the triceps. Instead of you grab it like  this, now the focus is on moving the entire arm.   And with the arm being the focal point of the  movement now you're going to shift all that   load to the rear delt doing the reverse fly. But  you don't have to do it and standing only. As a   matter of fact, you can increase the intensity  and the focus one side at a time by doing this,   the alternating Bent Over Rear Delt Pull. You can  see the position is the same. As a matter of fact,   I get some additional benefits from the down  arm in terms of shoulder stability right up   into that shoulder blade. Either one of these  is a great way to target the rear delt and help   to get them to grow. Especially if you've  been ignoring them for far too long.    And that brings us to exercise number six. You  didn't think we get to the whole video without   doing a face pull, did you? Well, here you go.  Here's your obligatory face pull video. Guys,   you know I love this exercise. You also get the  extra rotation built in to hit that rotator cuff,   there's nothing better than a face pull. Maybe  whipped cream, but these are good, too.   So, you have guys, whether you're an Arnold  guy or a Stallone guy, the fact is--   Come on, Jeffrey, what about the Jesse guy? Like  I said before, he's the star of the show.   Arnold, with all due respect, could  you please let me finish my outro?    I'll be back.  Like I was saying, guys,   never underestimate the power of bands  when it comes to building muscle,   if you know how to use them. Guys, hopefully now  as far as your shoulders go, you know exactly what   to do. If you want to see more of these in this  series, make sure you leave your comments below.   Tell me what's the next and I'll make the video.  If you're looking for step by step programs, guys,   all of them are available over at athleanx.com.  In the meantime, if you haven't already done so,   make sure you click subscribe turn on your  notifications, so you never missed in a   video when we put one out. I told you I did back.    I'm gone, how about that? Oh, come on Jeffrey. I command.",
