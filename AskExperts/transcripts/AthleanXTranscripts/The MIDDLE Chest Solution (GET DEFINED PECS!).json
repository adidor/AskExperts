        "text": "What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Althleanx.com.  Today, we're talking about the inner chest,   that middle chest line that makes the chest what  it is, If you don't believe me, look what happens   when I actually take that line away, suddenly it's  less impressive. See, the fact is very much like   the abs, it's the attachment point that creates  the visual contrast that makes that muscle look   more impressive. If I took the same eight pack  that this guy has here and we remove the linea   alba and the tendinous attachments, it's suddenly  now becomes a one pack that even though the waist   circumference hasn't changed, it just doesn't  look so good anymore. So, what can you do if   you're lacking that middle line? Well, there's a  few things that you need to do. You need to create   that contrast and that contrast is created in two  ways. Number one, your anatomy that you were born   with. And secondly, your ability to grow this  muscle. I'm talking about the entire muscle,   not just the inner chest, that's not possible. But  let's talk about the anatomy. We break our muscle   market to do that. We know that the chest has an  attachment right here on the sternum, a tendinous   attachment. And with a tendon does it attaches to  the bone, it rides out into this muscle belly and   then goes out to another tendon to attach to the  arm. Well, the tendon attachment actually is in   your advantage because what it does is it doesn't  grow like a muscle belly does. So, it sutures   itself down to the bone that it attaches to, in  this case, the sternum, and it stays there.   But as we grow the muscle itself, we know  that that will stand out further and further,   creating that visual deepening of the chest  that creates that line. However, we also know   that there's another thing that can hide that, and  that is what you eat. Right? Let's face it, guys,   any discussion of how a muscle looks has also  got to consider the fact that if you eat poorly,   you have higher levels of body fat, it's  just not going to look as good. See, this   chest of mine right here, though it may not be the  biggest one out there, because I have good muscle   definition from low body fat levels, it looks  more impressive than it actually might be.    Again, this guy right here has a bigger chest  than I do, but he certainly doesn't have the   definition. Which, again, in the opinion of  whoever is looking at that, could change how   they feel about it. The other thing, though, is  training. We know that we can impact our training   by how we do what we do. And the thing you're  going to want to make sure you do is two things.   Number one, don't isolate your training focus  to just strength. If you're isolating to just   strength, you're likely never going to develop  the type of inner chest that you're looking   for. And there's a reason for that. Most of the  strength-based exercises that are looking for   a strictly progressive overload, which is a good  hypertrophy stimulus, but it's not the only one,   are going to be limiting how much adduction  you get in the exercise you're performing.   I mean, an incline bench press or a flat bench  press or a weighted to dip or a weighted push   up or are going to be done with the arms in  this position here, never actually approaching   complete chest contraction by getting into a fully  educated state. You want to explore other options.   We know that eccentric overload is a great option.  We want to include exercises that allow us to get   more stress placed on the origin in the assertion,  which is an exercise like this allows you to do.   But you want to allow that to be an additional  stimulus for growth, because, again, growth is   what's going to make this entire chest stand out  and create the deepening of the line. The third   thing, however, is I think where everything is at,  where people don't necessarily do enough of this,   and that is go for that metabolic route, drop  the weight down. If you drop the weight down,   you may actually get into a fully contracted  state for the first time ever because you need   to go a little bit lighter in order to get there.  So, if you take an exercise like the crossover,   if you always stop right here, you're never really  getting it to a fully contracted state. If we're   talking about getting the best chest development  to create maximum hypertrophy and the most   deep line, you can get that, then you want to  make sure you take it even further than that.   Bring it all the way across the body, even  if it means lighten the load to do that.    Now, don't just stop after a few repetitions, you  want to really, really revel in the burn and such   an intense burn here on these exercises that  you can barely stand it. But this is a great   way to create that full chest contraction. You  do the same thing for the upper chest by simply",

        "text": "lowering the angle of the arm and bringing it up  and across your body, but still make sure you're   getting it across your body. Even something like a  bench press, if you were to drop one dumbbell can   be tweaked to get more adduction stress by simply  sliding over. Right? Shifting your body, rotating   onto one cheek and then driving your arm up and  across your body like you see me doing here.   And of course, you can do the dumbbell pull over,  which is really squeezing the hands together,   creating a really hard adduction from the top down  to really hit the upper chest better. But the fact   is, guys, all of these exercises are going to  allow you to create a better overall contraction,   not isolate the inner chest fibers. That's not  necessarily possible. However, we do have some   science to support the fact that doing these full  range of motion exercises or as I call them, full   range of contraction exercises, we can actually  include some additional fibers into the job.   There's a thing called the non-spinning chest  fiber that actually starts here on the sternum   and it heads out towards the arm, but never  quite makes it. So, you might think to yourself,   how could they contribute to a contraction  that they actually don't attach to the arm   it's pulling? Well, interestingly, what happens  is these fibers have proteins that come out of   them that make them somewhat sticky. So as the  contracting fibers cross over and slide by them   on the way through full contraction, they  grab hold of them, and they involve them in   the contraction. So, you're getting an overall,  greater production of force and greater capacity   for growth by involving fibers that maybe never,  ever got dragged along for the ride or engaged   because you never went far enough. So, the fact  is, guys start taking these exercises all the   way through full range of motion, even if it means  lightening the weight and I promise you, you are   going to start to see better results. If you're looking for a step-by-step meal plan,   guys, because again, nutrition matters. I  have them included in all my programs as   well as all of our step-by-step workouts to get  the job done.
