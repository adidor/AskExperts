        "text": "so when it comes to the foods you're actually putting on your plate the place i want you to focus first and foremost is on your proteins because when you're trying to create a caloric deficit pulling from your proteins is not going to be the wisest option because we need them to support our hard efforts in the gym if you want to maximize that calorie out portion of the equation you're going to have to support your heart training efforts with protein and to do that we're looking at 0.7 to 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight so where else would you pull from we have two options carbohydrates or fats and for those that already have higher fat diets it's an easy choice and not just that it's a good economical choice because we know that fats have twice as many calories on a gram per gram basis as carbohydrates and proteins which makes them a wise choice in terms of creating a deficit more quickly that being said carbohydrates are also an option but you want to be careful there because going too low can introduce another problem which we need to talk about now look i don't have this big love of feral carbohydrates but i do love me some sweet potatoes but the fact is i know one thing about them they're the most gratifying of all macronutrients right the most satisfying to eat they literally put the comfort and comfort food and make us feel good about what we're eating and looking to cut them down dramatically or to cut them out completely is a giant mistake but what happens is people's motivation sometimes leads to the wrong choices and they're so motivated to make a change that they want to go as far away from the current path that they're on thinking that the big changes are going to lead to big results and faster results and that's not what happens guys because what happens ultimately is that you take such a departure from the lifestyle path that",

        "text": "them so what i ask you to do is kind of use my baseball analogy the batting average the great ty cobb was a 366 hitter and he's in the hall of fame but what that means is every six and a half times up to the plate he made an out well guess what you don't have to be perfect either if you can bat 800 you'll be doing really really really damn good so what that means is eight out of every 10 meals you have make sure they're good ones so if you break it across an entire week it becomes even that much more achievable because you realize that let's say you eat four or five times a day times seven days a week that's 35 meals in a week 80 of that is 28. if you could do well 28 times and maybe not so well seven times not only is that well within your reach to be able to do that but you're going to be seeing yourself take a giant step in the direction of the leanness you desire and what happens is you gain the extra motivation to continue those changes if you desire to go even lower than that and that right there is how getting lean actually almost becomes automatic guys remember too big of a departure from the path is only going to set you up for failure and for this video failure is not an option and so with that you now have a step-by-step game plan for getting lean with no bs involved guys if you just follow the path i told you here i promise you you will get results because it works every single time not to mention think about the calories you burn just taking that one lap around the gym with me guys if you're looking for a plan where we put together step-by-step meal plans and workouts to make sure you don't fail head over to athletics.com in the meantime if you found the video helpful make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up let me know what else you want to cover i'll do my best to do that for you and also if you haven't done so click subscribe and turn your notifications so you never miss a",
