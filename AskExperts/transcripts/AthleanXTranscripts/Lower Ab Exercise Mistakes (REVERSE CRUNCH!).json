        "text": "what's up guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com so today I'm going to show you the right way to do a reverse crunch because the reverse crunch is a great lower ab bottom-up movement to help us develop those lower abs better if we do it the right way you see there's a lot of ways to do the reverse crunch you can do it with straight legs if you do with bent legs which is the best way to do it let's show you right now first of all let me show you some of the ways that you probably either have done them yourself or see others doing them right here I'm showing you an example that's actually one of the more common ways that you'll see it done but it's actually the worst way to do it because you're actually making the exercise the easiest at what's supposed to be the hardest point in the range of motion when you get to the very very top we call this the heels to the heavens you really should be trying to press your heels right directly up into the ceiling but if you allow your heels to go past that point past vertical to point where they're over your head think about it guys now gravity is actually helping you it's pushing your legs back in that direction and taking all the work off of the ABS so you want to definitely stop it vertical in terms of how far back you go if you want this exercise to stay with the focus on the lower abs next to see a whole hell of a lot of momentum being used in this exercise because we have the opportunity to rock on our own tail bones rock on our pelvis and get a lot of momentum going in that backwards direction the goal here guys is never again with ab work or anything else it's not just to reach a certain numbers to do it the right way so even if you cut down your rep significally by doing this the way I'm showing you today you're gonna get better effort out of your abs and that's the whole point of this is in the first place so you don't want to use this extreme lamenting that I'm showing",

        "text": "you here when I'm literally pulling the weight of my legs back allowing it to help me get back up and then actually not controlling them at all as they work their way back down towards the ground in both cases not something you want to do the next thing you'll see is this shortening of the legs and this happens a lot just as an automatic compensation because remember our bodies are smarter than we are we're going to look for the easy way out when you're trying to challenge yourself and change yourself and ain't going to happen if you take the easy road out well if I show you here well about you'll get a better idea watch as I bring my feet up towards the top everything looks good but when I lower my legs back down to the ground because I don't want to have to control all the weight of my legs against gravity I can shorten them I can shorten them by just bending at my knees now there's not as much weight having to be controlled against the force of gravity so let's just say my legs weighed 50 pounds apiece now they might weigh 25 pounds apiece because we've shortened the distance of how much is exposed to the force of gravity so it makes it a lot easier for us then when we get back down to the ground we automatically think we're doing it right because we straighten the legs out and then lift up again probably using some more of that momentum if you want to make this really really effective you've got to try to maximize the length of your legs all the way back down or as I'm gonna show you the next step maybe not all the way down but at least get them as long as you can possibly make them by making a concerted effort to straighten out contract your quads make your legs as straight as it can be to increase the amount of weight that your lower abs will have to handle and lastly picking up on that point I just referenced maybe sometimes you don't want to go all the way back down",
