        "text": "What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com.  Today, I have a 10-minute hold at work out for   you based off of a recent appearance I made  on Kelly and Ryan, where I was asked to name   the worst ab exercises. Well, you see guys,  the problem with these exercises is that they   actually overwork your hip flexors. So, they're  giving you abs, they also give you back pain, too.   I'm not going to do that to you. I'm going to  give you a step by step follow along workout   that you can do. And I mean, everyone can do this  because all you need is a mat and a hardwood floor   and some space in your apartment or your home,  and you won't be able to get this done. Remember,   beginners, you can do this. You go for  as long as you can. Each of the exercises   scripted for one minute, you go for as long as  you can. The entire set rest period. I'm going   to explain with the next exercise is and how to  do it. You ready? Let's knock this one out.    The first five exercises are starting down  here on the mat. And the goal, again, is to   get those hip flexors out of it and make your  abs do more of the work. And we start here for   something called the Halo. And unlike that Lying  Leg Raise where you actually use too much of your   legs to just simply lift your legs up and down,  we don't care about the legs as much as we care   about the pelvis. Your goal is to simply get your  pelvis up off the mat, every single repetition.   Now, your feet, they actually do the work. They're  creating clockwise circles for 30 seconds at the   top and then counterclockwise circles for  the other 30 seconds of this minute.    Good job on that one, guys, the next one here  is a variation of a standard sit up. Instead of   anchoring your feet under something which only  promotes the hip flexors to do the work to pull   your body off the ground, we can do this  is called a Frog Crunch. You put your feet   together and you press them together as  hard as you can. You should instantly   feel your hamstrings light up. With your  hamstrings activated your hip flexors are   going to take a little bit of a nap here  and make your abs do all the work.   Next, I'm going to shift the focus a little bit  now to the obliques. And to do that, we know   we have to rotate, not just tap your hands back  and forth, like in a traditional Russian Twist,   I mean, rotate. So, to take those hip lectures  out of this, guys, remember, keep your heels   down. There's no need to have to lift them up  on this. Instead, focus on what really matters,   and that is creating that rotation. And that's  going to come through pulling your elbow back,   actually rowing it back to each side when  you twist it to each side. You'll feel   the difference immediately and when you do,  you'll know you're doing it the right way.   Keeping the focus here on the obliques, we don't  ever have to do another dumbbell side bend. As a   matter of fact, as I said, you don't need to  use any equipment to get a good ab workout   as you're finding out. This one is called the Side  Plank Thread the Needle. That's what we're doing,   is mimicking that side bend without having to  actually ever do that, because we build the   lateral pillar strength from the bottom up. Lift  up, keep your arm up into the air. But then we   add that third dimension by reaching through and  creating some rotation that our body in core has   to control before 30 seconds on each side. You're  more than halfway home through this workout.   If you see my ab workouts you probably know I'm  not a big fan of the plank. Only because I think   it's a little bit too remedial and again, it tends  to work the hip flexors more than it does the   posterior chain or the muscles on the back side of  our body. But we can kill two birds with one stone   here and this is what the Black Widow Knee Slide.  You simply drive one knee towards the elbow,   pull up into a posterior tilt to really activate  the abs. And then don't forget that posterior   chain, you kick that leg back and extend the  hip all the way up to the ceiling, come back   down and alternate. Continue to perform this  for one minute or as long as you can hang in.   Now it's time to kick that mat out to the side and  put those socks on the hardwood floor or anything   that your feet will slide on. Guys, this is how  we can work the bottom-up ab movements without   having to lift the weight of our legs, like  in a hanging leg raise. To do this. instead of   pulling your knees straight in, which is going  to promote more of that hip flexor dominance,   you bring them out to the side. We call this the  Frog Circle. You can see the position of the legs   looks a bit like a frog, but what it's really  doing is activating hip external rotators instead",

        "text": "of hip flexors and still allowing you to pull from  the bottom up to really work those lower abs.    You're almost there, guys, one  left. This is the Sliding Ab   Tuck. Once again using that slick  floor, do not bend your knees here,   guys. All you're doing is lifting your pelvis  as high as you possibly can towards the ceiling   by simply hinging at the waist. If you do this  right, you'll feel your abs driving the movement.   And the only thing that can potentially cause  your knees to bend even a little bit is just   the flexibility of your hamstrings. Don't  worry. We'll get to that in another video.   The key is finish strong, keep those legs  straight, make your abs do the work.    So   there you have it guys, your ab workout  that's quickly going to become one of   your favorites because at the same time  is going to help you to get those abs,   it's not going to ruin your back in the process.  Guys, if you're looking for programs where we   break everything down step by step, including a  meal plan, that will help those ads of yours to   show you can find them over at Athleanx.com.  If you found the video helpful make sure you   leave your comments and thumbs up.
