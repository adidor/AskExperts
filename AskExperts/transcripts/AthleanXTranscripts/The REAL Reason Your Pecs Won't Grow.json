        "text": "So, you're having trouble and your chest just  won't grow. Well, I can relate because actually   I never really had the greatest chest, and even  to this day, it's not the best, but it certainly   has come a long way. And the reason why is because  I figured out what I was doing wrong, and I want   to share that reason with you here today. But I  do have to ask you a couple of questions and the   first one is, are you even bench pressing? And  see, this foundational exercise has to be a part   of your program if you want to give it a fair shot  and give your chest the best chance to grow. And   if you haven't done the exercise consistently  for at least the last year and a half,   then you really can't answer that question just  yet. Alternatively, how's your strength on the   exercise? Are you at least at one and a quarter  times your body weight? Because if you aren't,   again, I would suggest that you start here, make  sure you incorporate in this exercise. But if you   have and you're still not where you want to be,  well then, we need to ask the next question.    And that is, are you supplementing? And no, I  m not talking about what you re putting in your   body, I m talking about what else are you doing  in your chest workout. And no, I m not talking   about what you're putting in your body, I'm  talking about what else are you doing in your   chest workout? Because obviously the bench  press alone is not cutting it. So, what we   need to do is learn how else we could train the  chest for maximal effectiveness. And when you   re struggling to build bigger pecs, it's because  you just don't have good activation capabilities   of your chest. Oftentimes, it's the delts  that dominate the movements you're doing.    So, what I encourage you to do is find exercises  that can actually help you to adduct the arm   across the chest, not just towards  midline like we get with a bench   press or maybe even a dip or a pushup, but  actually bring your arm across the chest.   Because when we can train the chest to become more  active, to engage it on all the exercises we do,   well that's when the growth starts to happen.  If we don't have access to a cable machine,   then we would do something like a  Floor Fly with dumbbells. Again,   I like the Floor Fly because we don't run  into the same vulnerability to the shoulder   that we do with the unsupported Bench Fly. But  if you're doing some version of these adduction   exercises on your chest still will grow well at  that time. We've got to look in the mirror.    What's wrong, Jesse?  I'm looking in the mirror   and I don't really like what I see.  Oh, don't be hard on yourself. Look,   you re getting some gains there. But he could  actually help us explain what's going on. So,   when you're talking about the inability  to grow a bigger chest, at some point you   have to look at your genetics. Now before  you go and start hitting on mom and dad,   hear me out. What we're talking about is just  simply how much chest muscle can you grow?   Because no matter how much Jesse tries, or myself,  we're never going to look like Larry Wheels.   Kind of think of it, not many people look like  Larry Wheels. But we have to look at the skeleton   to understand why that is different. Skeletons are  going to have different genetic potential to add   muscle. If your clavicles are only this long,  you're not going to find this type of skeleton   in a guy like Larry Wheels because his are likely  to be a lot broader, a lot longer. And as they get   longer, you have a lot more room for chest muscle  to attach to. So, when you have a smaller frame   and a smaller skeleton, you're genetically going  to be limited to the overall size of your chest.   But before you use that as an excuse  understand that every single chest can   look good if properly trained. Now, granted,  it may not be as ridiculously full as Larry's,   but you can still optimize what you have a good  lower pec line, good middle chest definition,   and of course that upper chest ridge. But in  order to do this, we're going to have some   things that you're going to want to make sure  you're definitely doing in your workouts.   And it starts with just simply accepting the  fact that, yeah, maybe you have a little bit of   genetically compromised pecs here, but it doesn't  mean there's nothing that you can do. As a matter   of fact, if you learn to compartmentalize your  training, well, that's where the gains come true.   Because you can look back at that bench press and  just let it be a strength exercise. All right,   we talked about how maybe the adults were  helping you to push that bar off your chest",

        "text": "and gave you a good strength totals, but it still  wasn't growing your chest. So instead, that's   what you're doing on those other exercises that's  going to make the big difference. And what I want   you to do is simply change what you do, lighten  the weights, slow down the pace and learn to let   the muscle you're actually trying to grow do the  work. And one of my favorite ways to do that is   right here at a bench press. If I just activate  the chest at the beginning of every repetition,   it makes a difference. Instead of just having  the goal of being to get the dumbbells out over   my chest. I want to make sure my chest is what  initiates the upper portion of the rep every   single time. You can see that by pausing at the  bottom of the rep, it gives me that opportunity to   focus just a little bit on the chest, initiating  the rep and keeping those shoulders back.   I could do the same thing with a dip. We  know the dip is a great lower chest builder,   but how are you pushing up? Are you rounding  your shoulders on every rep? Not only is that   dangerous, but it's actually again letting the  shoulders do all the work. Instead, remember here   the goal is making the chest do all the work. And  we do that by slowing down the pace and initiating   with the chest out of the bottom of every single  rep of the dip. And one of my favorite ways to   make the pecs take over if you have access, is  with a Cable Bench Press. And again, you're not   forgoing the regular bench press. That's a solid  staple of your workout because you're using it to   build your strength. But this exercise is being  used to activate the pecs, and this is amazing   at doing that because it changes the angle of  push instead of pushing straight up and down as   you would with either a barbell or dumbbells, that  slight outward orientation of the cable's forces   your pecs to activate more again towards that  abduction line of resistance. That makes this   much more effective at instantly engaging  that muscle that you can't grow right now.    And then finally, if you have no access to  equipment, you still want to see the benefits here   a pushup. And the best way to do this, guys again  slow down the cadence. I can cut down whatever rep   count you're doing right now by simply making  you go slower. But the real key lies in getting   that sternum up on every repetition. Feel as if  you're lifting it up as you squeeze your body   off the floor, rather than just simply pushing  yourself off the floor. When you change the   way you do the exercises you're doing, guys. The  effect is entirely different, and when the effect   is changed and the activation of the pecs is  increased, that's where the real gains start.    So, if you trust in the process guys and follow  the steps I laid out here, I promise you your   days of pec stubbornness are going to be long gone  now. If it's your lower chest, that's giving you a   problem. You know, some of that sagging is you're  going to want to make sure you watch this video   here. Our lower test solution is your upper chest  that just won't stand at attention.
