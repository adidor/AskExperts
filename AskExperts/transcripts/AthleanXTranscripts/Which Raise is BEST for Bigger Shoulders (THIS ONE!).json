        "text": "What's up, guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com. So,  I talked about the Side Lateral Raise before. I   said never pour the pitchers when you're doing  it. Why? Because you're wasting a good bottle   of water. But also, you might be damaging your  shoulder because we don't like this internal   rotation with elevation that we get from the  exercise, especially when we can do it a different   way. But maybe you're asking another question, Is  that the best way to do a lateral raise? Because   I see people do a whole bunch of different  ways. Bent arm, straight arm. Let's cover   the side range first with the straight arm.  The first thing that's going to happen is you're   going to have to use a lighter weight.  Why? Because as the moment arm increases,   the length of the arm increases than the weight in  your hand is going to have to decrease in order to   be able to handle it. But don't be discouraged  because your shoulders can't read what this   number is on the side of the dumbbell. They only  feel the tension in the muscle that's working,   and as long as the tension is high enough, you're  going to grow even if you're using something   towards the lighter end of the rack.  However, you can do something that makes   this exercise even more effective, and it starts  with understanding how the dumbbell variation of   it actually affects the shoulder. Because we know  that when you do it with a dumbbell, the easiest   part of the exercise is going to be the bottom  part here because we're not subjected to gravity   fully like we are at the top. Well, if we had to  choose a weight for the exercise that's something   we can handle up here. We know it's going to  be far too light and not challenging enough   in the bottom part of the range of motion.  But this is where people confuse the range of   motion of an exercise that's effective versus  the range of motion of a joint. And sometimes   the motion should be abbreviated to remain in  the effective range. So, I've talked about if   you were going to do the straight arm raise, limit  the range of motion to the top half because this   is going to remain challenging no matter where or  what light type of weight you put in your hand.   You can go all the way down if you want, come up  and do it in a one- and one-half style. But again,   try to perform the majority of the  work in that abbreviated range.    Now, if you're going to do the bent arm lateral  raise, first thing you want to do is increase the   weight. Because we know mathematically through  physics that if that moment arm is shortened,   you're going to effectively be able to handle  a heavier weight to make that tension feel the   same in the working muscle. And in this case,  you're only going to want to take about half   the weight of the weight you were using and  add that to that weight, to get the weight,   you should be able to handle with a bent arm.  So, if I was eating a 20-pound dumbbell to perform   a straight raise, add half of that 10 additional  pounds, it's going to give you about 30 pounds.   So now I should be able to feel about the same  tension in the muscle with a 30-pound dumbbell   done with the arm in this bent position.  But a couple of things happen here that   you need to be aware of. First of all, you're  introducing another lever arm. This time is not   just the arm length from here to here, but  not even introduce a lever arm from here to   here that goes in this direction anteriorly.  And two things happen because of that. When I have   a weight in my hand here, it's going to want  to pull me down in this direction. And that's   something you want to be careful of, because if  we pull down, this is still internal rotation,   the same way it was when I was doing the  pour of the pitcher from the top. So,   I want to make sure I always have my wrist  in hand above my elbow. Meaning I don't want   to have the pinkies high and thumbs down, but  the thumbs high and the pinkies down and again,   wrist above elbow. That's the first thing.  The second thing is when you have that anterior   displacement through a bent arm lateral raise,  it can tend to not only push this down but make   the front delts want to do more of the work to  get that weight back up, which is defeating the   purpose of trying to build that middle delt. So,  if you're going to do that Bent Arm Lateral Raise,   you're going to want to have the weight staying  relatively in line with your torso, so not out   in front of you. So, when you do that, you just  let the elbow drift back behind you and keep that   dumbbell pretty much in line with the body.  And again, tension wise, it should feel pretty   similar because the adaptation was made by  increasing the dumbbell weight to just keep",

        "text": "that tension high inside of the delt. But it  still has the same issues as the dumbbell did   in terms of the resistance curve and strength  curve. So how can we maybe fix that? Well,   that's where you have to look at something like a  Cable Lateral Raise, because the cable now becomes   a line of resistance. And if the cable can remain  perpendicular to in the straight arm version here,   the forearm, then we're going to have tension  right from the very beginning exercise where   it's pretty much absent in the other version  of the lateral raise, the dumbbell.   Right off the bat we've got tension here because  it's perpendicular to that forearm. So, we're   going to have a really nicely loaded exercise when  the shoulders are at their strongest and even at   the top when they're not so strong, there's still  some tension here, but it's less right, because   we've got this less degree of perpendicular  of this line of force to the forearm. So,   this is a great way to do the exercise. However, I  think you have to look at that one last variation   and that is, what if I was going to take the arm  and bend it again and still do it with the cable?   And this is where I think you get the best of  all worlds, because now I can not only bring   it across my body to get more of a stretch at the  beginning. But now when I come up to the top, I've   got more perpendicularly still remaining because  the arm, the lever arm is now existing in this   plane that was not there when we were straight. Right now, I'm still in this position, so there's   more tension even at the top. So, I'm down across  my body, I get that stretch and it can come up and   it crossed. So, I kind of have the best of all  worlds here. And what I like to do is take the   opportunity again to load this heavier because we  know we can because of the bent arm position to   allow me to cheat it up, still have to control it  and then control that eccentric on the way down.   So, introducing another stimulus for growth with  the controlled eccentric across your body. So, if   I had to give one the title of the best, I would  say it's the Cable Bent Arm Lateral Raise. But   every single version of the exercise can be done  to your benefit and can certainly be done to grow   bigger shoulders if you know how to use them.
