        "text": "the next exercise up here is another way to build the front delt and it's actually something you could do a little bit more explosively or you can slow it down for a little bit more concentrated attention it's a variation of something I showed you before called the scoop press and with the scoop press another great way to build the front delt you're actually just locking out that arm and 90 degrees and then allowing your body that continue that press up overhead so you work that front delt up to the top and then press overhead here though we're not necessarily looking at the press overhead as much as we're looking at the press out and we get our arms out and by lengthening our arms out in front of our body the weight that we're holding feels instantly heavier because the moment arm of that weight becomes substantially larger as we reach out which means in the long run more stimulus on that front delt and what's great about this is for people that do have shoulder problems whenever they do press overhead you're not going to run into that same situation because you're able to press away from your body but keep the elevation limited so it doesn't place any impingement stress on your shoulder if you're looking for a little bit of a change when it comes to the stimulus that you have for your front delt in other words getting away from just all the heavy work you can go for the metabolic stress and overload with something here called a plate and all you got to do is grab a plate preferably here as heavy as you can handle but still something you can handle for a long period of time meaning about 45 seconds to a minute or even a little bit longer and your goal here is to simply make some eights in the air as if they're laying on their side all you have to do is keep your arms out and extend it as long as they possibly can be for as long as you can the great thing about this is similar to what I",

        "text": "just mentioned the last exercise you can modify this load by shortening the moment arm and bringing the plate a little bit closer as you fatigue this is a buster guys but I promise you it's worth it now moving on to the rear delt this is where the real gains are to be had why because it has the greatest capacity for growth why because a lot of us skipping it's the truth we just don't do enough rear delt work it's one of those back side posterior chain muscles that we don't ever pay enough attention to but I'm going to change that here for you today the fastest way for you to do that is to realize that the rear delt fly is not your best friend when it comes to building the rear delt if you really want to train this muscle you got to make sure that you're getting the arm not just to the level of the body here but back behind the body the most key activation technique you can use is to figure out exercises that allow you to get your arm behind your body into extension you get some bonus points if you can get some extra or rotation at the shoulder as well the good thing about these movements is it's going to do all of those things the first move up here is called the rear delt row focusing mostly on that extension of the arm behind the body and the other benefit we get here is that I can actually get a little bit that external rotation you can see as I pull the dumbbell up towards my shoulder I'm actually trying to rotate my hand backwards at the same time almost like I'm trying to point my thumb at somebody who's standing behind me that gives me the combination of the external rotation with the extension of the elbow back behind the body as a matter of fact you can probably feel it right now sitting where you are without even having to hold a weight it's a great way to target the rear delt and it's just one of the ways that you're going to want to do so if you want to get that area to start",

        "text": "growing the next one actually gives you a chance to hit that rear delt with just your own bodyweight you need any extra equipment it's called the back Widow you'll see here is the common trait that your arms are really focused on getting back behind your body you see I positioned myself on the ground and all I'm trying to do is dig my elbows in and push my body away get that chest elevated up and away from the ground and you can see how much elevation there is me you look at it from behind here in getting the arm into extension that's gonna light that rear delt up again regards to the fact that you're not even using any equipment one of the things that's always bothered me when it comes to rear delt training is people think you have to always go light in order to build them it's not the case as a matter of fact one of the best ways that you can build your rear delts is to just sit down and do a heavy seated row but there are a couple things that you can do to actually make this work that we are dealt a little bit more first of all you want to get those elbows out away from your sides the tighter they are to the sides the more lat you're going to involve more so we can actually change the position of our hands in the direction of pull instead of taking a fully pronated overhand position we want to try to think about pulling our hands backwards getting the back of our hand to face somebody behind us and when we do that we're getting a little bit more of that rotation pull combining the effect of extension and a little bit of shoulder external rotation to really really target that rear side and if you want an alternative here you could actually use a lat pulldown machine and do the same thing and standing without having to abandon the mechanics that actually work on the last exercise you can do this simply by posting your foot up and aiming once again to get the elbows high and back as far as you",
