        "text": "the isolatory focus here you tend to usually be able to get out around two or three reps at minimum after every single rest pause period however even if that's not the case for you just continue to get as many as you possibly can pushing yourself as hard as possible to ensure that you are performing effective reps and let the ships fall where they may when you reach your 20 reps you've completed your work for this exercise which brings us to the fifth exercise in this workout and the third time we're hitting our biceps this time with one of my favorite ways to do it is called the bicep chin up but only in this case serving as our ignition set weapon of choice because what you're going to do is perform a set to failure and the difference between this and a regular chin up is just simply the angle of the elbow when you're performing it open up that distance a little bit more create more of a 90 degree angle at your elbow as you perform the exercise to ensure that more of the focus is on the biceps and less of it is on the lats now once you've reached failure here the revs actually start but this case we're doing 10 effective reps and guess what you're only doing one at a time you see because now we're going to perform something called the negative chin hold where you raise yourself up over that bar and simply just fight that negative one time on the way down and all I want to see here is as slower descent as you could possibly make in other words how much can you fight this and if you feel that you're struggling here and you can't really even support the weight of your body you can do a couple things the easiest thing is just simply to have a bench underneath you and use your foot as a kickstand to sort of unweight some of the weight of your body it works really easily and it doesn't disrupt the flow of the exercise after you've reached failure on that rep you're going to do as you've always done in this",
