        "text": "do if you do it right and getting down to the ground matters but the second thing that matters is actually getting all the way back up and I mean all the way like fully extending your elbows it makes all the difference those last two to three inches can change the effectiveness of the entire exercise all right so here's what you're gonna do you're gonna start by figuring out how many pull-ups you can do in a single set so if you can do more than 15 pull-ups in a set like I can then you would start here and you would be doing 20 pull-ups in 20 push-ups in the first minute you see this actually becomes a child within the workout see if you're gonna get all of this done in that timeframe and I guarantee you it is I'm going to show you in a second that it's possible if you fall between 10 and 15 pull-ups then that will put you in the next category and that's actually Jesse you'd be performing 15 pull-ups and the same 20 push-ups within that minute next up if you could do between 5 and 10 pull-ups then you would do either a choice here 10 pull-ups and 20 push-ups within the first minute or you have an option to switch that other exercise that we talked about which is the inverted row in that case you'd be doing 20 of those and again 20 push-ups and finally if you can do less than 5 pull-ups in a single set don't worry I said I'd have a challenge for everybody you would do 15 of the inverted rows and 15 push-ups but this time from your knees are so now here's where the fun begins what you do is you get your timer and you get up on the bar and you start going and here now again the goal is one minute can you get that rep range done depending upon where you've started within that one minute time you can see I'm over here on the left I'm doing 20 and 20 and Jesse's over here on the right and he's doing 15 and 20 now let me give you a little hint here I'm not even gonna attempt to do all 20 pull-ups",

        "text": "because if I find that I failed it's gonna be very hard for me to get back up there again and bang out my pull-ups or at least in subsequent sets that's right I said subsequent sets because I'm gonna tell you that this is going to continue as we build out the workout but for now you chunk it down you come up with a strategy you'll see here I actually did 15 of them I banged out all 20 push-ups and then when I hop back up on the bar I'm trying to get my final five Jesse actually did the same he did ten of the 15 that he had to do he hopped down and banged out all of his push-ups and he came back up to the bar to get to finish out his final five again you find the strategy that works for you but you're gonna need something because it's the only way you're gonna survive so now if you made it first of all congratulations but don't get too glad with yourself at the moment because there's more work to do you see I told you I'd build this into an entire workout so you've just completed the one-minute time period now you've earned one minute rest so the top of the second minute you start going again and your goal is to repeat what you just did - two reps so if you did 20 repetitions of pull-ups and push-ups your goal now is to do 18 and 18 within that same woman a time period and you're gonna continue to progress this way the fourth minute the sixth minute the eighth minute and the 10th minute dropping down from 16 to 14 to 12 to 10 so now when you've reached this part guess what you're actually only halfway done because you've got to work your way back up now I know that probably seems impossible but I promise you you can actually do this but what's going to happen here is two things the time that you get to do the exercise is increasing from 1 minute to 2 minutes and the rest period that you get in between these individual attempts is going to bump up as well to 2 minutes so now what you do is you jump back in at",
