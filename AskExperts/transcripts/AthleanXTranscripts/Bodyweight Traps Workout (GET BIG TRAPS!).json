        "text": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. Your traps are, by far, one of the most important muscle groups in your entire back. As a matter of fact, they take up a large area of space. Almost a big diamond shape here with different functions. You see, it's not all about shrugging and seeing how much weight you can shrug. As a matter of fact, today I'm going to show you a bodyweight trap workout that's going to hit all of the major functions of the traps because you probably aren't aware of all of them if you are just concentrating on lifting your shoulders up and putting them down. So let me show you the actual exercises. I'm going to break out a little bit of animation here as well to help you really see what's going on with these muscles. Okay, so the first exercise here is actually working from the bottom up, opposite of what you would think. Instead of lifting the shoulders ups we're actually trying to depress them and pull them down. You can see here, that's the function of the lower trap. The fibers are oriented that way; to pull down. Of course, the upper traps are working here to eccentrically control that. So you're actually still getting upper trap working. You can see that happening in my upper back, but we're hitting them both here. Next, we're working on another function of the traps, and that is, again, eccentrically controlling the retraction of them. See, they pull them together, but we're actually trying to control that with that first portion of this exercise. See, as you come up here, as I push out, I'm actually trying to eccentrically control that motion. Yeah, when they work they're going to pull in and retract the scapula, but we've got to actually control that. The next part, again, is to depress the scapula. Work those lower traps and just by sliding forward here you could see I'm pulling down, actively working those lower traps to try to initiate that movement. See, I can do that as I slide forward on my toes. Next we have our power push weight. This is actually form our ATHLEAN0 program. Now we're getting to the more classic function of the traps, which is that elevation of the shoulders. So as I push away I'm using all I can in my traps to squeeze and push my body away. You can see here, this is that elevation function of the traps. Contracting to push, now, the body away. Here you go, you can see I'm actually doing that. we also have upwardly rotating scapula, which is another function of the upper traps. You can see here, as I push away we're rotating the scapula up and to the side. There's my buddy, Raymond, sporting the new ATHLEANRX shirt. Now we jump up to the pullup bar. Again, another thing to work the lower traps. Lower traps don’t get worked. Not often enough, at least. So we're going to do that here by working on pulling down on the scapula. You can see gravity just wants to have my body fall down, but I've got to actively engage",

        "text": "those lower traps to pull my body back up. Next we move on to this exercise. This is a tough one. This is actually getting a whole lot of function here of the traps. Different functions. You're just trying to anchor your feet on the ground and slide forward. All the pull – it's like a reverse lever. All the pull is happening here, with the elevation of the scapula, and then the retraction trying to hold this against gravity. This one is a killer. Then finally, we kind of combine everything together. I've called this one before the Angel and the Devil. Basically, this is the devil. It feels so easy. It looks so easy, but look at everything going on here. We have scapular retraction right there. We have rotation, upwardly rotating there. We have the elevation of the scapula. Again, more upper traps. We have now, again, the retraction. We have the depression of the scapula. We're hitting lower traps, upper traps; we're literally hitting everything with this exercise. So there you have it, guys. Putting the science back in strength and helping you to see exactly what's going on so that you can understand what's going on, so that when you find those times when you have no equipment around you, but you don’t know what to do; you think you can't get a workout in, especially for your back. It's not true. As a matter of fact, our ATHLEAN0 program shows you how to put together a complete workout program over six weeks with no equipment at all. Not even a pullup bar, like I showed you in this video. That's over at ATHLEANX.com. In the meantime, if you've found this video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below and let me know what you want me to cover here on this channel and I'll do my best to do that. All right, guys. I'll be back here again really soon. See ya.",
