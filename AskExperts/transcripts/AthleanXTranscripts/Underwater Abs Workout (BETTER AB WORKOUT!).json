You see, under water ab training provides you with a unique opportunity to train your abs in a way that you're not likely training them at the moment, and it gives you the conveniences of not having to have equipment around you in order to do it. Here's what we're talking about: when you're in the water, as you can see me here, you can actually do a lot of different movements to train you abs and it goes back to what we talk about all the time when it comes to ab training. That is the importance of rotation. You cannot fully train your abs if you're not working on A) producing rotation; B) controlling rotation; and C) preventing rotation. The good thing about water training is that you're actually creating force in both directions on the same rep. so as you see me move here from left to right, you can see that I'm creating resistance become I'm overcoming the force of the water, or the drag of the water as I move across. Now, more importantly, because I've done that I've created momentum of the water in that direction. So if I immediately move back in the other direction, I've now got to overcome that momentum of the water. So it's actually an increased force on the way back. That's not something we actually have the opportunity to do when we're training on land, unless we get more of an elaborate setup. Back to these exercises, I don’t just have to do a left to right plane of motion here. I can use diagonals and go from top, upper top, down to lower bottom. I can move myself in those directions in crisscross patterns. I can move in a combination of these. The idea is that using your own arms here as resistance creates an opportunity to train your abs in both movements, or both directions simultaneously. Now, if you're on land – and I get it, you don’t want to train under the water, or you don’t really feel like getting wet – no problem. You can come into the gym and you could try to recreate this. Keep in mind if you use just one band you're not going to get that resistance in the direction back. You can get eccentric control, but you're not going to get this concentric that you have to overcome unless you do what I'm showing you here, which is a little bit more of an elaborate setup, which will require two bands anchored on each side of you. You rotate to one direction – obviously you're using the resistance of the band on that opposite side – and then you rotate back in the other direction and you're using the resistance of the other band. Now, keep in mind one last thing when it comes to this type of training. If you're training on land, if you're using a cable machine, you're going to have to increase the weight to increase the resistance over time. If you're using bands you're going to have to increase the thickness here of the tubing to increase the resistance over time. If you're in water, all you have to do is increase the surface area of whatever you are moving through the water. So I don’t have to just use my arms, I can use something bigger.",

        "text": "I have a kick board here, or a paddleboard, that could move through the water. That's going to make that a lot harder. You can see me doing that right here. So no matter how you decide to train your abs, guys, remember the important thing is making sure you have a hefty dose of rotational work built in. It's not just producing the motion of rotation, but it's also controlling and at times preventing it as well. I cover all these things in our ATHLEANX 6-Pack Promise app. It's actually the top rated ab workout app on the market. It's available for both iPhone and Android. You can get it in the links below. In the meantime, if you're looking for a complete, step-by-step plan, you're not just getting abs, but you're building the entire athletic body; head to ATHLEANX.com and get our ATHLEANX training system.
