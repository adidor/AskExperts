        "text": "What's up, guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com.Â  What you're about to watch is the most effectiveÂ Â  back workout you've ever done. Because it'sÂ  part of my 100 Series where I'm getting youÂ Â  to increase the efficacy of your workoutsÂ  by increasing the efficiency of the repsÂ Â  you perform. Here I m getting you to focus onÂ  trading in junk volume for something we knowÂ Â  that is much more effective, Effective Reps.  You see, when you perform a set of 12 reps toÂ Â  failure traditionally, you're actually not puttingÂ  in all that much effort on the first, let's sayÂ Â  six, seven or eight reps. They're just being doneÂ  to fatigue you to get to the ones that are moreÂ Â  difficult and ultimately results producing. ButÂ  when you perform effective rep training, you'reÂ Â  essentially cutting the line. But you're jumpingÂ  to, the more difficult reps that allows for youÂ Â  to get more of the results, producing reps inÂ  less time and getting more from your workout.  Â  Now, this isn't new. It's actually been used byÂ  some of the greatest of all time. It's just oneÂ Â  of those underutilized, often overlookedÂ  techniques that can really produce gains,Â Â  especially if they haven't done it in aÂ  while. But as with all Athlean-X workouts,Â Â  it's not enough to know just what the techniqueÂ  is. It's the exercise selection and how youÂ Â  apply it that makes all the difference.  And when it comes to the effect of workouts here,Â Â  picking the right exercises is key. But moreÂ  than that, knowing what areas to train is alsoÂ Â  important. You see, for complete back developing,Â  you're going to want to train not only your lats,Â Â  but also, of course, your upper back, your traps,Â  your mid scap muscles, your rear delts and ofÂ Â  course your lats and low back. You see when youÂ  workout is fully developed, that's when you getÂ Â  full development. And that's where we startÂ  the workout off with the first exercise.  Â  And it's the Barbell Row, it s one of the bestÂ  horizontal pulling exercises that you can do. AndÂ Â  when you're ready to roll, what I want you to doÂ  is to load up a weight that will cause you to failÂ Â  in the exercise in the 12-rep range. Now, thisÂ  first set is something that we call the IgnitionÂ Â  Set. It's just priming you for the effective repÂ  total that we're going to accrue and the sets thatÂ Â  follow it. Again, you're likely not going toÂ  feel too, too much in the first six, seven orÂ Â  eight reps. That's part of that volume that isn'tÂ  necessarily producing the gains you're after. ButÂ Â  when you reach those more difficult ninth, 10th,Â  11th and finally 12th reps, well, that's actuallyÂ Â  where you want to make sure and dig down.  And again, when we're talking about failure here,Â Â  we're talking about form failure when theÂ  exercise is no longer recognizable as theÂ Â  Barbell Row we know and love, well, that's whereÂ  you need to stop. But don't go too far away,Â Â  because what I want you to do here is justÂ  take a quick 15 second rest-pause. And see,Â Â  by limiting the amount of rest in between setsÂ  here, we're more effectively getting back intoÂ Â  the more fatigued state of that muscle moreÂ  quickly. But the next time around, you're notÂ Â  going to perform a straight Barbell Row.  This time I'm going to allow you to use just aÂ Â  little bit of momentum. We're going to performÂ  something we call the Barbell Dead Row. So,Â Â  you start with a little bit of leg action offÂ  the ground as if you're performing a deadliftÂ Â  and then you row it the rest of the way. AndÂ  all I want you to do is perform these sets toÂ Â  failure and get as many reps as you possiblyÂ  can each time. The goal for the effective repsÂ Â  on this exercise is 20 total and however, manyÂ  rest pause intervals that might take you.  Â  You might knock off five or six after thatÂ  first set of 12, those are the first fiveÂ Â  or six that count towards your total. AndÂ  from there you continue to chip away untilÂ Â  you've reached those 20 effective reps and atÂ  that point, move on to the next exercise.  Â  Which is the Lat Pulldown. And after aÂ  3-to-4-minute rest, you should be ready to rollÂ Â  here and start up once again on another ignitionÂ  set, this time on this traditional verticalÂ Â  pulling exercise. And we're looking for here againÂ  is a well performed set, choosing a weight thatÂ Â  will cause you to fail in that 12-rep range.Â  Again, no shortcuts here because once again,Â Â  we know that this is priming us for what's toÂ  come. And when we reach failure here again,Â Â  you don't go too far away because your rest isÂ  just the 15 second rest-pause that you're goingÂ Â  to take. And once this 15 seconds is up, IÂ  get right back into the exercise again. Â  But as we saw in the first exercise, we start toÂ  hit those more difficult, but results producing",

        "text": "reps more quickly. And what I'm targeting here isÂ  about four or five or again, six repetitions andÂ Â  that's okay. Because as I chip away, set after setÂ  or after each rest-pause interval, I'm going toÂ Â  get myself eventually to my 20 effective reps.Â  When I jump back in again after my rest-pause,Â Â  I start cranking away again at those good,Â  solid, highly difficult repetitions.  Â  And that's where we go for the Seated CableÂ  Row, another horizontal pulling exercise, butÂ Â  one that's going to be a little bit easier on theÂ  low back because we don't have to be bending overÂ Â  when we perform it like the Barbell Row. But thisÂ  is a great exercise to actually allow us to startÂ Â  shifting that focus a little bit higher, more toÂ  the upper back and rear delts. I've said before,Â Â  this actually one of the better rear deltÂ  exercises that you can do, especially whenÂ Â  we perform it with a straight bar like this.  Because as I do this, my elbows start to go widerÂ Â  and higher, and as I do that, I get more extensionÂ  and start to activate more of that upper back asÂ Â  we know. And as always here, we're still doingÂ  that ignition set to that 12-rep failure. As I'mÂ Â  done, as you can see here, I take that brief 15Â  second rest and I get right back into it again.Â Â  The thing about pulling workouts is that on theÂ  second half of the exercise in these effectiveÂ Â  rep workouts, you can utilize a littleÂ  bit of momentum here to your favor.  Â  As you start to get a little bit more fatigued,Â  leaning a little bit forward and coming back withÂ Â  a little bit of a rock to let you get that barÂ  moving and you moving closer to your effectiveÂ Â  rep total without sacrificing the safety of theÂ  exercise by letting our form breakdown pass formÂ Â  failure. As always here guys, it doesn't matterÂ  how many repetitions you get after each subsequentÂ Â  rest-pause period. All you have to do is takeÂ  what your body is willing to give you, however,Â Â  many effective reps you can get, take yourÂ  rest-pause, and keep chipping away, as I said,Â Â  until you've reached that total of 20 effectiveÂ  reps. Which if you're counting at home, at thisÂ Â  point the workout, puts you a total of 60. But we're not done quite yet because now we goÂ Â  back to our vertical pulling exercises. This one'sÂ  one of my favorite and it starts from the groundÂ Â  up, we're talking about the High Pull. And whatÂ  this does is once again works that upper back theÂ Â  traps, the mid scap muscles that are all importantÂ  and oftentimes overlooked. And all you've gotÂ Â  to do here is pull the dumbbells up to yourÂ  shoulders. But be careful, this is not an UprightÂ Â  Row. As a matter of fact, it's very oppositeÂ  of an Upright Row. The elbows stay low, and theÂ Â  hands stay high rather than the elbows travelingÂ  higher than the wrist and hands. And once again,Â Â  the weight that you choose here is one that willÂ  cause that form failure in the 12-rep range.  Â  And just like you have with all the otherÂ  exercises in this workout, the ignition set isÂ Â  done just to sort of kick everything off becauseÂ  you once again have 20 more effective reps waitingÂ Â  for you after that first set. The difficultyÂ  level rises, but so will the effectivenessÂ Â  of what you're doing as well. Not to mention theÂ  efficiency too, because it's not going to take asÂ Â  many reps to get out of your workout what you'reÂ  trying to do right now with a much higher volume.Â Â  Finish up the last of those 20 effective repsÂ  and then meet me at the Lat Pulldown bar one moreÂ Â  time for the last exercise in the workout.Â  Unless you decide to take the option.  Â  And this time we actually going to flip theÂ  script a little bit, or at least the handÂ Â  placement to the Underhand Grip Lat Pulldown andÂ  we call these the ROM Pulldowns. In other words,Â Â  range of motion, full range of motion,Â  because I want you to get that elongated,Â Â  almost exaggerated stretch on the last at the topÂ  of every single one of these repetitions. We knowÂ Â  that applying stretch tension to the lats is aÂ  good way to stimulate additional growth. Well,Â Â  at this point in the workout, we're not goingÂ  to have to use as much weight. Realizing thatÂ Â  we have that slight pause at the top of every repÂ  with a little bit more of that apply tension.  Â  And as always, I worked my way through thatÂ  first initial ignition set, realizing that again,Â Â  even at this level of fatigue, these first fewÂ  repetitions probably won't be that challenging.Â Â  But if I've chosen the weight correctly, well,Â  things start to get serious as I get to theÂ Â  end of the set. I take my 15 second rest and IÂ  jump back in once again, now starting to workÂ Â  my way towards that 20 effective rep total.  And as I said before, the nice thing about theÂ Â  pulling exercises is that you get a little bitÂ  of that built in momentum. If I need it, I can",

        "text": "take it here. A little bit of a lean back of theÂ  torso is not going to hurt. As a matter of fact,Â Â  it might be what's needed to get you to thatÂ  final 20th rep. And so now with 100 reps inÂ Â  our 100 Back Workout, I mentioned that option.  If you're so crazy as to want to actually attemptÂ Â  this, then what you're going to want to do is takeÂ  one of these bars and set it up as an InvertedÂ Â  Row. You see, the Inverted Row is not only one ofÂ  my favorite back exercises, body weight or not,Â Â  but what it does is it once again kind of finishesÂ  off those mid scap muscles that oftentimes getsÂ Â  overlooked. But we're not going to do it as justÂ  an Inverted Row. You see, we do something calledÂ Â  a Static Hold Ladder where all you're going to doÂ  is get yourself up to the top of the repetitionÂ Â  with your feet either flat on the floor or withÂ  your legs extended out in front of you if you'reÂ Â  looking for something even more difficult. The idea is to pull your chest up as close as youÂ Â  can, get it to the bar and then hold that for fiveÂ  seconds. You see, these muscles tend to get veryÂ Â  weak over time because of poor posture. We want toÂ  train them for a little bit more muscle endurance,Â Â  so we're going to hold them up there in thisÂ  position. Your job here is to just simplyÂ Â  accumulate 20 effective reps. However, if youÂ  add up the time that you're holding, this isÂ Â  going to be 100 seconds of hold. With every singleÂ  repetition completed there's associated with it,Â Â  five seconds of the static hold at the top.  Again, consider this one an option, but realizeÂ Â  I'll be proud of you whether you do it orÂ  you don't. But I like you more if you do.Â Â  And so, if you have done this workout in aÂ  traditional way with Barbell Rows for four setsÂ Â  of 12, Lat Pulldowns, three sets of 12, SeatedÂ  Rows three sets of 12, Dumbbell High Pulls and theÂ Â  Underhand ROM Pulldowns, all for three sets of 12.Â  And if you did them the way you usually do them,Â Â  remember, the effective reps are relegated to lastÂ  three or generously four reps of the workout.  Â  So, you're going to wind up with if you doÂ  four, 16 for this exercise, 12, 12, 12 and 12,Â Â  which is 64 of those harder effective reps.Â  If you went and you only got sort of the lastÂ Â  three that were beneficial for you, then thatÂ  number comes all the way down to 48. When youÂ Â  do the work that I just showed you, you get intoÂ  those effective reps more quickly, like I said,Â Â  and you're also performing more of them. So youÂ  get more work done in a shorter period of timeÂ Â  and ultimately you trade in some of that workoutÂ  length for intensity, for better results.  Â  And so, as I'd like to do here for you guys onÂ  the channel, I'm going to give you a chance toÂ Â  just screenshot this, so you know exactlyÂ  what you have to do the next time you takeÂ Â  this to the gym and try it out. And speakingÂ  of trying it out, when are you going to tryÂ Â  the Chest Workout or the Shoulder Workout, youÂ  can find both of those over here. You're goingÂ Â  to want to make sure you do those too guys.
