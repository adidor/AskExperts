        "text": "What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com. I'm  going to show you today how to get your shoulders   growing again fast. And I promise you, if you  do exactly what I show you, it's going to work   for every single person that tries it. The  issue is your shoulders don't grow maybe as   fast as you want them to because you're doing a  couple of things wrong. Number one, you're not   training your Real Delt enough. And we talk about  shoulders, especially that front to back depth,   the Rear Delt is a large component,  not just a little bit of a component,   a large component of what we're talking about.  Anatomically, I was blessed with a couple of   freckles here that work as some landmarks. I want  to show you something. If I were to go in this   position here, this freckle is sort of towards the  front line of my Mid Delt, here's the split of the   Mid Delt. And this freckle back here is almost at,  about an inch ahead of the back side of my Rear   Delt. You can see when you look from the side,  this is the Front Delt right here, the whole rest   of the shoulder, the massing of it comes from  the Middle and the Rear Delt. So, we can get   an exercise that would allow us to build that,  we would be been doing good for ourselves.    The second thing is we don't necessarily train  the Rear Delt, and when we do heavy enough because   it's capable of handling heavier loads and when  we do that, that's when the magic happens. So,   here's what we do, we grab a set of dumbbells on  the ground kneeling. Now you can do this standing,   but the benefit of doing the kneeling position  is that you get away from some of the momentum   you might use from your lower body to do this. I  want to load this exercise a little bit heavier,   but make sure that the Rear Delt in the  Mid Delt are doing all the work.    So, I get in this position here and I grab my  dumbbells, I'm in this kneeling position. Now, I'm   going to do it as it's called the hip hugger. I'm  going to drag the dumbbells up towards my hips.   But at the same time, the key for me is to get  my elbows back behind my body as far as I can go.   Extension of the arm at the shoulder is  what drives the Rear Delt engagement.   The higher up into extension I get, the more that  Rear Delt I get. Okay, now the second thing I   know I need to have for that Mid Delt is we need  some abduction of the elbow away from the body.   So, I want to be able to get that out and abduct  the arm away from my body as much as I can.    But it's driven by the motion backwards.  Because if I stay in the front plain here,   the frontal plane, or if I go even a little bit  forward, what I do is I turn this into almost   a Kneeling Upright Row, which is no less shitty  than the Standing Upright Row. So, what I do is   I get here and that would be a bad position.  So, if I actually were to do this and be able   to stare down from my side here, stare in this  direction and see my elbows in front of my body,   I'm not doing it right. There are too far in  front, that's abduction without the extension   of the arm. If the elbow stays back behind my  body like it should and I look to the left. I   can't see my elbow, okay? I can't see any of that.  So that's what you want to look for. Peek that way   and see if you can see your elbow. So again, this position here,   I'm going to drive it into extension and then  get the abduction at the shoulder as well here,   up in there, up into extension and then that  abduction. Extension and abduction. I get a   good squeeze. Now, the weights I'm using here,  I kind of tweener weights. They're not the real   lightweights that people use for Rear Delts and  they're not super heavy like you would be using   for, let's say, an Overhead Press or Dumbbell  Press. We're not replacing the need for those   weights, we're complimenting them. And when you  do that, that's when the real magic happens.    Now, let's say I want to finish this off and I  want to get more of the front out here because   I can benefit from adding that in the same  weight will work in the drop set or let's   say a thirty second rest after the first set to  go right into something we call a Scoop Press.   And from the Scoop Press, I just get in this  position here, elbows down, locked in place,   ninety degrees. Scoop it underneath in press  down scoop, press here, scoop and press.   I'm not curling, just back, scoop and press. Good  stretch in the front at the bottom here, up the   elbows underneath, drive them up at the top.  And again, as long as you avoid   bringing them out in front of your body here,  you'll get away from that internal rotation,   upright row position and more to that extra  rotation, almost high pole position.
