        "text": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com. I'm  going to make you feel amazing, literally in just   minutes here. And I want you to do this every day  within 10 minutes of waking up. Now, the reason   why I say 10 minutes is because I know things get  in the way and you're never going to do it. So,   if you get up and make it a habit to start right  away, you're going to feel great. The first thing   I want you to do is get down on the ground,  we're going to open up your hips, your legs,   and make everything feel incredible. Everybody  is tight when they get out of bed in some way,   shape, or form, you take your feet just like  this and you sit back down onto your heels. So,   in other words, I just got down to the ground, put  my feet together, toes together, and sit back. And   where you're going to feel this is right here deep  into the groin, right? Maybe a little bit into   the low back, a little bit into the shoulders,  but mostly trying to feel it right in through   the groin. You hold this for 30 seconds. Now in  one smooth flow, get straight up like this into   that downward dog. Now people get lazy with the  downward dog, they keep their toes down, but their   heels off the ground, that's not good. Drive the  heels into the ground right away. You're going to   feel it from the very bottom of your heel, all the  way up through your hamstring and into your hips.   Right? So if I drive my heels down, I might  have to come up a little higher to get there,   but that's okay, and then I'm going to just try  to reach my head up a little bit, Look up.   Just by looking up, it starts to drive you down  a little bit more into anterior pelvic tilt that   really lights up your hamstrings. So, 30 seconds  here. Now we come down just a little bit and   this is called the Step Through. This is crazy.  You step through with your legs straight at the   knee and you let the outside of your footrest  on the ground. What you're going to feel here   is this intense stretch on the outside of your  lower leg. This is the peroneal, you feel this,   this is an area that we never, ever touch. And all  I want you to do when you're in this position here   is just slide your upper body a little bit in  this direction. So, when I'm in that stretch,   a little bit of a stretch in that direction,  just like that. Okay, When I'm done with that,   I take the other leg straight through again,  sink down a little bit, make sure the leg here,   this knee is straight on the outside of that foot,  the whole thing laying on the outside. And then   when I'm in this position, just slide a little  bit in the direction of the foot, just like that,   30 seconds. We're almost there, almost  done. Then what we do is we come back   to center again and just bring one leg up  just like this and sit down into it. Now,   here you're trying to get like a 90-degree  angle here at your knee and here at your hip.   And what you'll find is that you get this really  deep stretch in the outside of your hip.   And this is an area that we don't stretch often  enough. We need to get these muscles loose. These   are what lock the hip up and prevent you from  feeling loose enough. It's really what makes   you feel -- sometimes it causes a lot of low  back pain when these aren't loose enough. And   then from here, all I'm going to do is let myself  get a lot higher and then drop down. So now I've   just shifted the focus to the other hip right in  here through the hip flexor, just like that. So,   I came, I was down on this side, I come up to the  center, you can even lift an arm up if you can to   stretch out your lower abs. But what I've got now  is this intense stretch right here through the hip   flexor. Obviously, I switch up those legs again,  this side, now I'm working the hips this way.   Again, try to get that 90/90. And  when I'm done with that stretch there,   then what I'm going to do is again, come up nice  and tall, get that stretch all the way down here   into the hip flexor. Remember guys, within 10  minutes of waking up because I don't want you to   forget. Too easy for things to get in the way.  Get down here. Do this four simple stretches,   you'll be done in four minutes. All right,  guys. I hope you feel better, I know you will.   If you're looking for full programs, we got  them over at Athleanx.com.
