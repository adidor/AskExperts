        "text": "workouts might cause you to quit so the way this workout works is going to alternate those bottom up movements that are going to involve the weight of the legs the more challenging of them with the less challenging we call them hip flexor relief lower ab movements and we do this in a way that actually accommodates the different levels of ability if you're a beginner you perform those bottom up movements for 15 seconds and you rest 15 seconds before moving on to the next exercise if you're intermediate you perform them for 20 seconds with a 10 second rest and if you're more advanced you perform them for 25 seconds with a 5 second rest now the hip flexor relief movement is going to again remove the weight of the legs all you're going to try to do is isolate the pelvis and move it and not worry about having the legs be the factor that weights you down or makes you fatigue too early so because these are slightly easier we're all going to aim to perform these for 25 seconds with a 5 second rest if at some point you feel like you're getting fatigued here you can take a quick rest and try to get back into it but the fact is you go for as long as you can in that 25 seconds as far as a specific exercise sequence we start here with the figure eight and what we're trying to do here is not just get that pelvis lifted off of the ground but we're actually including some bottom-up rotation so you get some of the obliques working with the lower abs to drive the movement we move on to that first hip flexor relief exercise which here is called the lower abs swipe and what's cool about this movement is you're trying to reinforce the fact that",
