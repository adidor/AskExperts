        "text": "problems with that I did when it came out who knows that this is the only thing that he's doing do we know that he's not also doing full range of motion squats do we also know that there's a benefit particularly for basketball players to do this version of the exercise if you didn't know that there's actually a study that shows it I think guys know I don't usually get too wrapped up with what pubmed says relying more on experience but this particular study is one worth looking into well don't worry I don't to play boring elevator music to try to keep you interested in this 2016 study they took highly trained athletes LeBron James and they're looking for their improvement in vertical jump or 40 yards sprint running and basically what they determine was by squatting a different depth either full squat training half squat training or quarter squat training the one that had the greatest benefit in vertical jump games as you can see significantly higher than everywhere else was the quarter squat and also the biggest decreases and their 40-yard dash time also came from the quarter squat so what would cause this mostly it's the specificity of the joint angle that you're training at obviously if you're gonna jump you don't have to go all the way down to a full squat in order to do that or if you're gonna run you don't have to run all the way down from a fully flexed hip the specificity of the quarter squat as it relates to these two activities it's likely what led to those big gains so now if I've convinced you that there's actually at least Cerreta benefit to the exercise there's three rules that you and I have to go over here to make sure you're doing this right first up never do this that's not called the quarter squat that is called a knee trasher all the excessive strain and stress put on your patellar tendons and the anterior force and shear that's being put on the knees",

        "text": "in this position is horrible and should never be done if you want to do the quarter squat right you got to do what you'd normally do on a squat and that is get your hips involved as well hinge from the hips bend at the knees that is how you properly execute a quarter squat the second thing is let's be very clear you do not get to claim PRS for quarter squats those are reserved for full deep squats and thirdly if you're going to do this exercise you'd better be willing to load it properly you're performing this in the strongest range of motion of the squat which means you'd better be willing to load it more so than you would during a regular squat but then I mentioned the beginning in the video though about this other variation of the quarter squat you know the one that is gonna leave you in a heap down here on the floor like Jesse will be momentarily and that's what you do the quarter squats not from up here but from down there like all the way down so proper depth and then up just a little way and then back down again that up just a little bit and then back down are you feeling Jesse these provide a unique stimulus that you probably haven't felt before and the benefit here is not just getting you to reinforce proper depth but training you in your weaker range what are you doing so you're not only getting to experience that full depth and then learning how to sort of savor in it but you're also getting the additional benefits of experience in the stretch reflex to stretch portion of the range of motion of the squat and also learning how to initiate from the bottom of the squat learning that movement of the chest with the hips together is going to provide you with the best opportunity to get out of the hole explosively and then finally you also get a chance to feel the proper tracking of the knees especially in this bottom doubt position of the squat where you'll probably be",
