        "text": "So you got some low back pain they want  to fix? Well, do me a favor and break out   a notepad and a pen and then drop them on the  floor. I promise you, it's going to work.    What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, athleanx.com. So  what happened? Did you actually bend over and pick   it up or is it still on the floor? Well, I will  break out my muscle marker because this is a kind   of pen that I use and I'll drop it right here  on the floor and I'm going to pick it up. But   I want you to notice the difference here. When  you did yours, did you look like this when you   picked it up? Or did you look like this when we  picked it up? Now, if you didn't even notice the   difference there that's a little bit scary. But  you know what, you're in the right spot here,   I'm going to take care of you in this video.  Everyone knows who's ever had to deal with back   pain or maybe they're dealing with back pain right  now, whether it's disc related or muscle spasms   in your low back, is a little bit uncomfortable  to be bending forward to do anything. However,   I'm telling you right now, bending forward and  learning how to do it the right way is going to   be the key to unlocking your long-term permanent  solution to your back pain. So that being said,   instead of drawing all over myself with a muscle  marker in this video to help you fix your problem,   I'm going to take it to the next level, I'll  meet you over at the board, the telestrator.   That's now. Before we look at shirtless Jeff  here, let's take a look back at shirted Jeff   in these two versions of the pickup. So if you  look at them side by side now, it should become   very apparent very quickly what the difference  was. In one of them I was just simply bending   forward at the waist and picking up what's on the  floor. And in the other one, I'm doing something   a little bit prettier. Or at least it looks  biomechanically prettier because I'm actually   doing the direct opposite. The low back is maybe  what's sticking out to you. It's flexing forward   in this one here and it's actually just staying  straight and this one here. But that's not really   what's happening. Look below that at the hips. At  the hips, I'm simply flexing forward or allowing   gravity to flex me forward in this one. But I'm  hinging backwards in the other one. And that's the   key. You need to learn the proper biomechanics  of your hip joint in order to get your back   in the right position to perform time, over time,  over time without becoming injured. So what better   way to learn how to do this properly than with  an exercise that we can all do? This is an RDL,   you don't have to have a heavy weight to do this,  but having a bar in your hand or even a dowel   will allow you to feel what I'm talking about,  because the biofeedback you get from the bar   riding up and down your legs is going to make  you know that you're in the right position.   So we have a comparison here, an improperly  performed one in a properly performed. Let's   start with the properly performed one. You can see  here that the initiation of getting that bar down   to the floor had nothing to do with me bending  at the waist, bending forward. It has everything   to do with right there the hips traveling back  in this direction. What I want you to focus on   is making sure it goes straight back and forth.  If you imagine that there's a dresser behind you   with a drawer that's been left open, you want to  be able to allow your butt to close that drawer.   Right. It's one of the best analogies out there  gets you to realize that is simply just a straight   back and forth motion that drives your ability  to get down lower to the ground. Most of us think   that to get low, we have to get our head lower  to the ground because that's where our eyes are.   Really, what we need to do is just simply get the  hips back and that will bring the head with it.   So if we watch what this does, we see that getting  the butt straight back, yes, it closes that drawer   and it gets me all the way down to the ground.  Now, the bar travel, what's going on there? Unlike   what's happening over here, the bar is going to  stay directly in contact with my legs and you see   all the way down, all the way down past the knees,  the knees don't have to bend very much to get out   of the way, they stay right there. The bar has  traveled straight up and down. Okay, now what's   driving the bar back up? The same thing that  got it down to the ground you're going to now,   instead of bringing the hips backwards, you're  going to bring the hips forward and you'll see   that that will bring that bar straight up again,  straight up by letting the butt come this way.    Now, what's improper? What's improper  is allowing this to bend forward.   Why does that cause back pain? Just like when you  did the incorrect version, we bent over to pick up",

        "text": "the pen. Well, two things happen. Number one,  you're putting way too much stress on the low   back muscles because the glutes don't want to do  their job. Right there, look it, there hasn't been   any real posterior motion here of the hips. It's  all occurring by leaning forward with the back.   When that happens, we get the muscles of the  low back that act like the reins on a horse.   As the horse starts to get in front of you,  you want to pull back to control the horse,   well the same things happening here. As that  weight starts to get down or worse, as you'll   see here out in front of you, the low back  muscles are saying, hold on and they're trying   to grab netcentric hold on to pull you back. Well, at some point they're going to be overtaxed.   They're going to come to a point where they're  just over fatigued and they say that's enough.   They become strained. You have a spasm, whatever  it is, but you get a lot of discomfort. It might   be a position you find yourself in right now. The  fact is it's not that one time that caused it,   though it's what you felt was the leading cause of  it. It's what led to that over the period of many,   many, many, many days, weeks and months is that  doing the improper mechanics on the forward bend   is what caused that to become fatigued to the  point where it gives out on that one single time.   So understand that we want to fix this, fix  it every single time you pick something up,   not just with a barbell in your hand, but we are  picking something off the floor. So if I go back   here and I let it play out, if I let that bar  drift, that's just increased that moment arm and   causing more strain on those low back muscles to  have to do more work to control that weight as it   drifts out longer, longer away from my hips.  So the fact is, guys, you have to learn how to   do this properly, dragging that bar straight up  and down is a good feedback to know that you're   doing this right. But most importantly, it's  the motion simply back and forth of the hips   that drives proper hip extension and that gets  you in position to do this right every single time   and saves you back in the process.  So there you have it, guys, with the   remedial task of simply learning how to bend  forward and maybe even tie your shoelaces,   you've now learned how to bulletproof your back  to preventing back pain in the future. Guys,   listen, it's all about learning how to create a  formidable body, not just a strong one, but one   that is resilient to injury in the long run.
