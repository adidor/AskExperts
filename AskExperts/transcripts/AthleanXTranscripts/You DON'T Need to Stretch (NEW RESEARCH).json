        "text": "about to do that for you because I'm going to help you to modify the exercises that you're already doing in your workouts to make them much more effective at increasing range of motion and flexibility and it starts right here with the basic exercise like the lat pull down when it comes to the lap pull down what you would do is incorporate a deliberate stretching set perform about five or six repetitions exaggerating the end points to maximize that stretch on the lats and get that full contraction on the way back and as you notice there I actually dropped the weight quite significantly here because it has nothing to do with the weight as long as there's enough there to create that loaded tension that we're looking for and as I get to that end range I'm just going to hold that sink into the stretch and allow it to open up my shoulders and back and increase the overall length of those lats over time overall you're looking for about five or six repetitions with accumulation of about 30 seconds of stretch on this exercise now each of these five to six repetitions will be held for about five seconds in that stretch position so you're basically accumulating is about 30 seconds of total stretch and this is actually nice because it sort of overlaps with one of my good friend Andrew huberman's recommendation of how much stretching is actually required to cause a formative change that being said the other nice thing about this protocol is that it doesn't conflict with what we already know could happen with static stretching performed before an exercise we know that that can sometimes limit or attenuate the output of strength and force generation if you do it right before a workout well this is acting more like a dynamic stretch because you're only holding each one of them for those five seconds you're kind of moving through those repetitions so it could actually be performed as a final set of",
