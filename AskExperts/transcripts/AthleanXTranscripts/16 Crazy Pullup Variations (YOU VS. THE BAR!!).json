The pull up is no doubt one of the best upper body exercises you can do, regardless of whether you have access to a bunch of bars and dumbbells. The thing is, some people find it very, very challenging. Don't give up on the exercise. You see, there's a lot of ways that you can actually make this thing easier. You take one of these resistance bands – this is one that we have, our Extreme Band – and this will help weight your bodyweight by about 60lbs to 80lbs. The black one here; about 30lbs to 40lbs. So you can start doing them assisted and build up your tolerance to be able to do more. That being said, one of the hallmarks of our Athlean-X training system is, guys that do it could really start cranking out pull ups. Even if they couldn’t do one when they started, by the end of it they're not just doing pull ups. They're in need of more complicated, more complex, and more challenging versions. Today I've put together an arsenal of pull up variations for you to challenge you no matter what level you're at. I want you to see them all right now. Remember, beginner, advanced; we've got a pull up here for you. Find the one that challenges you the most and start banging them out. So there you have it. There are plenty of pull up variations there to keep you not only busy, but challenged. If you want to change yourself you're going to want to have to challenge yourself at every opportunity. This will surely get the job done. Like I said, even if you can't do one start where you can and use your assisted band, build up your tolerance, and if you follow our Athlean-X training systems I promise you, you will not only get good at pull ups, you'll be able to start cranking out much more difficult variations and keep that muscle growth coming and keep that exercise challenging for you ever step of the way. I'll see you guys over at AthleanX.com. You can get our program over there. In the meantime, leave your comments and thumbs up below and let me know what you want to see and I'll do my best here to bring it to you in the days and weeks ahead. See you later.",
