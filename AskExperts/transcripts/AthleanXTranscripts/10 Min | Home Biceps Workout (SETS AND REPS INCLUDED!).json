        "text": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere. Athleanx.com.  If you've got ten minutes then you've got plenty   of time to get this bicep workout in. You see,  I'm going to give you two options that you cold   do either at home or at the gym that are going to  destroy your biceps in ten minutes flat. You see,   I talk about it all the time, you can either  train hard or you can train long but you can't   do both. If we train in some of that workout  length that maybe you're accustomed to for a lot   more intensity, you're going to feel first-hand  exactly why it's possible to build muscle in a   short period of time. So with that being said,  let's start breaking down the lighter version   of the workout, and by no means does that mean  easier. All right, so when we're talking about a   lighter workout here, remember, first of all this  is relative. It doesn't mean necessarily light,   it means lighter than the heavier version of the  workout we're going to show you later. And vice   versa when we're talking about the heavier one,  it doesn't mean absolutely heavy where we would   actually be training for strength if we got to  the low rep ranges with more rest time. We're   talking about heavier than the lighter workout.  Both of them, however, are geared at hypertrophy   and muscle growth. And right here when we  target the biceps, one of the best ways to   do it was with a single band. Now I know what  you're saying, band workouts are easy, maybe,   until you try this one. The fact is we're going to  start here with a single exercise and you're going   to perform it for 45 seconds on and 15 seconds  off. Now the goal would be to be able to perform   it nonstop without resting through the duration  of the 45 seconds. If you had to stop, you stop   briefly, and you get right back into it again and  you keep going. Because what we're trying to do   here is go after a metabolic fatigue. We're trying  to use metabolic stimulus as a way to create   muscle growth. And if we keep pushing ourselves  through that burn we're going to get there faster.   But we don't just have one exercise here, we  take that first exercise for 45 on and 15 off,   and we repeat it for a total of two times. That  means two minutes for the first exercise. We then   go and we repeat four other exercises in the same  fashion. So what do the exercises look like? Well,   we start with this one here and this is a no money  banded curl. And what the advantage is the band   supply here, well it's not just the fact that  we can resist ourselves through flection of the   elbow through the curl itself, but we can also  pull apart. And you can see as we pull the band   apart we're getting resisted external rotation.  So we're not just getting biceps focused here,   we're getting biceps with external rotation  in the rotator cuff. Which is actually an   extremely powerful combo when you realize that  the biceps tend to be an integral part of the   shoulder joint itself gets additional benefit  from having the balance of the rotator cuff to   keep that shoulder in good health. 45 seconds  on, 15 seconds off, two rounds. From here we   move on to the second exercise, and now this is  the banded drag curl. We shorten the moment arm,   we bring the elbows back, we take our  hands, we bring them closer to our body,   and we curl from this position, which shifts the  focus actually to the long head of the bicep,   the outside portion, which is what's responsible  more for that bicep's peak. And you could see I'm   just trying to drag my hands up my torso as much  as I can, allowing the elbow bend, the flection   part that attacks the biceps to happen mostly  back behind my body. You should feel a tight   contraction as you get as high as you possibly  can. From here you lower the band back down,   repeat, again 45 seconds on, and 15 seconds  off. We next move on to the third exercise here,   which is called the step back curl. And for this,  all I have to do is anchor the band to anything   that's a little bit higher than me. Ideally, if  you have a pull-up bar in your doorway, this would   work perfectly. With the band anchored in place,  I grab onto it, I step back to get good tension,   and I curl. But I'm not done yet. From here now  I have to take a giant step backwards. And what   that does is it places an additional isometric  overload to maintain that elbow flection in that   position through the duration of the step back  when I'm getting more tension here on the band,   and then come back in and repeat it again. Now the  extra benefit here is the fact that I'm getting my   biceps into a state of complete contraction. I've  got elbow flection, I've got supination, and I've   got that all important third component that we  oftentimes overlook, which is shoulder flection.   So this set-up sets us into the position for  having that complete bicep contraction. Remember,",

        "text": "45 seconds on, 15 seconds off. Again, two rounds  of this. We move on to the fourth exercise here   in the workout, and this is the cross body banded  hammer curl. So the slight positioning difference   here is instead of being in the neutral position  that you would normally perform a hammer curl out   of, we go into a fully pronated position. And  we know that if we go into a pronated position,   we actually activate the brachialis a little bit  more than if we do it from that mid-position. Now,   why is that a benefit? Well, there's two reasons.  Number one: we know that the brachialis is the   muscle that we want to develop if we want  to have a fully developed upper arm as it   lies underneath the biceps. But more importantly,  think about where this is in this workout. This   is the fourth exercise in. You're already likely  burning and cursing my name out. We got to offset   that bicep load a little bit and give it a little  bit of a break. At a key moment in the workout,   and this is why this is placed in here perfectly  at this time. Remember, as always, once again,   the 45 on, 15 off, two rounds. And then we wrap up  our workout here in this final two minute stretch.   This one reserved for the leaning stretch curl.  And to perform this you want to angle our body   forward with our biceps facing almost directly  down towards the ground. This is going to place   an enormous stretch in the biceps because we have  our arms here back into extension behind our body   as opposed to, remember we talked about, flection  of the shoulder. Now from here we want to try   to drive our hands down towards the ground and  straight forward. They should almost be facing   directly forward if you've done this properly.  At that point, you should feel a pretty intense   bicep contraction, but most importantly, you're  taking advantage of that stretch reflex. You have   an opportunity here to get a strong contraction  in the fifth spot of the workout because you had   the added stretch reflex that's going to be used  to your advantage. Make sure you take advantage   of it if you want to get through the remainder of  this workout. And with that, in just ten minutes,   you've managed to torture your biceps with a  single band, probably in the comfort of your   own home. And more importantly, you've convinced  yourself that good things can happen if you're   willing to put the work in. Let's say you want  to go the other route, you want to go a little   bit heavier, but you still just had those ten  minutes. Well, in that case, all you need is a   single pair of dumbbells, and you do this instead.  If the option you chose was to train a little   bit heavier, then the goal should be a little bit  different. The focus is not using metabolic stress   to drive hypertrophy muscle growth. The goal here  is to use tension overload as well as eccentric   overload to create that stimulus for growth. And  we could do that, like I said, with a single pair   of dumbbells. And in some cases, here in the last  exercise, a single one of those dumbbells from   that pair. But what we start with is the following  exercise, and it is the dumbbell straight bar   curl. So we're going to mimic a straight bar by  placing those dumbbells end to end like you see me   doing here. What that does, is it demands that we  move them at the same pace, which actually exposes   any muscle imbalances you might have between  the right and left side. But more importantly,   it just gets us into simulating the movement of  the bar, as opposed to two independent dumbbells,   which as you're going to see here in a minute, is  going to actually become a little bit easier for   you when we need it the most. You do this for a  minute. If we could get through the entire minute,   you've done your job. If you can't and you have  to rest, just like we did in the light version   of the workout, you would take a momentary rest  pause, get right back into it, and finish out the   entire minute. Now for these types of exercises,  however, because the load is higher we're going to   get a one minute rest period. So we've got a one  minute work period, one minute rest period. And   as you can see, the workout is structured with  additional exercises, all the way down until we   get towards the end, where I have a special  surprise. But that's not here yet. The next   exercise up is what we need to discuss, and that  is the dumbbell drag curl. So for the drag curl,   just like we did with the banded drag curl,  the goal is to try to hit the long head of the   biceps by bringing those dumbbells in closer to  your torso, getting the elbows back behind you,   and simply trying to ride those dumbbells up the  front of your body as tight as you possibly can.   You can see the contraction here on that outer  portion of the biceps. You can feel the intensity   of the contraction if you're doing it right.  The fact is, in the second spot here actually is",

        "text": "beneficial because it's offloading some of the  tension that was on the biceps from the first   exercise by the change in the moment arm to allow  you to continue to do this ideally without rest.   But this is only going to last you for a minute  because we're going right back to the curl again,   as you can see here in exercise number three,  this time to the dumbbell standing alternating   curl. So now how is this going to be possible if  we already fatigue the biceps through the first   two exercises? Well, the big difference here is  that you're able to move a lot more weight when   you move them individually than when you move  them together. And a lot of it has to do with   your ability to control your torso via your core  strength. When you move two dumbbells up together,   let's say they weigh 50 pounds apiece, your body's  trying to stabilize 100 pounds moving in this   direction. So you have to have a stronger core  contraction and more stability to do that. In the   case of a single alternating dumbbell curl, you're  only having to do half of that. Not to mention   you can actually lean into the arm and actually  create a little bit more leverage for the working   arm that makes this exercise possible, even though  it's put in that third spot. And we continue here,   again, after a two minute time period to go to our  fourth exercise, which is the cross body dumbbell   hammer curl. And once again, just like we did  in the banded version here, we're going fully   pronated to force that brachialis to do more of  the work. You can see that even as we crank out   rep after rep. It would feel like it would be  very difficult here. But we're not just relying   solely on the biceps. We have the help it needs  in the brachialis. We want to make sure that we   use it to get the job done. And this brings  us to the ninth minute of the workout here,   right when your biceps are ready to pop, we kind  of stick the final dagger into them with this   bicep waiter curl. And the water curl's job is to  actually take the forearms that probably want to   kick in at this point, and dominate the movement,  say no, you can't. You're going to stay out of   this thing and let the biceps finish this off.  So you get into this wrist extension position to   support the dumbbell where the top of the dumbbell  basically stays level with the ceiling that you're   curling in for the duration of the exercise.  Now this was only being done for 45 seconds,   but it doesn't make it any easier. Your goal is  to simply lift that dumbbell straight up to the   ceiling by getting those wrists taken out of it  to prevent the forearms from kicking in too much.   If we can make it through the entire 45 seconds  here, you get a brief 45 second rest before we   hit our last combination here, and this is our  burnout. I had mentioned this special surprise,   the goal here is to try to make it through the  entire minute without resting, or at least doing   some type of contraction. Because you got an  option here, you either start with holding this   isometric contraction in the midrange of the bicep  curl, which by the way, is the most difficult   portion of the curl. You hold it there as long as  you possibly can. Now at this point in the game,   it's likely you may not be able to hold it for  the entire time. But it doesn't mean that you   stop. You can actually try to force the eccentric  overload of this exercise, and that's being done   by just simply delaying and slowing down the  straightening out of your arms as they start   to become overcome by the weight of the dumbbells  in your hands. Don't let them just drop. Slow it   down with every bit of effort you have remaining.  If you make it through the end of the minute here,   it's a job well done, and believe me, you've  earned it. And once again, in ten minutes now,   you've got that workout here laid out in front  of you step-by-step with just that single pair   of dumbbells that's going to get the job done as  well. It doesn't matter which path you choose,   different stresses all leading to the same goal  of more bicep growth, more hypertrophy. Remember   guys, it doesn't mean that you have to train long  in order to get results. All you have to do is   be willing to train hard and you can train in a  lot of that workout length if you're willing to   up the intensity level at which you train with.  If you're looking for a program that encourages   that and shows you how to do it step-by-step, you  can head to Athleanx.com right now and find the   program that's best suited to your current goals.  In the meantime, if you found this video helpful,   if you like series, let me know below what  else you want to see.
