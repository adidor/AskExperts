        "text": "So, you want to build some impressive boulder  shoulders. You don't need to start lifting heavy   rocks, but you do need to start with a pair  of heavy dumbbells. And the first exercise   I'm recommending is a Dumbbell Seesaw Press. And  what we're doing here is, we re simply going to   alternate one arm driving up and the other arm  pulling down. And that's the key. I want you   to actively pull down with the one arm as you  press the other one up, because neurologically   we actually function as push pull machines so we  can get better output by pulling down while we're   trying to push up. The other thing that we see  here is a stacking of the wrist over the elbow,   over the shoulder by simply leaning a little bit  to one side while we press up. This would be very   helpful for those people that have a little bit  of discomfort with overhead pressing. Now you're   not locked into having to do the Seesaw Press, if  you prefer, you can do the Barbell Overhead Press   or you can do one of my favorites, The Landmine  Press, it doesn't matter which one you pick,   just start off with something heavy.  But now I know you were thinking, Jeff,   can I have the sets of reps, please? So, what you  do is four sets of this exercise. The first one,   you're going to choose a weight that you  could fail in the 8 to 10 rep range.   The second set, you're going to choose heavier  weight that allows you to fail in the 6 to 8 rep   range. And on the last two sets you're going  to keep that weight the same and work your   way towards getting those 6 to 8 reps again.  Even if you have to rest/pause your way to it.   But you're not done because here's where the fun  starts, because now you drop one of the dumbbells   and do an over and back where you're just going  to try to burn out those delts one more time   by heaving the dumbbell and using a little  bit of momentum from your legs if necessary.   If you're using the Barbell Overhead Press,  you're simply going to turn it into a Push Press   once you've reached fatigue. And if you did that  Landmine Press, you're going to use your legs once   again here to grind out those final grueling reps.  Now, of course, if you want bolder shoulders,   we're not stopping with one exercise. We need to  start focusing more on that middle delt and how we   can build it out. And my favorite way to do that  is with something called the Cable Side Lateral   Row. And here you take a cable, if you have  access to one, don't worry, I'll give you an   option if you don't. And we simply going  to pull our arm across our body and pull   out into abduction to hit that middle delt. Look at the stretch that we're getting on the   middle delt and the rear delt in the beginning  position, because I can cross my arm all the   way across the front of my body. That gives us  the chance to recruit these muscle fibers more   effectively because of that stretch preceding  every rep. But I mentioned maybe you don't   have access to this machine. No problem. All you  have to do is this Side Lying Lateral Raise. And   by just simply laying yourself on the bench  like this, you're having your arm drop down   into that pre stretch position, giving you the  same benefits without necessarily the equipment   requirements. As far as sets and reps here,  you're talking about three sets of 8 to 10   on each arm. No need to rest in between, as you're  working one arm, you're wrestling the other.   Keep the flow going here, guys, to keep the gains  coming. But that round fullness characteristic of   a boulder shoulder isn't limited just to the  middle delt. If you look at me from the side,   it's also going to grow in this direction too.  And for that we've got to make sure we hit the   rear delt too. And I like to do something called  the Hip Hugger. The idea would be focusing on what   the elbows are doing, they need to move out to  the side and back behind you at the same time.   I don't want you to turn this into a shrug,  and if you do that and don't think about just   lifting the dumbbells up, just rather take them  along for the ride, you're going to nail this   exercise every time. Squeeze every single  rep at the top, increase the weight here,   three sets of 6 to 8 reps that will get the job  done. Did somebody say rear delts? Might as well   just said Face Pulls because you knew we weren't  going to make it through a full shoulder workout   without including my favorite exercise. And here  what I'm looking for is stimulation of the rear   delts. Of course, we're going to hit the upper  back too, because this exercise is just so damn   versatile. But I want you to get those elbows back  behind your body. A lot of people do this wrong,   they leave the elbows out in front of them.  Get them at least to the level of your body",

And this exercise is always going to be  an amazing exercise for rounding out the back part   of that shoulder of yours. Now, when it comes to  rounding out those boulders, more of us have less   of a problem doing it with our front delt. The  development usually comes a lot easier because   of the other exercises we do, but it doesn't  mean you have to avoid them entirely.   So, what we do here is one of my  favorite exercises and it's just   a Stretch Front Raise. And all we're doing here,  guys, is applying the same principle we did before   with putting that pre-stretch on the muscle  that we want to grow. We can elicit a stronger   contraction just by dropping those arms down,  which naturally puts them into extension because   of the angle of the incline bench. If you don't  have access to this or you want an alternative,   you could do this with the cables and what we call  a Cable Stretch Front Raise. That stretch being   applied to the front delt is going to help with  the recruitment of those type two fibers which   are most capable of growth and creating that  full boulder shoulder that you're looking for.   Once again, you're looking for three sets of 8 to  10 reps for maximum shoulder development and to   cap off this workout. And yes, pun intended. And  because I always look to hook up my subscribers,   if you're looking for this workout, you don't  feel like writing it down. You can have it over   at athleanx.com/boulders. If you're looking  for more workouts, you check out these two   shoulder workouts and make sure you subscribe  guys. I'll be back here next week. See you.",
