        "text": "So, if I can show you something super  simple that you could do every single   day to build not just stronger glutes  but better-looking ones, and also,   we could correct a lot of disfunction from  the inside out, that leads to a lot of hip,   a little back pain. Would you be  interested? You bet your ass I would.   What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Altheanx.com.  I want to help you with your glutes today   because I know how important it is to  develop them, not just for how they look,   but how they function. And what I'm going to talk  about here is actually not the glute max, because   this is the muscle that you might be focusing  on or you might have paid a lot of attention to   and for good reason, because when it's developed,  it has a certain look, let's just put it that way.   But I'm talking about the muscle underneath. It's  the Glute Medius. It's the one that doesn't really   get lumped in too much when we talk about the  glutes. And if you're doing that, you're making   a big mistake. So, I'm going to show you this for  simple moves. You're all going to have to do two   of them, either two, on the ground or two here and  standing that everyone is going to be able to do   no matter what your ability level is, and you're  not going to need any equipment at all to do them.   So that being said, let's meet me on the  ground, I'll show you exactly what to do.   So, as I said, the Glute Medius is where  we're going to put all of our focus, because   if you're lunging, squatting, dead lifting or leg  pressing right now, you're hitting your glute max,   I promise you, you are. But what we are  missing is the frontal plane abduction that   we get from the glute medius and the rotary  component that we get from the glute medius,   that we just don't get from the glute max, or  as well as we get from the glute medius. So,   what we do is we get down here on the floor  and all I'm going to have to do is get in   your side like this. These are really simple. And  again, you could do these every single day.    You get down here and the first thing we do is we  realize that when the leg is in front of the body,   here, that we want to have internal rotation if we  want to get the glute medius. So that means take   your toe and try to stab it into the ground,  okay. Get it about 30 or so degrees in front   of your body and try to point your toe straight  down into the ground. From here, all you're doing   is keeping a nice, stable upper body and you're  going to lift your leg up as high as you can into   abduction at the hip. You should feel it light up  right here in this area of your leg, that's when   you know you're getting the glute medius. And all  I'm going to do is come up and create every single   contraction as a very purposeful, meaningful one.  I don't care--I'm not looking for this, it's not   a race. I'm looking for good quality contractions,  as many as you can until you can't stand the burn   anymore. And if you've ever heard the term  \"light your ass up\" this is actually where   it started right here. So, you do that now.  Now, once you're done with that, we've got to   get the back side here in a different angle.  And that's when we put our hip into extension   behind the body. When it's back here, now, what we  want is extra rotation at the hip. So instead of   pointing the toe down, we point it up towards  the ceiling. But because I'm falling this way   when that happens, if I lift my leg up and  probably get more hip flexor instead of the   abduction I'm looking for. So, what I want you to  do is just lay a little bit more like this, okay?   Lay flatter to the ground, leg goes  back behind midline of the body here,   turn the toe up and now lift up. Oh my God, right  up to the sky. See, I can't do a lot of these   and neither will you. But it doesn't matter,  it's the good quality contractions that count.   So we do as many as we can, once a day is fine for  me. You're going to accumulate better activation   of these muscles just by doing these routinely  and regularly, and that's going to pay big   dividends in the long run. I'm going to show you  now what you can do in standing as an alternative   if you don't want to do these laying down. Let's say you're at work and you don't want to   lay on the floor, do your exercises. It doesn't  give you a reason to get out of doing them for the   day. Again, you can do this really, really simply.  The standing version is an alternative. I will   tell you this, the standing version is actually  maybe a slightly better alternative. Because   any time you can get in a weight bearing situation  in a closed chain feet on the ground situation,   I like the activation better that you get through  the muscles of the hip and low back and glutes",

        "text": "by doing it this way. So, what we  do is we try to create the same   idea as what we had down there on the ground. But  the benefit is we get two legs working at once.   So, we get in this position and I square off  in front of the bar and all I'm going to do is   take my leg, keep it in front of my body, this is  midline right here. Keep it in front of my body,   turn the toe in. And then I'm going to do is going  to bring it out to the side into that abduction   again, like a leg swing. But what happens is, as  I swing this up, this hip on this side comes over.   So, I let it drop and then I let it come over, I  let it drop and I let it come over. So, what you   see is a leg coming towards you, but I've dropped  the hip out and now I swing it in front and over,   out and over. So, this leg thing in front  toes pointing down as much as I can.   And what it does is, it works this side through  that flexion, abduction, internal rotation,   and it works this side through that sliding  hip over. You'll feel it both ways. Now   I will hit that backside to where we bring our  leg back behind the body. In this case, we angle   towards this wall here at about 45 degrees. Then  what I do is, I'm going to take the leg from right   about right behind my heel, I'm turning it out to  the side here so my toe is pointed out this time   instead of pointing in. I'm still going to try  to create this, but what I do is I turn my body   towards the wall or the post or  whatever you're holding on to so,   I'm getting rotation through here. I come out, I  rotate and I'm kicking my leg up just like that.   Rotate, kick it up towards the ceiling as long  as this leg stays back behind this midline here,   then I've got it in the same position  as it was on the ground. Turn   and kick up and again, quality repetitions, I feel  this hip squeezing, I feel this hip squeezing,   both glute medius working together. So  that rotation just to open it all up.   Either way, guys, maybe you'll have a hard time  initially feeling these muscles contract because   the mind muscle connection is so dormant  because you haven't done anything for a   long period of time. In that case, I like the  ones laying down on the ground because you get   that instant connection. Once you've got that no  transition to standing for that extra benefit.    So there you have it guys, two exercises,  you're choice which ones you pick.   They're going to help you to build that all  important and overlooked glute medius to get   you on the right track. If you're looking  for programs guys, we have a whole--   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,  holy smokes, Jeff, that really   lit my ass up. I feel like I'm on fire. That's because you actually are, Jesse.   Oh, oh, oh! Stop, drop and roll, buddy,  it works every time, I promise.   Speaking of working guys, if you're  looking for programs that work,   we have them all laid out for you step by  step over at Athleanx.com.
