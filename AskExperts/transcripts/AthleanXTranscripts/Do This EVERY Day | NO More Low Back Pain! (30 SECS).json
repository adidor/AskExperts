        "text": "that instead what we want to do is make sure that the low back itself is strong and stable but guess what happens if the hips aren't strong or the muscles around the hips the glutes aren't strong then the low back tries to do the work of that and that's a problem so let me show you what i do this is kind of funny that's what i want you to start doing every day and i say every day because this is something i've done every day and didn't even realize it until jesse pointed it out what i do is we'll be talking about a video we're going to do like hey jesse what do we want to cover next when's that great intro of yours coming out you know what by the way when is that great intro of yours coming out uh 2020 2020. see this is ridiculous drag so i'll come over here and i'll do this as we speak you know i just kind of like not even thinking about it knock off about 10 or 12 high quality repetitions and i stopped and just like what what are you what did you say what are you doing i asked are you being fidgety right now i see you do this that was a nervous tic i don't always do it here in the gym the beauty about this exercise this is a reverse hyperextension the reverse hyperextension can be done anywhere it can be done there it can be done here on a bench like this straight down hold onto the bench and lift up into full extension driving from the glutes i'll talk about that in a second it can be done on the edge of a bed like i do the reason why i use it and why i encourage you to use it every day is because you need to get a stronger low back those muscles are not strong enough posturally we put them through a beating you need to get stronger low back but it has to be driven from below because what we need to do is drive strength from the bottom",
