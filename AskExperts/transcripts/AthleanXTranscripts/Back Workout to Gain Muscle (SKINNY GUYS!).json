        "text": "Go ahead, hot shot. Oh, I'm back, baby. Run  it. Jesse. Ooh. Jesse. Are you serious? Oh,   I'm dead serious. That's the best one  yet. Look, guys, it's Jeff Cavaliere,   Athleanx.com. And he is back. Anybody that was  worried out there that he was actually gone, no,   Jesse's still here. And by the way, who filmed  that last video? My replacement. Oh my God. You   got to keep the head in the frame. Oh, yeah, I  know, you missed me. I'm actually glad Jesse's   back. But it's actually more than just Jesse  being back. Today we're talking about Jesse's   back. Right, we're talking about from a hard  gainer perspective, a skinny guy, what can you do   to build your back? Because I think what happens a  lot of times with skinnier guys is that they don't   oftentimes focus on building it back. The first  thing they do is they try to focus on what they   see in the mirror-- bigger chest, bigger biceps,  whatever it is, and they're not really focusing on   building a bigger back. But we know how important  a bigger back is, especially when we talk about   what Jesse was dealing with. And that was Postural  issues. Bad postural issues, right? Really like   that. And a lot of times, people will develop  that if you're a skinnier guy because if you're   self-conscious at all, and you sort of adopt this  posture, right? A lot of insecurities. Like Jesse,   you could see him right here, in the three sets  of 12 video. Staring right into your soul. And   staring into the soul. Now he's overconfident,  which is why he got thrown into the quantum realm   in the first place. No, for real, he's actually  built confidence as he's built the back. Right,   so what I want to do is go through what you do to  build your back. Right. Right, specifically what   are you doing? So, in a particular workout, either  whether you're doing a bro split, whether you're   doing a push-pull leg split, which is really more  often what you're doing, what's your mindset when   you do your back training? So, my mindset is that  I always have a stable exercise, and that's the   dead lift. I always dead lift no matter what  kind of back day I'm doing whether it's a pull   or whether it is a straight back or whatever. I  find that it's great for increasing strength and   it's also, again, allowed me to work on my posture  and it strengthens my lower back, which is really   important because, as you know. Yeah, he had a  weak low back, which I think was actually some   of the root of his problems, starting down low,  carrying right up the kinetic chain. Yeah. So,   all right, so the dead lift staple of the workout.  Next thing you got a choice, right? Yes, there's   always a choice on this one. I either like to  do a bar bell row or a seated cable row. So for   a horizontal pulling movement, working more on  that depth, right? The front to back thickness   here. Yes. Is more of that row. So now the seated  row. Seated row I love because it allowed me to   get into that stretch because as we have the cable  down lower it allows me to get into that stretch   and really feel it in my lats. But when I pull  back, not only do I feel it in my upper back,   but I feel it in my rear delts as well, which I  think is really important because that's a muscle   that's often overlooked. Yeah, so you could see  with that low cable set up like Jesse referred to,   it brings your arms out in front of your body,  separating the attachments of the lat so you get   a better stretch, which allows you to get a more  powerful contraction on every single rep, but it's   just a good way to do the seated row. Yeah. Okay,  as opposed to just doing it at the same level   of your hands. Right, get them out a little bit  lower than you. If you don't do the seated row,   what do you do instead? I do the bar bell row.  Okay. So I like the bar bell row. Obviously,   it's another staple kind of classic exercise  for your back. But I like that it reinforces   the strength of the lower back because you have  to sit back. And with a weak low back you're not   going to be able to handle that position really  well while you're pulling the weight up. So I   talked about when it comes to the bar bell row,  how important it is to actually as an exercise to   learn the hinge. Yeah. Right, because if you  hinge properly, then you're going to be able   to carry that bar bell in the right position to  bring it up towards your chest without being too   far in front of you. Because when the bar bell  gets out in front of you, that's when it starts   to put extra strain on your low back. But if you  can learn how to hinge and sit back into that row,   that's when you actually start to see the proper  mechanics pay off in terms of being able to do the   exercise without any of the negative side effects.  Correct. And again, I like to alternate when I'm   doing these. I don't do them on the same day. I  like to alternate. Right, it's one or the other",

        "text": "there. Yeah, it's one or the other, and then I go  back and forth. Thirdly now, you went horizontal,   now you're working vertical. So you have a choice  there too. Another stable exercise is the pull-up,   obviously. It's always great to be pulling your  own body weight up. But, the other choice is a   lat pull down, but not just any lat pull down,  it's the rocking lat pull down that you taught   me a long time ago you showed on this channel.  Where I thought when I was doing lat pull downs   originally, I felt like I was pulling a lot with  my forearms, a lot with my biceps. Allowing my   lats to really take over on that movement I think  has made a whole bunch of difference in the size   of my lats and the width of them as well as just  getting that mind-muscle connection. You have   to actually use the muscle it is that you're  trying to grow. And I say that a lot of times,   if you focus on initiating the move with the  muscle you're trying to grow, you'll actually be   surprised at how much you can make it grow. And  with Jesse, again, he mentions sort of pulling   more from here, pulling with his forearms, pulling  with his biceps, not necessarily pulling with his   back. Then when you do that rotational pull down  here, down in one side, you're actually able to   get an elbow not just inducted, which is one of  the main functions of the lats, but you can get   it back behind your body into more extension,  which is going to allow a lot of the people out   there that can't feel this mind-muscle connection  to feel a lot better. All right, so that covers   the vertical, the horizontal, your main staple  exercise. This is the part where I think things   start to fall off the rails for a lot of people  and instead they don't focus on the correctives.   Right. And in Jesse's case, when it was a postural  imbalance that was sort of setting off the whole   cascade of negative side effects about with all of  his lifting, that was a staple exercise too. And   those actually all are done in every time that  you're training. Every single time I train. So the   first one up is the carry. Carry, I like to grab  a pair of heavy dumb bells, sometimes a trap bar,   sometimes kettle bells. And, honestly, even plates  when I'm moving them to and from the bar. I just   try to get as many carries in and I take a couple  laps around the gym because I know it's good for   my grip, but it's also even better for my upper  traps. And something you've been actually doing   all the time now almost every day. Yes. And  honestly, I mean, definitely starting to pay off   more in the overall thickness of your upper torso  here. So carries, that's upper traps. Yup. Lower   traps. Lower traps is always that plate raise.  I like getting the overhead and then tilting   it forward. It's almost like peeking through the  window. I think that's been great for lighting up   my low traps and just made me a little bit more  strong in the rest of my lifts. So lower traps,   for those of you who haven't been doing enough  lower trap work, crucial for establishing good   posture and good biomechanics of the shoulder  whenever your arm goes up overhead. So the trap   raised does that and you can see the lower traps.  Remember, they're a kite-shaped muscle, guys. So   we're not just working on the top part here, but  you got to work on the lower part here, too. And   again, the benefits that they provide in terms  of the structural integrity and stability of your   shoulder are so important that you can't overlook  them. So the trap raise is what Jesse uses. Then   you have one last one here to focus on your low  back, because again, some of your root issues   were at low back weakness. Yeah, this is the hyper  row. This is great for my low back. Has made it   a lot stronger. And as you've told me before, a  strong low back equals a strong upper back. Well,   so the point here and why I think this is a good  exercise, the low back doesn't just feed up to   the thoracic spine, and posture, and everything  else. But the back sets the stage. You even hear   guys like Greg Jennings say, I put the team on  my back. When you got a strong back, everything   else sort of starts to fall in line. Yeah. And I  think that if a hard gainer, someone who's skinny,   maybe even dealing with some confidence issues,  goes and they start to train their back just   because they can't see it directly in the mirror  and start to train their back, a whole cascade of   good things start to happen. It's true. Right. And  if you're ever worried about seeing what your back   looks like, just stick your phone out, hold it out  in front of the mirror, you'll be able to see it.   Jesse's so experienced in shooting selfies in the  mirror. I'm so vain these days. So arrogant. So   arrogant. I'm looking for Josh Brolin to come  back again and snap his ass right out of here   again. He's already annoying me. All right, look,  I'm glad you're back. Thank you. And I'm glad that",
