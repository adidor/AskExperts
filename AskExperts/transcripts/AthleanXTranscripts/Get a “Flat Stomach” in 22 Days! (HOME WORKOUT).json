        "text": "What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com. If  you're tired of your stomach sticking out and you   want to do something about it, well, guess what?  You've come to the right place, because as always,   guys, in my 22-day series, I'm going to give  you a step by step, day by day. No failed game   plan for making that happen. I will make sure  that it's flatter than it is right now. But can   we talk about that for a second? What does it  look like right now? Because, you know, context   matters and I'm not going to BS you. If it looks  like this, then you can probably add a zero to   the end of the 22 because obviously there's some  nutritional faults here that are leading to these   high levels of body fat that's contributing in  large parts of the protrusion of that belly.    But you see, this isn't a problem just  for people at high body fat levels.   This happens to people at low body fat levels  too. Their belly sticks out no matter how much ab   work they do or how good their diet is. But guess  what? Regardless of what your body fat level is,   the plan here is going to help you because  it's going to revolve around one of the most   overlooked aspects of a protruding abdomen, and  that is the under activity of two of the most   important core muscles we just don't work enough,  the Transverse Abdominis and the Pelvic Floor.    And the good news is you won't only see the  benefits of this from a vanity standpoint,   but you're going to realize that these muscles  also impact the stability of your low back. So,   we're not just going to be looking better,  but we'd be feeling better as well.   So now, before we start laying out exactly what  you're going to do step by step in those 22 days,   I want to show you why what you're going to  work on is going to have the effect it will for   you and how it's going to benefit you, because  we have to talk about those two muscles again.   If we start from the bottom up, the Pelvic  Floor, this would be a bad Pelvic Floor because   this sheet of paper here in this position doesn't  provide much stability. However, you can see that   if I were just to roll it up from the bottom  just like this, that now in this position with   is a lot smaller in this contracted position, the  paper itself has gained a lot more stability.    And similarly, the Transverse Abdominis, I've  told you before that it works like a weight belt,   it's your internal weight belt. It runs around  your body like this right around your waist   and we know that when we can tighten  it, it provides a cinching down effect,   which is going to obviously narrow your waistline  and keep it tighter. So, if we can work those two   muscles and figure out a way to activate them  and more importantly, wake them up because they   haven't been working enough as it is, then we  can start to have a real effect on being able   to flatten out that stomach of yours.  So now the success you're going to have   over the next 22 days is going to hinge on your  ability to contract those two muscles and how to   learn how to do that properly. Now, I'm going  to give you a couple of crude methods here,   but they work and they're good visualizations. The  first is the Pelvic Floor. Two ways to figure out   how to do this, guys, if you were urinating  and you need to stop the flow midstream,   that would be the Pelvic Floor that does that. The  second thing is if you had a straw up your butt,   you had to drink a glass of milk or whatever  else your favorite beverages, you'd have to   use the Pelvic Floor in order to get that done.  Visualize that and engage that, you could do it   right now and feel what that feels like.  The next thing is the Transverse Abdominis.   You need to feel like you're walking  into an ice-cold bath of water,   contracting the Transverse Abdominis, which  is giving that weight belt shrinking effect   down, is bringing your bellybutton closer to  your spine. If you can get those two sensations,   you're going to master this and make this  work for you like nothing else has before.    So now how do we do this, guys? Over the  course of the 22 days, we have to start,   as always, with a test, because I don't  want you just to take my word for it,   I want you to have objective feedback to realize  that, yes, this is actually working for you. So,   the first one actually, though, is subjective. I  want you to stand in front of a mirror and just   take a look at yourself on days zero and see how  much your stomach is protruding. On day 22, we're   going to come back and notice the difference,  maybe even take a side-by-side photo.    The next thing to do is the objective measurement,  though, and it's called the leg lowering test.",

        "text": "And it's going to tell us how we improve in the  strength of those two muscles as we work through   that over the course of the next 22 days. You  start with your legs up as high as you can,   you engage the Pelvic Floor, as I just told  you, you engage the Transverse Abdominis,   like I just told you and you start to lower  your legs down. You need to keep your low   back in contact with the floor the entire  time your legs come down. The goal would   be to get them all the way down to just an inch  above the floor without your low back arching,   signifying that you've lost a contraction of the  Transverse Abdominis in the Pelvic Floor.    If you can get it all the way down to an inch  above the floor, then how long could you hold it?   So, on days zero, you're looking for the  point at which your low back comes off and   that is your measuring point. And we are  looking for on day 22 is the ability to   get your legs lower before your arch happens  or you get it all the way down to the ground   and you hold that for a longer period of time.  So now with those two tests in place now is when   the fun starts, because now we start working  on this day by day. And again, a very micro   commitment I'm asking for, for a big payoff at the  end. We start in the laying down position because,   guys, we need to change that posture. Again,  just because you can control these two muscles   in one posture does not mean you can control  it everywhere else. And all I want you to do   is learn how to contract the two muscles  in that position. First, the Pelvic Floor,   and then stack on top of that, the Transverse  Abdominis. And all you're going to do is hold this   for twenty seconds. Ten repetitions, that  will equal three minutes and 20 seconds.   You're going to do this three times throughout the  day. That's 10 minutes, that's all I'm asking.    On day two, we'd go into this hollowed out  position and then just simply lifting your   shoulders off the ground. But once again, now  in that position, feet can be down engaging the   Pelvic Floor in the Transverse Abdominis together  and holding it for 20 seconds, 10 repetitions,   repeat that three times. Again, the ask is pretty  small, but as you go through these days, you're   going to start to gain significant control over  the muscles that have been dormant until now.    On day three, we change now to the V-Sit position  and becomes a little bit more challenging as we   work. But again, we're just looking for a nice  static contraction. We hold it for 20 seconds,   10 repetitions. Proceeding through this now we go  into a plank. You guys know I'm not a huge fan of   the plank, but in terms of the positioning here,  it gives us a new challenge. Now we have gravity   pushing down and that belly that's already  sticking out. So, can you actually pull back   and do the same thing and activate those  two muscles in this different position?   Again, the idea is it could feel foreign and  it could feel like it's a little bit new,   but if you can gain control here, you're  well on your way to where you want to be.   Next to go into this elevated plank position,  which is a transition towards standing, but still   the same type of challenge. Can you get in this  position, create the contraction you're looking   for, hold it for 10 sets of 20? Again, day by day,  guys, very little ask big payoff at the end. We   then move to this kneeling position. This is where  it starts to become a lot more challenging. The   vertical torso here makes it a lot harder for  you to gain control of these muscles. But it's   no less important because, as you know, we're  transitioning to standing where we come most   functional. Hold it for 20 seconds a piece, 10  repetitions and your work is done for the day.    On day seven, we wrap up this static portion  of our 22-day plan by going into standing   and doing the same thing. And again, this is  going to be the most challenging position for   a lot of people. But given that you've already  gained some additional control over the muscles   over the course of the first six days, it's should  start to feel like it's wired now and something   that you can actually have control over. So now  the first seven days down where we go from here,   well, now we need to take it to the next  level because ultimately, we have to be   able to just move and not just be able to hold  and stand with the control of those muscles.   So we have a dynamic addition to those.  We're going to start back on day eight in   that laying down position, we're going to add  a little bit dynamic movement with a flutter.   Can you still hold control of those two  muscles with the additional flutter of the legs",

        "text": "at this point? Now you can do 20  repetitions, but for half the time.   I understand that doing the additional  movement can become more challenging,   so we'll decrease the time you have to do it. But  can you do this more often? It's still going to   be three minutes and 20 seconds. You're still  going to do all of these drills for 10 minutes   in the course of a day. Three times you're doing  this three minutes and 20 second sessions.    The next position, again, is going to be that  hollowed out position. But now we're going to add   the Hollow Rock exercise. Can you take that  same stability and now apply it in a dynamic   environment and create this rocking back and  forth? Again, do it for 10 seconds at a time,   20 repetitions, three times a day. On the  third day of the second seven-day block,   now we're going back to V-Sit and now I  want to see if we can just do this drift.   Drifting the hands back and forth, creating a  little bit of that disturbance left or right,   but still require that you have the stability  control, those two muscles in that position.   We move on now to the plank. In this case, we're  doing something called a Step Out Plank. Again,   establish the Pelvic Floor and  Transverse Abdominis contraction,   and now step one foot out to the side. You  can see that by having one foot off the ground   at one point, you've introduced more instability.  But if you have good control and you're building   the right control here, you're going to be  able to do this without any disturbance in   your ability to maintain that flat stomach. You then move into the Elevated Plank position   here. You just do this knee drive, bring  one leg in towards your elbow, bring the   other knee in towards your elbow, continue to  work this through your 10 seconds here again,   20 repetitions of these 10 second alternating  knees. We move into that kneeling position now.   Again, it was challenging before, we're going to  make it more challenging by adding some frontal   play and movement. Can you just walk yourself  laterally back and forth while maintaining that   tight contraction and that flattened out stomach?  And then finally we go into the last one here in   standing here do the same exact thing if we add  some lateral movement to the standing position   while still maintaining that contraction of  the Transverse Abdominis and Pelvic Floor.   So now you're through 14 days of the plan. You've  got one last seven-day block here, how are we   going to do this? Well, we're now going to see if  you can combine both of them. You go into each of   those original seven positions are now going to  perform just five of them for 20 seconds instead   of the 10 that you originally did. And then we  add the dynamic portion that corresponds to that   position. This time now, five repetitions, but  we're going to double the length of time they   have to do it before it was just a 10 ask, now  it's a 20 second ask. However, combined all that   work again is going to take three minutes and  20 seconds. You're going to do that three times   a day, still just asking 10 minutes of you. And guys, that brings us to day 22, the last test   here. Remember all you have to do, go back and  check that mirror and look and see how flat your   belly has become. Even if you were at those higher  body fat levels, you're going to see a tightening   or a cinching down the waistline if you've gained  some good control of these once dormant muscles.   And of course, I want that leg lowering test to  be done again too, see if you can get those legs   lower without seeing the low back pop up. And  remember, he didn't just improve the appearance   of your waistline, you improved the strength and  stability of your lower back at the same time.   And so they have a guy step by step. As always  here, I'm laying out the game plan for you so   you can check it out, take a screenshot, take it  with you and make sure you follow it day by day.   Guys remember, it's not a big ask and there's a  big payoff at the end. If you can follow this, I   promise it works. Don't just take my word for it.  Make sure you leave your comments below, tell me   how you're doing. Take your pictures, share them.  Make sure you show me how you've done. I know it's   going to work for you if you put the work in. Talking about that, guys, you're looking to   put more work in and you're looking for a  step-by-step game plan and even a nutrition   plan that's going to help you to get those body  fat levels down significantly, we have step by   step meal plans with all of our programs.  They're available over Athleanx.com.
