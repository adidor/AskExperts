        "text": "So come over here, guys. I want to  show you something. This is going to be   probably the best bicep video you ever seen,  including all the ones I've already done on   this channel. So, if you've been trying to build  your biceps, I'm sure at some point you're using   some version of an easy bar curl, right?  You've approached a rack like this at the gym,   you've grabbed it and you started curling  away. How you grab this thing, though,   may or may not lead to more or better results.  Because the way these bars are actually set up   is that they're set to kind of stay in one  position here on the rack, they all fall down into   one position. That's because of the way the bar is  engineered. The center of mass keeps it like this.   The problem is you look at this, it's got two  grip options here. You've got these inside grips   and you've got the outside grips. And a lot of  us don't like to grab the narrow grip because it   doesn't really feel comfortable when we're curling  like this, so we'll grab the more comfortable   shoulder width. But if you grab it like this, look  what happens as the bar is set up. I grab it. I'm   actually doing something that's less optimal for  my biceps, why because I've actually grabbed it   from a less supine position. In other words, I'm  grabbing it from more of a permanent position.   You can see that the angle of my hand when I  put this down is like this, not turned over.   So, what you have to do if you want to get more  out of this, is to actually understand that   and then flip that bar over before you grab it.  So, that when I grab this outside handle now you   can see that the hand is having to be separated  more, right? This would be that kind of flat   position. I can separate more to grab those same  grips and then get in this position to get a lot   more bicep contraction and not let the brachialis  sort of dominate the flexion of the elbow to bring   this bar up to the top. Now you probably see me  also doing something else that I do automatically   that I shared with you before, and that's the real  desire and need to keep the wrist somewhat bent   backwards at the top of a curl. It's essential  to an optimally performed bicep curl. Why?   because of anatomy. We know that an accessory  motion to supination is wrist extension,   and this is why that happens. So, if I was going  to just lay this in here like it's in my body,   you can see that this is the radius and this  is the ulna, right? And my hand is pretty   much in this position. If I want to pronate  like this, then this radius has to rotate   around the ulna, which doesn t really move.   Right? The ulna is kind of fixed. But we know   that if I want to get back into this position  in supinate and continue to go that way, that I   need to have this extension at the wrist. Why?  Because if I have a flexed wrist here and this   tries to open up, you'll see that it's actually  getting blocked by the bones that are in there.   Right? The bones, the carpal bones of the wrist  don't have freedom of movement there to allow   for that. So, if I can get into extension, all  of a sudden, that can open up a lot easier. So,   it's really important that we have that ability  to do that. So how else would this apply? Because   it's not just that exercise you're going to do.  I want to make this an all-encompassing video   for you so you get this right every single time.  So, if you were to go do, let's say, a Cable Curl,   there's a few other benefits that  actually come in play here that   help you out. So again, if I  were just to curl up like this,   I'm going to limit how much I can get in terms  of separation. I want those risks back for a   couple of reasons because number one, as the  risk go back, I'm actually going to see you   can see the elbow coming in tight to my body.  I'm able to get the elbow underneath because   I'm going to show you something in the second here  when we get to the straight bar that illustrates   exactly why you need to get this right. But I want this so I can get underneath.   And when I'm underneath, I'm getting more of that  supination by getting that wrist bent back. But   also, I'm keeping the force on the biceps with  the cable. If I curl in here like this, the line   of resistance is this line right here, this cable  line. And look at its relationship to my forearms,   right? It's approaching parallel. And we know  that in order to keep the force on the muscle,   we're trying to work. We want it to be more  perpendicular to the moving segment, in this case,   the forearm. So, if I bend those wrists back a  bit, look at the relationship now that cable is   more perpendicular to my forearm and right away I  feel a lot more tension on the biceps even at the",

        "text": "top of this exercise. And the more I can kind of  keep that by keeping the wrist bent back, I have   more tension here on the biceps. So, reason number  two of why you want to get some of that wrist   extension here as you come up. But over here at  the straight bar, you might be thinking, well, how   do you do that? Because you really again, you're  even more limited than you are with the cable   because gravities are acting straight up and down  here, not the line of force being the cable.   So, here's what we do, pulling out all the stops,  guys. Raymond, muscle marker, everything. This   area right here is where you want to direct your  force when you're curling with a straight bar.   Why? Because it's going to encourage supination  and it's going to get the elbows tucked into the   sides. How? If I grab this straight bar here and  I focus on pushing through this part of the hand   just like that, then what that does is it first  of all, it prevents the elbows from drifting,   which just takes away some of the work of the  biceps. But it actually by pushing through that   inside portion of the hand right there, you can  see the bar actually being pushed through there.   I can almost supinate my hand into a straight bar.  So not even being limited anymore by the fact that   I don't have any manipulation or orientation  of the bar that allows for more supination. So,   I'm able to come down, up, push through that inner  portion of the hand, almost allow for supination   in a bar that was once thought to be unable to  allow for that because of its fixed nature. So,   I'm able to kind of do that. And again, in order  to do that, I've got to get the elbow underneath   for leverage, so it discourages any flaring  of the elbow because it has to come underneath   to push through this portion of the hand. And then finally, if I go over to a dumbbell, I've   shown you guys this before, but again, it bears  repeating because if you understand the whole   concept, you're going to get this right every  time. And if you struggle to grow your biceps,   you're going to start growing them. So, when I  grabbed the dumbbells, I told you about an offset   grip. If you take a grip all the way at the end  of the dumbbell, the top end of the dumbbell here,   just like that. And then you curl, and you  make sure that the dumbbell is level at the top   or if anything, pinkie side higher, you're going  to make sure that you're getting the biceps to do   more of the work because the biceps are the  supinator. It's the differentiator between,   let's say, the brachialis and the biceps is their  ability to do supination. And how do I know that?   Well, quick little story you probably been  watching for a while here and wondering why   I've had this brace on or this little sleeve, it's  because I've had a bicep tear. So, if I actually   come down here, you can see the difference, right?  The fullness in here and what's lacking in here.   But when I had the injury, when I was walking  my son into school and he slipped on the ice   and I went to go grab him, I had  to assess what was going on.   The first thing I did was look at  my ability to move into supination,   not just flexion. Because if I could go like this  and still see a bicep, but not really know whether   it's torn or not. Because I could carry the  biceps along in elbow flexion and make it ball up,   but not necessarily have it still be attached. So,  the way you test for that is you want a supinate   and you can see that when I supinate just the  wrist here in the forearm that I get good movement   here. So, I have supination capabilities. It is  the differentiator between brachialis flex and the   elbow and the biceps flexing the elbow. If you  want to grow your biceps, learn from this injury,   realize you need to get into supination. The  best way to do that is to allow for it by getting   some extension at the wrist and to keep those  elbows as close to the body as possible.    Guys, I hope you found the video helpful.
