        "text": "If you're running short on time, but you don't  want to shortchange your results, I'm going   to show you what you have to do by trading and  workout length for workout intensity to keep the   gains coming in your chest. Guys, we're talking  about just 20 minutes to get the job done.    What s up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com.  Look, we've all been there short on time,   but still long on desire to not miss  yet another workout. But what do you do?   Do you skip it yet again or do you find a  way to get the job done? Today, I'm going   to show you and introduce a all-new series here  an abbreviated way to train to not compromise the   games that you're after. We're starting right  away with chests. If you only had 20 minutes,   could you get the job done? I'm going to take  you inside my head to show you the training   strategies that I use to adapt to the short time  frame to make sure we keep the gains coming.    Now, I think we should start with two  important caveats. The first is going to be,   don't make a habit out of this. I'm giving you a  game plan here to allow you to get the job done   without much sacrifice. But if you make a habit  of doing this every single time you train, I would   suggest finding time to actually dedicate more  time to training so you're not always in a pinch.   Consistency with your workouts and consistency of  effort in those workouts is and always will be the   fastest way to get to where you want to be. And that brings me to my second important caveat   here for this video and that is one exercise  you will not find in this workout is the Barbell   Bench Press. And no, not because I don't like  it. I just named it my number one exercise of   all of our chest exercises. It's the fact that  I primarily use this one for building strength.   Using this technique, these short, condensed,  20-minute workouts are not conducive to maximizing   strength. Whether it be the warmup progressions  themselves that take a lot of time for some   people, or whether it be the fact that your rest  times in between sets are generally going to   be three minutes on the low end of the five  minutes. You simply are going to run out of   time before you can even complete, let's say, a  five by five. Not to mention, as you'll see here,   we're going to have to drop the weight as we move  through this workout. Simply changing plates can   take more time than you have available to you  and doing with dumbbells is going to be that   much faster. So, the focus of this video is  going beyond hypertrophy and how to continue   to build muscle in those time crunch limited  situations. This is how we get it done.    And so the journey into my brain begins  here with our first exercise combination,   how we start our workout. And it's with the Cable  Crossover directly into the Dumbbell Static Press.   Now, this is a chest focused workout. Yes.  I'm going to get into more complexity as we   go down the line here if you guys like this  series, so make sure you let me know below.   Because we know that complexity gets increased as  we increase the number of muscle groups that are   participating in the workout. Less time we've got  more stuff to cover. But it's a little bit easier   when we focus right here. And I use the first  exercise that Cable Crossover as a pre-exhaust for   the second. You see, we know that when it comes to  chest workouts, the chest oftentimes likes to play   that third fiddle to both the shoulders and the  triceps. We don't want that to happen. We have   a limited amount of time, and we want to drive  as much tension into the chest as possible. So,   we can do that with this exercise. Now, one of the  limitations, this exercise is if you go to heavy,   it becomes a bit of a core challenge. But we don't  have to go heavy here. We can lighten up the load   and use this to really, really focus on letting  the chest initiate every single contraction.   We know when we head into the second part of this  combination, the Static Bench Press, we re going   to get the help we need from the shoulders and  the triceps. But right here, pre-exhaust the   chest by using just an exercise that allows you to  do this. Fight for every single repetition here,   take it to failure. we know. When we head into the  second part of this combination, the static bench   press, we're going to get the help we need from  the shoulders and the triceps. But right here,   pre-exhaust the chest by using just an exercise  that allows you to do this fight for every   single repetition here, take it to failure. From there we go right into that second half of   the combination here, the Dumbbell Static Press,  which is something I got from that one-legged   monster, Casey Mitchell and it's a great way to  intensify the traditional Dumbbell Bench Press.",

        "text": "And remember, if we're trading in that time, we  have to up the intensity, this for sure will do   the job. And the best part about this is I don't  have to necessarily go right into light weights   because I had the pre-exhaust before this.  I can still use relatively heavy weights,   but make sure that I'm accommodating  for those by lowering the repetitions   but still keeping the tension high.  The Static Press does that because as you   can see here, I'm maintaining that high tension  position on every single rep. Whether I'm pressing   or holding there's still a lot of tension here.  And the slow speed of every repetition is actually   pretty forgiving on those rusty shoulders, the  guys that need a lot of warm up, because the slow   pace allows you to focus one side at a time. Not  to mention the pre-exhaust before this did have a   bit of a warmup effect on getting ready to do this  second half. And so, it takes 60 rest after that   combination with the goal being to perform three  of them to form failure, the first half with a   10 to 12 reps range on the crossover and about  five repetitions each on the Static Press.   That would bring us to a combination that leads  to 6:15 of total elapsed workout time by the time   this is done. Now, a note on that rest it s 60  seconds. I understand, guys, it's a compromise.   Ideally, I'd like to get at least 90 seconds  to 120. But the way we account for that,   if we don't focus so much on maintaining  the weight that we started with.   You can see here in the second set of Static  Press, I'm okay with dropping the weight down.   Remember, your muscles don't understand  numbers, they don't read they just feel,   and they feel tension. If you can keep the tension  high by forgetting about the number of reps and   instead of making each one of those reps count,  that is how you're going to continue to ensure   the intensity is high enough to drive the  gains you're looking for in this workout.    And that brings us right into our second exercise  of this workout. Again, the clock is ticking,   we go right there to the Incline Dumbbell Bench  Press. Now for you guys there training at the gym,   you're still on the same bench you were just  using. Just prop it up here, all importantly   to that 30-degree angle, not the 60 degree. If you  don't understand why you might want to check out   my chest exercises, ranked video, where we tell  you about the all-important difference. But for   here, I simply grab this set of dumbbells  that's still on the heavier side for me,   accounting for the mounting fatigue here. I'm not trying to just sacrifice and go all   the way down to lightweights where I'm turning  this into simply a metabolic burnout workout.   You want to push and drive muscular growth,  you're going to have to push yourself hard. Here,   I m going into the Dumbbell Incline Bench Press.  I love this, number as a perfect complement to   the fact that we did a flat bench exercise first  and we have to hit the upper chest. You can see   this does a tremendous job taking the dumbbells  from more of a low position to a high position.   The key here is, again, pushing myself all the  way to failure, whatever that is, raging for   about 10 reps per set. But accepting the fact that  if I don't get it, it's really all about pushing   yourself every set to the end point to that  failure until you can't get another good form rep.   And again, three sets to form failure here with  the rest time being 60 seconds once again in   between sets. Accepting the fact that you have to  drop that weight down further and further, that s   okay, remember tension. So, the idea being if it  took me 35 to 40 seconds to do each one of those   sets when we account for the rest time and the  three individual sets here, we've now got a total   elapsed workout time of 11:15. Times ticking,  but we're looking pretty good right now.   Which brings us to our third exercise, which  is actually another combination of a Bodyweight   Dip right into a Band Assisted Dip. Three sets  again to form failure of that combination. So,   as you can see here, I grab the band and I walk my  way over to the dip station. I hang it on the dip   handle, and I get ready to do my Bodyweight Dips.  Now, my advice here is, I'm already fatigued.   If you can do 12 or less dips bodyweight, then  just stick with the bodyweight. If you're doing   15, 16, 20 of these and I would start with  weight and drop down to a bodyweight. But   for me and for most people, we're probably  going to be able to start with bodyweight   only and then drop down to the assisted dip.  The key here is we're doing three of these in a   drop step fashion instead of doing more sets of  dips and having to rest more in between sets.",

        "text": "Even if we're doing just 60, there's more inter  set rest periods, which is just simply going to   add more and more time to your workout. We don't  have time. So I go right from this exercise,   taking it to form failure. I simply take that  dip band put it up on both handles, push down,   place my knees inside and there you go, I've got  an Assisted Dip without much rest in between.   I'm not looking for a whole hell of a lot of  reps in the second half here, but once again,   trying to push myself to and through failure,  upping the intensity. Yet another technique   with this drop set to just push myself  beyond what I'm comfortable with.    This is how we're going to drive these gains when  time isn't on our side. Once again, push until I   can't do any more. I take my one-minute rest in  between sets. Again, a 60 second total there,   about 30 seconds on each half there. Now we're up  to 17:15 for our total elapsed workout time. We   still got time left. We got one more thing we can  do. In that case, I switched to my last exercise,   which is the High to Low Banded Crossover. And  for this, the workout has already conveniently   brought me to my knees with how brutal it's been.  I'm in the perfect position to do this exercise.   I'm going from that high to low position, getting  more of that lower chest. But more importantly,   the all-important adduction that we haven't  touched since the first exercise when we did   the cable crossover as a pre-exhaust. And here  my goal is simply just to seesaw back and forth   between my left arm and my right arm. This takes  about 30 seconds or so for me to just burn out   completely. I turn right into the second set,  there's no rest. The rest of my right arm is   when I'm working my left arm and the rest of my  left arm is when I'm working my right arm.   But the fact is, when we seesaw back and  forth there about 30 seconds per side   for three total sets, we've got three additional  minutes of work added to the 17:15 for a total   elapsed workout time of 20:15. Now look, don't  hold me to the exact time, it might take you   19:45 or 20:45. The fact is it's a damn fast  workout an it's going to get you to the gains   you're looking for without compromise.  And so just like that, in the nick of time   we get the work done. No, it wasn't easy, but  you guys know a life lesson here anything worth   having doesn't come easy and you can't get  something for nothing. If you want to go fast,   you're going to have to go hard. Trade  in some of that workout length for   intensity and this is how you get it done.  If you felt a little helpful and you want me to   cover more muscle groups, make sure you leave your  thumbs up below. If you want to cover more splits,   do the same thing.
