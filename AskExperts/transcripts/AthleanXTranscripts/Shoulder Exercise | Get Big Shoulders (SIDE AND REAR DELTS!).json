        "text": "What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, athleanx.com.  If you struggle to build your delts,   and I'm talking specifically about your middle and  rear delts, you know that width of your shoulder,   then you're going to want to try this exercise. As  a matter of fact, you're going to want to try it   today, because it's going to be that  significant of a change for you when you do.   Now, I've always talked about this thing, No  Man's Land Mistake, what a lot of people do,   even if they're doing a lot of overhead pressing,  they still can't build the delts because when they   do the other exercises, the lateral raises,  the front raises, even the rear delt raises,   if you don't forget to do them. You stick around  this area of the rack, this is No Man's Land. And,   stop me if I'm wrong, but when you do these  exercises, are you grabbing, let's say 15s   or 20s, maybe 25s, maybe, at most 30s. You're sort  of in this range for all of those exercises.    Well, I've talked about how there are benefits to  be had when you go down that end of the rack, the   light side. Because we know that we can actually  get the delt to initiate the contraction, actually   do more of the work, even at lighter loads and get  more stimulation from them. So, we don't want to   ignore that, but a lot of us never go down that  end of the rack. But that's where you need to be   if you're having a problem building the middle  and rear delts. So, let's take a trip together   down to this side. Now, maybe if you watched my  videos before, you have grabbed some of these   heavier dumbbells for something called a Cheat  Lateral. But the thing with the Cheat Lateral is,   if you're doing it as one of the final exercises  on, let's say, Push Day or Shoulder Day or   whatever it is how you're breaking up your program  right now, you might be a little bit drained   by the time you're grabbing the heavier weights  because it is another push dominated exercise.    I'm going to give you the tip to sort of drive  your arm away from your body when you're doing a   lateral raise. I want to show you something that's  actually posterior chain pulling dominating,   which gives us the same chance to really go  heavy here regardless of the push muscle fatigue   you might have leading up to that point. So, we  call it the Abduction Row, and again it's a row,   because that's what we're going to actually do in  terms of the motion to take that load off the push   side and move it more to the pull. We just angle  our body forward at about 30 degrees like this.   We have the heavier dumbbell in our hand. We  know that in order to hit the middle delt,   the main job is to abduct the shoulder.  It's to get the arm away from the body.   We don't have to do that through pushing, we  could do that through rowing. When we row, we know   we instantly ignite the rear delt as well.  Watch what happens. If we get in this position   here and we have the dumbbell hanging down  right in front of us, in front of our thigh,   you row it up and abduct the arm at the same  time. Row and abduct. Row and abduct away from   you. What you see is that middle delt is really  getting subjected to a much heavier load than   what you were doing down there in No Man's Land,  but it's capable of handling these. Because again,   you're getting the assistance from the rear  delt, a little bit of the back musculature,   but we're minimizing lat contribution because  we have the arm drifting far away from us.   It's not staying nice and tight in here where  the lats would tend to dominate, it's getting   out away from us, which gives us the chance  to work the entire shoulder in this area.    Again, you perform it like you would any heavier  exercise, more in the six to eight rep range.   Now Jesse's actually been doing this exercise as  well since I showed it to him but has given us a   chance to really overload it. And you can see  here it's given Jesse quite a few gains. So,   that being said guys, if you're looking for-- Hey, what's going on man.    When I mention your name, you just  come out and magically appear.   You here to show off your delts.  Grrrrr. Just like that. But I'm not here   to show off my delts, I'm here to show  off my new outro and my deadlift.    Oh my God, an outro? An outro. Ready? Run it.    Oh my God. I've created a monster.  That's right, a monster.    Guys, if you're looking for the programs,  they're over at athleanx.com. If you   haven't done so make sure you leave a comment  below.
