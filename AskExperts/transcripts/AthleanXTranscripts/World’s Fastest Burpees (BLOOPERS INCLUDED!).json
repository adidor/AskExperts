        "text": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. So I know. I've heard it. \"Physio balls. They're out of date. They're out of style. They went out with functional training a long time ago. There's no real valid use for them other than some distorted ab exercises.\" That's not true. If you expand your horizons on how you use one of these things you could become a lot more explosive. You see, we use these for reactive training. I could take a physio ball, bounce it on the ground, and incorporate an exercise in between. So today, I want to show you how to force yourself to become a lot more explosive on a burpee. Now the burpees are a great, total body exercise, but we don’t always attack them the way we should. You might need me to be there to tell you \"Faster! Faster! Faster!\" but if you don’t have me, unfortunately, then you can use this. So let me show you three ways that you could use this ball to force yourself to go faster. Okay, first up is a horizontal chest pass. So position yourself in front of a wall. Don’t worry. If you don’t have a wall I'll show you what to do instead. Position yourself in front of a wall. Chest pass the ball explosively away from you. As soon as you release it, get down, get into the burpee, pop back up, and catch it. There's two factors here that will determine how fast you would have to be; how explosive. Number one: how far away you stand from the wall. The closer you are, the harder it's going to get, as you're going to see me progress to here in this video. The second thing is how hard you actually throw the ball against the wall. Play around with both, but force yourself to become more explosive either way with this exercise. Next one, if you don’t have the ability to bounce the ball off the wall that's okay. You're going to lay on your back and throw it up in the air. If you need more head room, go outside. Throw it up in the air, and then try to pop up and catch the ball. Now, if you want to make this even more difficult, we're going to turn this into a burpee as well. All I have to do is throw it up, roll to my side, and then try to pop up from here. So I'll cover both variations. The idea though, is you've got a lot of ground to cover to get from the ground back up to your feet, and also have the orientation and coordination to find the ball and catch it. Last, but not least, the most challenging of them all: now you've got to bounce it, head down into your burpee, and come back up and find it. Now, it's a lot harder to create the time needed to get back up to do this, but more",

        "text": "importantly, as I mentioned in the last clip, the coordination to be able to come down to the ground, reorient yourself and find the ball, is going to be tough. You might wind up hitting yourself in the face once or twice. I think I did a few times in this video. The idea is, it demands the explosiveness that you're probably not generating, or giving yourself, or you're cheating yourself in the process. Try all three of these variations. I promise you, you'll find a lot more use for this physio ball than just laying on the back of it and doing some lame-ass crunches. So there you have it, guys. Another element of athletic training. Explosiveness and reactivity. If you're not incorporating these things into your program I can promise you this: you're not as good as you should be. You can get much better results if you start training your body like an athlete, and that means incorporating all elements of athleticism into one workout program. If you're looking for that, it's already done for you over at ATHLEANX.com. Head over there and get our ATHLEANX training system and let me train you for the next 90 days and see just how athletic you really are. I always say \"Unleash the athlete inside of you.\" All right, guys. I'll be back here again in just a few days. Make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below. Whatever else you want to see me cover on this channel, you leave them down below and I'll do my best to do that. All right, guys. I'll see you later.",
