        "text": "JEFF: Jesse! What the f**k are you doing now? And what are you wearing?! JESSE: I’m getting ready for summer, bro! I’m wearing a suit. Everybody knows when you’re wearing a suit during your workout you sweat more, and that means you burn more fat. JEFF: Not a suit. Maybe a sweat suit, or a rubber suit. And you believe all that stuff? JESSE: Well, I mean, seeing is believing, bro. This 8-pack is going to be better than your 6-pack by the time the summer comes around. All right, get back to work, chief! Woo! JEFF: What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. Jesse, you look great, my friend. JESSE: Thank you. JEFF: So why is Jesse wearing the suit? There are actually two reasons why Jesse is wearing the suit. One of which he’s aware of, and one of which he is not. The fact is, we posted Jesse – this is his Easter outfit. Is that what you call it? JESSE: This is my Easter outfit. JEFF: His Easter outfit. He wore this for Easter. He thought it was cute. I kind of got a hold of the picture. We put it up on Instagram. I said “Look, you want to see if you can get away with that? That’s fine, but if our followers on Instagram like this photo more than 30,000 times you’re going to wear this in the next video that we do. JESSE: Yeah. JEFF: And they, of course, blew that away. If you guys aren’t over there already it’s @ATHLEANX on Instagram. You can take part in fun things like this and make Jesse look stupid…I mean good. JESSE: Come on, man! JEFF: The fact is, there’s a second reason why he’s here. The second reason is, he’s going to help us dispel a myth today because Jesse here believes that he’s wearing a suit – some kind of a suit – if he starts sweating he’s going to burn more fat and be ready for summer. We’re going to put that to the test, my friend. JESSE: We are? JEFF: Yeah. JESSE: How? JEFF: You’re going to do a workout. JESSE: I’m going to do a workout? JEFF: Yeah. JESSE: In the suit? JEFF: In the suit.",

        "text": "That one, right there. JESSE: That? On the board? JEFF: On the board. JESSE: There’s burpees. JEFF: There’s burpees. There’s jump rope. JESSE: Yeah, there’s just – burpees in a suit? JEFF: Yeah. Box jumps, too. Don’t tear that, by the way. I like that suit. Be careful when you’re going down. JESSE: You are so- JEFF: Why don’t you do me a favor? You go back there, you start what we’re talking about, and I’ll explain the myth itself. Does fat loss equate to sweating? Do you have to sweat in order to have any impact on your fat loss? Guys, it starts by defining – get to work. Will you get to work? It starts by defining the difference between weight loss and fat loss. See, fat loss is what we’re really after. If you’re looking to get ripped for the summer and you want your abs to show you’ve got to get rid of as much body fat as you possibly can. Weight loss, however, can come very easily in the form of simply water, that’s going to be replaced very quickly by the time you’re done with your workout, just by rehydrating. By the way, before you think you can outsmart your body, your body knows what’s going on. It needs the fluids. It needs to maintain blood volume. It’s going to stimulate your thirst to make you want to go and drink more to replace the fluids. The fact is, you’re never going to outsmart your body that way. What you really want to focus on is your caloric expenditure. Can you create as much caloric expenditure as possible so at the end of the day you have a net caloric deficit that’s going to allow you to start dropping body fat when you do this consistently? Workout, after workout, after workout, after workout. Like my man here is doing. This is one. How you doing? Good. So now what we need to do is make sure when we’re going for our caloric expenditure that we’re choosing exercises that allow us to do that. The tough ones. The ones that make us really work hard. Yes, while you’re doing these things you may find that you sweat more. But what is actually happening? Sweat is simply a reaction by your body to try and help you maintain your core temperature.",

        "text": "Meaning, as you start to increase your elevated core temperature over 98.6 your body starts to release some of the fluid on the surface level here, it evaporates, and it helps you cool back down. That’s all it’s doing. It’s not a requirement for fat loss. It’s not integrated in the same process as fat loss. It’s just a thing that happens, potentially at the same time. So, let me give you another illustration here. Jesse can maybe go sit in a sauna for 30 minutes and sweat. We know he’s going to sweat a lot. I, on the other hand, who doesn’t happen to sweat very much, can go back here and do the same, exact workout in the frozen tundra and maybe not sweat at all. Who do you think is working more? That’s what I thought. Who do you think is working more? Obviously, I’m doing more. I’m burning more calories. Ultimately, those calories are going to help me be in a hypercaloric state that will let me burn fat much more effectively than this jack ass just sitting in a sauna and sweating for a period of time. So, you see, if you really want to start burning fat, guys, you not only have to be consistent with what you do, but you need to really start using exercises that put you at a high caloric expenditure. Now, I’ll leave you with this one thought. Just because the harder exercises are likely to have a higher caloric expenditure, therefore increase the amount of muscles that are working to do the job you’re trying to do, therefore have a higher likelihood of increasing your core body temperature, which therefore leads to a sweat; it doesn’t guarantee that’s going to happen in every case, guys. As a matter of fact, if you’re dehydrated the fact that you’re dehydrated is going to make your body much more resilient to offering up more water to help bring your core temperature back down again. In that case, the overall effectiveness of your workout is actually going to suffer. Your performance is going to go down because you’re dehydrated. So, chasing the sweat is not always a good idea. As a matter of fact, as I’ve said in the beginning here, it’s not related to your overall ability to burn fat. Keep those ideas separate. Guys – Jesse, why don’t you come back. Jesse. Jesse. JESSE: I’m here, bro. JEFF: What’s – what the hell? JESSE: I was listening to what you were saying, and it makes a lot of sense. So, I figured I’d change up. JEFF: That says ‘Thighway to the Danger Zone’. JESSE: Yeah, dude. Yeah. Skies out, thighs out. JEFF: Guys, hopefully we’ve dispelled this myth. I don’t know what I’m going to do about this guy.",
