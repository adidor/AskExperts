        "text": "Don't ever set a limit on your potential to achieve. Maybe you wish one day to bench 1.5 times your bodyweight. That's the goal you've set. Fine. But what happens if one day you actually reach your goal? I can tell you one of two things will happen. The first: you set your sights on a new one, if you're lucky, and you work toward improving on that. But the second, which is much more common, is you get complacent. You feel like maybe your work is done and your progress stalls out. I can tell you this: 50% of those scenarios suck. So here's an alternative. Instead, identify your weakness and work every, single day to do just one thing – at least one thing – that positively aligns your efforts with turning that weakness into a strength. Don't obsess with numbers. Obsess with your effort. Before you know it you might even be much farther ahead than what you even dreamed was possible in the first place. In this scenario, 100% of the possible outcomes don't suck. Got it? Good. Now go get it done.",
