I mean come on any list of the 20 Greatest exercises of all time for me I'm just going to have my face pull on it and I will fight that one to the death but what we're talking about here is doing it right because a lot of people never do the exercise properly the first thing you can do is from an equipment standpoint is attach two of these ropes so you can get adequate travel of your arms if not you have to have some band that's going to allow you to have wider arm angles so you can see what Jesse's doing here is he's keeping these 90 degree angles at the elbow he's not finishing closed up like this because when you're closed you tend to get into internal rotation when you're open you get to do the second thing I want you to do and that is allow your hands to beat your elbows to the back if it's a race between your hands and your elbows make sure your hands win they get back there first pause at the top to make sure you get a good quality contraction and you'll never underestimate this exercise again it's one of the best for a good reason when it comes to Vertical pressing exercises I always prefer to have you on your feet but I also like to get a little bit of momentum because I can drive more weight up overhead creating more overload and for me it's with the push press but when you push make sure you do it right A lot of people just go like this and they dip at their knees and then they try to push but you're not loading the strongest muscles in your body that's your hips and glutes so what I want you to do is hinge it's a hinge back and then load up and press but at the top we can make sure we get this right if we get it right from the bottom again if I hinge and then squeeze my glutes",
