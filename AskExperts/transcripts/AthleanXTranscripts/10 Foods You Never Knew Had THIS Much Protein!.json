        "text": "talking about six grams for something like cheddar cheese so this one stands alone at the top in terms of the high protein content per gram that being said the italian meat is going to make it impossible to not finish this segment without the public service announcement to say find the right parmesan cheese meaning the one that bears the name parmesan reggiano because it's only those cheeses that have that exact name that are actually the real parmesan cheese everything else is an imitation and in those imitations you've got extra ingredients that kind of help with the shelf life things that you really don't want to put in your body again we've got the cheese here you throw that on top of your peas and your pasta you got to have a carbonaro going so mom and dad weren't the only ones that were right all along when they were telling you what to eat so was this guy you know the guy with giant forums that didn't resort to jesse's methods and of course we all know his go-to source of protein spinach five and a half grams of protein per cup of cooked spinach again something you're probably not aware of that has as much as it does when you look at it on a plate you realize it's really not a health a lot and it leaves a lot of room in your plate for other things but it's not just the benefits of protein that i'm a fan of when it comes to spinach this is one of the most calorically light but nutrient dense foods you can put in your body because we know it has only six carbohydrates per serving size that's a lot lower than all the other food choices we've seen so far and again it's just 41 calories to pack five and a half grams of protein we're doing something good here not to mention the fact that we have a lot of calcium magnesium and also vitamin a to increase the potency of this food guys it's one you're not going to want to overlook",

        "text": "there's a lot of ways we can actually make this taste better because you can put a lot of things in cottage cheese to do that pro tip from me add a little bit of cinnamon it will cut down some of that sourness by introducing some of the bitterness of the cinnamon itself guys no matter how you put it there's no overlooking the impact that cottage cheese provides when you're looking to bump up those protein totals likely even higher than you ever thought and so as we move over to the next food here you might be thinking to yourself she's not really craving that 10 ounce filet with over 50 grams of protein or you're saying you know what jeff this is actually helping me out and i'm finding new ways to actually supplement my protein intake and to add new ways to do it well guess what the next one here is actually one that i actually supplement out a carbohydrate for when i'm seeking protein and this is quinoa see quinoa has eight grams of protein per cup and once again you can see that there's not a lot when we're talking about one cup and the nice thing about the use of this as i mentioned i like to swap out a carbohydrate to put this in my diet and that means rice oftentimes i have meals that have a bed of rice on the bottom if i swap that out for a bed of quinoa you can pretty much double this from 8 to 16. i've got another avenue here when i'm seeking a higher protein alternative while still satisfying my carb craving and oh by the way this here a complete protein so no missing out on any essential amino acids with this option and speaking of complete proteins the next food's another one that makes this way to my plate sometimes but in moderation you see we're talking about soybeans or specifically edamame you see there's a lot of mixed research out there when it comes to these estrogenic type foods at least some people say they promote estrogen and others will say they have estrogen blocking capabilities",
