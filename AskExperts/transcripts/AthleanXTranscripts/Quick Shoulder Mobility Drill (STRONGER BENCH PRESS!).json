I want to show you today a quick shoulder mobility drill that you can do in a slightly different way than you're already doing it to find out a lot more information about the stability of your shoulders. Mobility and stability are always going to interchangeably work together. How much you have of each and how much they work together is very, very important. Especially when we're talking about the big lifts. You see, when some people do bench presses they'll get shoulder pain as they press out, or on their way down. It may not always be about the strength of the structures that are hurting – say like the bicep tendon – but maybe about the mobility or stability of the structures that are supporting that. This is a perfect example of how we can actually start to assess that. If we do this normal drill, which we probably do this instinctively, we want to get our shoulders to feel better so we do shoulder circles. We go back to work on the external rotation, here, of our shoulders; that way. Then we come forward, or obviously we'll do both. Internal and external rotation is a great way to feel loose and give us a good way to warm up our shoulders before we hit the bench press or upper body movement. But if we take a band and incorporate it with it, we get a lot more information from the move. What we do is take a band, now you hold it out at arm's length. You put tension on the band by doing a bit of a band pull apart. So you can see that my arms are out in front of me, they're not bent, they're not closed; they're out in front of me because I'm actually trying to protract and get my cerates to have to fire and stabilize. Now as my cerates are engaged here – the cerates is going to help to keep our shoulder blade tight to our rib cage, where we want it to be, for more stability. Now we're here, now we try to perform the over and back. So what we do is, we take the band, we move it up, and I'll turn around this way so you can see what I'm doing. You pull the band apart as your arms are traveling back behind your body. The key here, above all, is to go slow because if I lack stability in my shoulder blades, the one thing that you're going to probably find will happen to you is the band will snap down. As soon as you get to a point where you can't control the band, or you don't have the stabilization through the muscles here in your shoulder blades, you're going to find that it snaps. So you want to go so slow, as you go all the way back, that you control every single centimeter of the travel. All the way back, and at the bottom it doesn’t touch your back. It stays away from your body, and you're able to reverse the direction, come back in front of you, back to this original position. Again, from the front to here, arms are outstretched, band is coming up; this is a hard exercise. Again, it's just working on those small stabilizers that we often overlook. Of course, look at all the mobility I need in my shoulders to be able to do it. Again, at the bottom I don’t let it hit me, I'm going nice and slow, it stays away from me and I'm able to reverse the direction and come back to the front. Okay. Just like that, try if you can get even six to ten reps of that without letting it hit.",

        "text": "You're going to see where your weaknesses are if you have them. The idea here is: is this a small movement? Yeah. Is it unimportant? Absolutely not. You can't overlook the small things because they have big implications on the big things. Like I said, bench pressing might be undercut. Your bench pressing and how much you can bench press is being undercut by the stability of the muscles that wrap around and stabilize your whole body as you perform the bench press. So if you want to lift big to get big, that's fine; but you'd better be able to have the supporting muscles there to be able to allow you to lift big in the first place. I hope you guys found this helpful. Again, if you want a program where we don’t overlook the little things because we realize how important they are, head to AthleanX.com right now and get our complete Athlean-X training system. If you've found this video helpful let me know below. Try it out, let me know how you do. I'd be curious to know how many of you can go over and back 10 times. Going really slow, though. Really slow; that's the key, without letting this band snap around and control you. All right guys, we'll be back here again soon. See you!",
