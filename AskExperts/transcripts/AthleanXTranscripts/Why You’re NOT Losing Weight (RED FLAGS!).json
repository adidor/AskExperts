        "text": "So, you've done absolutely everything,  but you just can't lose weight.   Look, it's time to pull up a  chair, you may need to talk.   What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com.  So, if you're struggling to lose weight,   we have to do something about it and that's why I  want to sit down and have this conversation with   you today. Because there's two categories that  you might find yourself in right now. Number one,   maybe you really want something to happen,  but you're not willing to put in the effort   to get there. And if that's the case,  I understand what the struggle is,   but you know that until you start to do  something about it, nothing is going to change.   But oftentimes I find people are in the  other category actually doing something,   they're trying, but it's still not working. And in  that case, there's five things that I listen for,   five key phrases that I listen for. What I do  is I call my red flags because if I hear them,   they're instantly alerting me as to what your  problem actually is and why you're not where you   want to be. And I have to throw the red flag if  I hear them. If I can raise your awareness here,   I can make the change you're looking to make. So  that said, guys, let's start breaking them down   one by one. Are you saying any of these things?  Because if you are, I'm throwing the flag.    What's the best exercise to  do to get rid of this?    So, we have to start right here, because this  question I've heard probably a million times.   And don't worry, if you've asked it yourself, it's  okay, because today we change these things. You   see if you've ever pointed here and said, \"What  can I do for this?\" Or you put it over here,   and said, \"Is there a good exercise, Jeff, that  can help me with this?\" Or maybe you've pointed   over here and said, \"What's the best exercise  for this area?\" The line of thinking is flawed   and that is what's holding you back. Because  we know not only is that exercise not going   to be capable of targeting any specific  area on your body, but more importantly,   it's not about exercise at all and it never  will be. It's about nutrition. If you don't   create a hypercaloric state, you're not going  to lose the weight that you're seeking to lose.   Even if you took an exercise like a Burpee that's  pretty metabolically demanding, it only burns 13   calories per minute and that's requiring you  to do it minute after minute after minute. The   changes you need to make have to happen in what  you're putting in your mouth every single time.   I don't understand. I do  fasted cardio every morning.   What the hell? All right. So, this one might   come as a surprise to you because you're thinking,  Jeff, I know better. There's no crunch is going   to get rid of my midsection. But I do know that  cardio is important, and I know that fasted cardio   is even better. Not really. You see, not only  is cardio not the main driver of your results,   nutrition is, but fasted cardio is actually no  better than cardio itself. As a matter of fact,   research shows that though you might burn a higher  percentage of fat within the session, you actually   burn a lower percentage of fat after the session  versus a fed cardio session. And when it nets all   out, you're actually burning about the same. No  matter when you do your cardio guys is going to   allow you to create some additional energy deficit  to help you with creating that hypocaloric state,   but even then, the contributions are minimal.  Instead, you should think of cardio as a way to   strengthen your heart and focus your efforts  on cutting the deficit through what you put   in your mouth. It's always going to come  down to nutrition because even an intense   calorie burning cardio session might get you a  600-700 calorie deficit, that can all be undone   by choosing the wrong foods at the next meal.  It's certainly not my diet, I'm a clean eater.   Okay, what the fuck? All right so there's one that   makes my ears perk up more than any others, this  one right here. As soon as someone defines their   way of eating as \"clean eating\" I know right  off the bat there's something wrong. You see,   they might be trying though, and that is they'll  say, \"Jeff, I eat chicken, fish, oatmeal and   salad.\" And I say, \"Wow, that's a great start.\"  Until I realized that when I think chicken, they   think chicken parmesan. And when I think fish,  they're thinking sushi. And when I think oatmeal,   they think Quaker Maple & Brown Sugar Oatmeal.  And when I think salad, they think salad. You see",

        "text": "semantics matter here. The difference in words  matters because it's the difference in a lot   of calories. If you want to compare these foods  calorically, you'll see that they're not at all   the same other than sharing a single ingredient.  If you want to get this right, guys, educate   yourself as to the differences between these  foods and realize that the differences matter,   especially if you're looking to create  long-term permanent weight loss.    I'm totally locked in, I'm following the Atkins  diet. I mean, I'm doing the South Beach Diet.   I'm actually Paleo all the way.    Look, whether it's South Beach, Atkins, Keto  or Paleo, the fact that you have a name for   how you eat is an indicator to me that you've got  a short-term solution to your long-term problems.   You need to figure out how to make this a  permanent lifestyle if you're looking for   that long-term permanent weight loss. I mean,  ask yourself how many times in the last five   or 10 years have you had a different name for  how you eat? If you ask me that same question,   I can go back 30 years and the answer will still  be the same zero. Because what I do is more of   a lifestyle, it doesn't carry a name with it. We  all know that names are oftentimes associated with   diet plans and diet plans by nature are short-term  fixes because you even call it that yourself.   I'm on this diet or I'm off this diet. Never, I'm on this for the rest of my life.   And oftentimes we know that what you do to get  to where you want to be in terms of your weight   loss goals is what you need to stay with to stay  your weight loss goals. Look, the key here is   say the names for kids and puppies and  not for how you eat and I promise you,   you'll find the long-term permanent  weight loss you're after.    I just want to get my beach body ready for  the summer this year. Not this time.    Now look, I would never begrudge somebody from  setting a goal, that's a good thing. Especially   for establishing motivation to get you going.  But when your goal date has an expiration to it,   you're setting yourself up for failure. Look,  maybe you talk about a summer cut, but summer is   eventually going to turn to fall to can be over.  Then what happens? Or maybe you want to get ready   for that family vacation and you want to look good  on the beach, but the vacation is going to end at   some point. Or maybe you just want to look good  at that reunion again. But when the reunion is   over that night, then what happens? Oftentimes we  find ourselves going back to exactly what we did   to put ourselves in the situation where we're  looking to get in shape again for the next event.   You have to look deeper than that, guys. You've  got to look for that internal motivation if you're   looking for that real long-term success. I know  personally, for me, I got a lot of people who   depend upon me for motivation and information. That's a good deep driver for me. But more   importantly, all I have to do is look to my  two sons. I realize that they look at me as a   role model and I want to make sure that I don't  disappoint them in the long run. I have a deep   inner drive and a motivation to keep me where  I want to be. You need to do the same thing,   find what lies beneath the surface, literally.  And I promise you, that's where you're going   to find your permanent weight loss success.  And then you have a guys, my five red flags that   I listen for that allow me to get to the bottom  of your weight loss issues so that you can finally   get there. And remember, if you've asked any of  these questions yourself, don't be embarrassed.   Instead, be inspired, because with the awareness  will come the long-term success. If you're looking   for programs, guys, we have all laid out over at  athleanx.com. Complete deli meal plans. If you're   looking for my daily meal plan of what I do every  single day, I'll link that at the end of this   video.
