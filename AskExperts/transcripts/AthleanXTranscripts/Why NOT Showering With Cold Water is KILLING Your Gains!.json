        "text": "killing games because there's a lot of research out there that says that cold showers actually blunt muscle growth really and hypertrophy and the reason why is because it basically interferes with the growth factors and mediators that happen after training okay that is usually followed in these studies by submersion okay so not taking a shower that's not a shower so to keep that point in mind for a second here cold water submersion is different that's like getting into an ice tub and dunking down and spending a considerable amount of time in there again likely something you're not doing right now but is that true yes it is again the studies will show that the inflammatory processes that happen following training that would be the stimulus or the initial stimulus for additional growth over time through recovery get blunted by the immediate use of these cold water submersion tactics that will actually blunt the overall hypertrophy response over time and it's a pretty significant blunt thing actually when they compare the control group to the people that are actually there doing this really yeah so it's not really a good thing to do now if you were strength training you weren't focused on muscle growth you really wouldn't see the same negative effect from the cold water submersion following training because it wasn't again that inflammatory driven process that drives muscle growth and hypertrophy okay right so if you're a strength trainer alone just looking to build your strength top level strength you're likely not going to see the same detriments from doing that right but what about athletes well so interestingly athletes in major league baseball we used to have pitchers that would routinely follow a game by going into a submersion setting and actually do that to improve the",

        "text": "recovery and the reason why that actually worked and why it's a good thing is we're not looking to build muscle in season or drive hypertrophy as our main goal in season performance is what's the driving factor in season right and particularly for a pitcher your performance and more importantly a recovery to come back for your fifth day start matters a lot so using submersion training to attack the same inflammatory processes that would hold you back from recovery is the same reason why you'd actually want to do it okay so it is having a negative effect on people are looking to drive muscle growth but not on an athlete who's trying to improve performance and increase recovery so that's the thing but again we're not necessarily talking about that setting so as always it's the setting and the application that matter and the timing that matter too so if we're not talking about cold water submersion we're talking about showers and that's something that you actually did a little bit of cold showers yeah i actually um you know that was something i experimented with a little bit uh i started out irresponsibly and i jumped in a cold shower for surprisingly unbelievably five minutes and that sucked but after that i decided that i was gonna do uh contrast which was going cold and then warm or stepping away from the shower but i noticed when i started out that i was you know i couldn't breathe i was shivering i was contracting my muscles so tightly so we've all experienced this when you get into cold water all of a sudden you feel like you can hardly breathe your stomach gets sucked in i talk about it actually being a good way to activate your transverse abdominis in pelvic floor because you sort of lift everything up you know and for leroy and his shrinkage you would know what i'm talking about",

        "text": "lower cortisol levels now here's the most important thing if you are chronically having high levels of cortisol a couple things are going to happen number one you're not going to see much muscle growth because cortisol is going to blunt your body's ability to recover and as a natural trainer the number one thing you can do is figure out all of the things that can benefit your recovery which would be sleep okay better nutrition okay no gummy bears no oh it's done now no uh how you you know space out your training split right right you're not banging away the same stuff every single time your intensity level in your training split is there anything you can take so you can supplements you can take we have rx3 which is our number one recovery supplement we you could take you could take a bunch of different things which is you know highly leucine and glutamine driven you can take different supplements to try to aid that but the number one thing you have to do is make sure that all of these things are in place because just picking and choosing a couple of them are not going to give you the bang for the buck that all of them will okay now that being said this is one of the ones that people never do but again it has a a pretty dramatic ability to blunt cortisol particularly from those people that are running around at high static cortisol levels now okay so if your cortisol levels run fairly high right now you probably wouldn't know it unless you have blood work done and until you try something like this you might be amazed at what it does and how much it allows you to start seeing some growth so what i'm suggesting is is this a tool is not taking cold showers killing your gains i believe it could be especially if you're doing all the other things right right now in your recovery and you're just not seeing the gains from your workouts if",
