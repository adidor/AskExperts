Especially if you want to build bigger arms without needing heavy weights because you can use your own bodyweight and certainly overload your arms. When you think about how much your body will weigh if you actually use it as a resistance, your biceps and triceps are no match. Let me show you a little circuit here that you can do, that will put your biceps and triceps to the test without having to use any weights at all. The first thing we do is we get up on our pullup bar. This is one of my favorite, absolute best exercises you can do for your biceps because we can direct constant, tie-motor tension on our biceps using our body as overload. So more than I can probably curl. So I get here, I get my body on the bar, and I push away just a little bit so my arm is almost at 90 degrees. So now I turn this more into a chin curl – static chin curl – that you have to try to hold for five seconds. Now, as I work to hold this, obviously, I'm going to get negative eccentric overload as my bicep starts to lengthen out. We know that eccentric overload is necessary for creating the micro-damage that's responsible for muscle growth. Strength is a different issue. When we're talking about muscle growth we get this eccentric overload here, I hold it 45 seconds, fight for everything I can. Once I get done with that I drop down to a bar that I have setup here. Now, if you're doing this at home use a broom stick over two chairs. Use the back of, or the underneath side of a counter. Whatever you have to use. Here, you get down now and you slide out this way. A little bit further. Now we have an inverted chin curl. So from here, our feet are flat, come up, and now I'm curling once again. Now, from here I've got a little bit more of a challenge. 45 seconds, yet again. I try to hold, hold, and hold. Again, the tendency is going to be for me to have to give in to the weight, but I can't. I've got to hold myself up, squeeze as hard as I can, 45 seconds. All right, I keep going, keep going, keep going, and fight it. From here we head back up to the top. We go 30 seconds up there. We go 30 seconds back down here. 20 seconds up there. 20 seconds back down here. That's only half your arm though. Now we have to go to the other side. So what we do is, with this bar that we have down here we do our tricep extensions. Again, we're going to have an exercise here that will allow us to isometrically overload the triceps in the elongated position to hit the longhead and have enough eccentric overload as our body tries to resist the movement down into this stretched position. So they come down in here, I get right down into this position here.",

        "text": "Now, my bodyweight is lengthened out behind me, I have a lot of resistance here to hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Again, it's going to push me more into this position. Stretch out the longhead. 45 seconds. Fight it. Fight it. You get all the way to 45, come straight down to the ground. Now we're working on that contracted position and you go right into our L-sit, or a modified L-sit. I'm just going to take my hands, press them down to the ground right there, and hold. 45 seconds. You have to. You can see my heels are slightly touching the ground. Very, very, very lightly. Oh, man! Not fun. Go all the way down, 45 seconds. 30, 30, 20, and 20. So guys, don’t let anybody ever tell you that weights are necessary to create big arms. If you know how to use your own weight as the resistance you can do plenty of damage in a short period of time. If you're looking for a complete training program that shows you how to use techniques like this, to take advantage of limited space, limited equipment, or even just some of the techniques that you didn't know before; head to ATHLEANX.com and get our ATHLEANX training system. We also have our ATHLEAN0 program that doesn't even use any of this stuff. No bars, doesn’t need anything. No pullup bars either. That's over at ATHLEANX.com. In the meantime, I hope you've found this video helpful. I'll be back here again in just a few days. Leave your comments and thumbs up below. Let me know what you want to see and I'll do my best to cover it in the days and weeks ahead. I'll see ya!",
