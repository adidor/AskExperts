        "text": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere. Athleanx.com.  Today we're talking all about the traps. A new   series here we're going to break down  the anatomy, the function of the traps,   and most importantly, all the exercises--  Jeff, Jeff, Jeff! You forgot my intro. But   you're not even in this video. Well that's  why I'm here now. I'm in the video. Run it.   Jesse. Ooh. Jesse. How is that any different  from the last one? Clearly you didn't hear   the explosion then. Of course this is spoken by  someone that doesn't understand the nuances of   introduction creation. Yeah, I just heard  a lot of noise, that's it. You know what?   You're a lot of noise, dude. A distraction.  Can you just get out of here? All right,   fine. But the next introduction is going to  be even better, I promise. Back to the regular   scheduled programming here, guys, the traps.  Today I want to show you what to do, how to   hit these muscles the best. Let's get it started  guys. A lot of information to cover. So when it   comes to the anatomy of the traps, like any other  muscle, it's important to look at the orientation   of the fibers within that muscle. I say it all the  time, if you want to see how a muscle functions,   then follow the fibers. And with the traps having  three different zones and areas really, we know   that there's three different orientations of the  fibers that we're talking about. In the upper area   of the traps we're talking about an orientation  that runs down and out, starting at the back of   your skull on that bump that you can feel back  there, and running out towards the tip of your   shoulder. And because we know that they're running  up in this direction, some type of elevation of   the shoulder girdle is a dead giveaway. But  beyond that, take advantage of the fact that   these things do run this way and not just straight  up and down, it's going to give us an indication   of something we might want to include when we  talk about upper trap training that I'm going   to show you in a second. When we move down,  we start to work towards the attachments on   the thoracic spine. We see that it becomes more  of a parallel orientation, just east and west,   and that's going to give us an idea that they're  not necessarily responsible for shrugging up and   down in the middle trap area, but they're actually  responsible for retracting the shoulder blades and   bringing them and pinching them back together. So  exercises that favor this motion are going to be   able to hit these fibers more appropriately. And  we work ourselves down to the bottom in the lower   traps and we realize that the fibers now start  to go down in this direction. Now we're looking   at something that wants to pull the shoulder blade  down and back help to depress them particularly as   we raise our arm up overhead for stability, and  we realize that the exercise options available   to us there are going to once again reinforce  that function. So with that being said, guys,   let's start breaking them down zone by zone,  upper, middle, and lower traps to really find   out not just how these things work the best, but  most importantly, what exercises work these areas   the best. All right, so when we start with the  upper traps, the thing I want to jump out at you   more than anything else is because these fibers  are doing this and running in this direction,   they're the ones most responsible for everything  that gravity is trying to make more difficult for   you. Meaning that this area of the traps is the  one that bears the greatest load on a day in,   day out basis. Meaning that it is the one that  responds best to higher tension loads. So as we   talk about when it comes to any muscle function,  there's a couple ways to do this. Number one,   we could do it for more duration, and the traps  happen to be a good, long duration muscle because   of the responsibilities of carrying your arms in  the proper position day in and day out. But again,   beyond that, they have a much higher capacity  for load. So here I want to go long duration,   I'm looking at exercises like the carry. And I'm  talking about either done with dumbbells. Right,   you could use up any pair of dumbbells and walk  around your living room if you're training at   home, or walk around the gym, obviously. Or you  could use a trap bar, which makes it a little bit   more challenging to balance this for a little bit  more stability of the upper traps. Or you could   hold a pair of kettle bells as well. Again, all  of them reinforcing the same function, and do it   for time. See, these long duration exercises are  best performed for time when we're talking about   at least 60 seconds and upwards of two minutes.  If you want to go for a high tension load where   we want to do it for more of a short duration to  try to create more strength in this muscle group,",

        "text": "then the thing we should be looking to do here  is some version of a shrug. Right, the shrugs   are not necessarily measured in time, but in  reps. So here we talk about loading up a bar,   and again, performing this upward shrug of the  shoulders, just pulling them up towards your   ears. We know that's one of the main functions of  the muscle. Hold on for a second for a variation   that could be even slightly better. The same  thing here could be done obviously with a trap   bar as well. The difference though, as I want you  to see, is that the angle of the arms becomes not   just completely vertical, but angled outwards,  and that should jump out at you as well. That   means it's reflecting more of the orientation that  the fibers are following in the first place. Where   we talked about how they don't just go up and  down, but down and out. So the trap bar shrug   gives us a little bit better angle to mimic  and mirror that so it's a great way to do the   exercise. But I've been talking about that other  variation. And this is the one I like to do with   a cable. And now I'm doing that shrug and pulling  my shoulder up towards the back of my head here,   right towards the origin, except this time I'm  doing it directly in the same orientation as   those upper trap fibers, giving me a better angle  of pull, giving me a chance to really overload and   create significant tension here, especially if I'm  trying to build this muscle up for more strength   and size. So instead of working our way down to  the middle traps, I want to skip that zone for now   and go down to the lower traps. Because, see, if  the upper traps are responsible for high tension,   then the lower traps are responsible for focused  tension. Meaning that their job is really more   about stability than necessarily providing  overload. But we can do the same thing here, we   can apply more of a long duration load or a short  duration load, depending upon the exercises that   we pick. If we're talking about long duration,  then the exercises that I like here are number   one: the Y press. We know that the lower trap's  job is to provide that depression of the shoulder   blade and the stability of the rotation of the  shoulder blade as our arms raise up overhead.   Well, the Y gives a sort of an on ramp to rotation  overhead. Right, because we don't go all the way   straight out overhead, we're just going up at an  angle of about 45 degrees. So it's a good place   to start, but again, the key here is not to rush  through this or to try to load this up, the key is   to provide a good solid contraction. If you're not  feeling it, then you're wasting your time. Quad   repetitions is the only thing that matters here.  But if you're looking for that next step, then   instead of just going at that Y angle, go for it  up overhead. This is called the prone press. And   once again, the load is sort of irrelevant here.  You don't even really need to use any weights at   all if you don't have the ability to use them.  But the point is that you keep yourself in this   slightly retracted position to get a little bit  of that middle trap engagement, but most of all,   it's about raising your arms fully up overhead as  much as you can and providing that stability from   the lower traps to make that work as smooth as  possible. That said, if we shift the focus away   from the long duration to the short duration  rep measured way to train this area, then the   first exercise here that I want you to do is the  plate raise. As you raise your arms up overhead,   the lower traps now have to fire and engage. Make  sure those lower trap fibers are doing their job   to stabilize your arm in the overhead position.  You slowly lower it down to work on the eccentric   component of that muscle, and again, you raise  it back up again. This is not going to go on for   a long period of time here, guys. You're looking  for that 12 to 15 repetitions always high quality.   And then of course, you know I had to cover the  face pull. But this is a variation of the face   pull that I've showed you more recently that I  love even more than the face pull. Because it's   got all the elements of the perfect face pull with  the additional arm reach that we get here with   this overhead press. And we know, once again, that  as I press up overhead, as lower trap fibers are   going to be recruited quickly to make sure they  do what they always do to provide that stability   as those arms go up overhead. But it's got all the  components here, even has the retraction component   that we get for those middle traps too that makes  this just a winner exercise every single time,   no matter which way you look at it. And now having  covered the upper fibers and the lower fibers,   I saved the middle fibers for last for a couple  reasons. Number one: they usually get relegated   to last place because nobody ever really trains  them. That's going to change right here today.",

        "text": "And secondly, they kind of have a hybrid function.  You could hear that I've already mentioned that   they want to kick in while we're doing some of  the upper trap work, and even some of the lower   trap work. So their function is a combination of  high tension, high-low capabilities, and focused   tension capabilities that we get from the lower  traps. Well, I've got two exercise options for   you. Number one: a body weight one, and this  is called the back widow. And the back widow is   key to hitting this area because we're driving  the elbows into the ground. You see, if I were   to take my elbows out the ground and drive with my  hands, I get more extension of the arm back behind   my body, but this is going to shift the focus more  towards the rear delt, and even the triceps as I   extend my elbows. We don't want that. To really  get to those middle traps, which are a harder   to hit area, we want to make sure that we drive  with the elbows. But from there, we could actually   go into a long duration hold. And that's just by  simply getting in the position, and like I said,   holding it. So we have the ability to do the  same exercise in two different ways just by   simply either getting there and staying there or  doing this more as a repetition focused exercise.   Which gives me that second option here, which is  one of my favorite ways to train the middle traps,   and it's the wrap around row. And once again, we  could do this in two ways. We could do this either   as a long duration hold or as a short duration rep  focused exercise. And the key here though is the   set-up. You can see that I have my cable machine  set wide. Why are we doing this? Because we're   actually trying to get a good pre-stretch here on  the middle traps. And I could do that here because   by getting my arms across my body, I've opened  up my shoulder blades as much as I possibly can.   I've protracted them around my body as much as  I possibly can. This sets the stage for a better   recruitment of these harder to reach fibers right  from the get-go. The fact is, this is one of the   best ways to overload this area if you want to  load the weight up, or decrease the load a little   bit more, and focus more on that high tension.  Remember, this area is capable of both, which you   do is up to you. So there you have it, guys, all  about the traps, breaking it down scientifically,   and most importantly, showing you what you need  to do to train this area and to train it right.   Remember, guys, there's no unimportant muscles  here. You got to make sure you train them all.   When it comes to muscles in the back you got to  make sure you train them even all more. Because   those areas tend to get neglected, but not after  this guys, remember we're going to hit all three   areas-- upper, middle, and lower, and now you've  got the attack plan to do that.
