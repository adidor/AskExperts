It's great to get outside and I wanted to give you an awesome fat burning workout that's based around sprinting, running, athleticism; to help you to burn some fat, but give you something that you can actually do. Because a lot of us have a baseball diamond around us somewhere. Just a Little League park, anywhere outside when you feel like getting out. I'm going to give you an actual workout you could do out here that we would use with our Major League baseball players to help them get in shape. Particularly in spring training. So it's just running the bases, but we have a strategy for running the bases. As you can see we have, right here, 90 feet from home to first base. 30 yards. So what we're going to do is run singles straight through the bag. So we start off, we do four singles straight from the bag. You can see me running them right now. You try to get out there as fast as you can, each time trying to increase your speed, if you can, down to the baseline. Then we come back each time, our rest is our walk back to home plate. Now we're going to hit some doubles. So now we're going to run and we've got a little bit of a turn. So we've got some agility built into this. So you want to make the turn on the bag. Actually, we donâ€™t even have bags here now because we're off season, but you're going to make the turn as quickly as you can, as safely as you can, down to second base; there's your double. So it's a little bit longer of a run. Obviously, a little bit more stamina needed to do that. From second base, each time, you're going to score from second. Now you simulate a hit to the outfield. You're going to make a nice turn on third base and you're going to try to score. So three times from the doubles, and three times scoring from second, to get back home. Now we'll hit some triples. Triples is a little bit more difficult. We have to make two turns in there, and of course the stamina requirements are increased even more and you're probably already sucking wind by now, but that's exactly what we're supposed to be doing here. Increasing your endurance. So now we're going to run down three triples, and then from here we're going to tag up. So the cool part about tagging up, as you can see, is that you have a lot of quick change of direction going on. So when the ball is hit to the outfield you're simulating that. You're going to run down, halfway down the baseline. Now you see the ball is caught. You've got to stop, run back, touch third base, and then change direction again, and",

        "text": "sprint as fast as you can home, to make sure you beat the throw. So now you're going to do two triples, with two tag ups. Then finally, we saved the best for last. You'll have the inside the park homerun. Now this is a bitch. You've got to run all the way, as fast as you can. You see this. You smell it. You can smell the score. You're going to get across home, but you've got to get there before the throw beats you. So you've got to get out there as fast as you possibly can. Sprint down, make the turn, make the turn, make the turn, get here safely, and you've done your job.
