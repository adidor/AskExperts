Listen, no matter what derogatory term you may have heard targeted at you, hopefully after this video today, this is the last time you're ever going to hear them. What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, athleanx.com. So I spent a good amount of time in clubhouses and locker rooms, I could tell you I've heard the insults flying around. As a matter of fact, pointed at me a few times. And we all know that, especially when it's something we're self-conscious about, doesn't really feel that good. So, if you heard any of those things, hopefully, like I said the last time, you ever going to hear it, because in this video, I'm going to try to solve your problem. And I realized that when it comes to excessive amount of chest fat and a saggy chest, that a lot of guys don't even feel comfortable leaving the house, pandemic or not, to head out to the beach because of how self-conscious they feel about this problem. Well, the good news is I'm going to show you something you can do without ever having to leave the house. Four things that you can do at home to start getting rid of this problem today. As a matter of fact, number four is something you can start doing right now to start making a noticeable improvement. So that being said, guys, let me start breaking them down one by one. So, step number one is what I want you to do as soon as you're done watching this video, make sure it's after you're done watching the video. And that is I want you to walk over to a mirror, take a good look, and then get real. And part of doing that is knowing actually what problem it is that you're facing, because not all saggy chest issues arise from the same cause. See, if your chest looks like this with the majority of the fat centralized around the nipple, maybe it's even a little hard or a little sore when you touch it. That's not really a chest fat problem, that's something called gynecomastia, it can come from steroid abuse, it can come from just simply having the wrong genetics. But the fact is the treatment is different. You're going to need maybe surgical or at least medical approaches to get to the bottom of that problem. But here's the good news. Only about two out of 10 people that have saggy chest issues are actually dealing with that as the problem. More of us are dealing with this, and it's simply just an abundance of fatty tissue in the breasts and that's something that men don't want to have. And it can happen at any level of body fat, as you can see. So, if you're still with me and yours is a body fat issue, let's move to step two, because that's where we start to make a really big impact. So now with body fat accumulation identified as the root cause of your problem, we now move on to step two. And the good news here is that we're not looking at medical or surgical intervention to fix what ails you. Instead, we're looking at what you can do and solely what you can do because you have the power to make this change. But I have some bad news for you.",

        "text": "Your diet sucks. Or at least it's not good enough. Because no matter how you're eating right now, let's face it, it's not good enough to get you where you want to be. Any body fat accumulation issue is always going to come down to the fact that you're not eating healthy enough. We have to make some changes. And those changes happen in trying to cut back some calories to create a calorie deficit that's going to help you to start burning that body fat away. You don't get a choice of where you lose this, and that's actually going to come and help us out in the long run here, as I'll explain in a second. So how much are we talking about here? Well, first, let me give you a little bit of uplifting news. If you were to ask me, Jeff, how difficult is it going to be for me through dietary changes to fix this problem? On a scale of zero to 10? I'd say this is about a three or four. Now, if you said, Jeff, I want to get this vein that's running right above my junk, that leads right up to my 8 pack, I'd say, okay now you just asked me for about a nine or ten. So, your goal is actually very achievable here, I recommend doing this: Look for about a 20% decrease in the amount of calories you're consuming right now. You don't have to get there all by consuming less calories, if you want to supplement with a little bit of cardio, you can do that. But the fact is nutrition is going to be the fastest and most effective way to get there. Now, the obvious thing is to do a first round sweep and say, what's the obvious shit I need to take out of my diet? Am I drinking too much? Am I eating fried foods too often? Am I eating out at restaurants too often where I know I'm not eating well? The fact is you make the changes that, you know, you can probably make without much effort. Here's the other good news. Because of the way men's store body fat, you actually don't have to be so damn good. Perfect is certainly not necessary when we're trying to decrease body fat on our chest. And here's why. In men, we tend to store body fat centrally. So again, we store all over and we add it in all places, all times, but we sort of do so in a bit of an ascending way. Right. We start here most stubbornly at the lower belly and then we kind of working through the abdomen and up to the love handles. And again, that kind of works its way up. Right. You've seen guys who have maybe a four pack, they get a little fatter, then it becomes a two pack, they get fatter and then that chest that was kind of already covered in some fat gets even worse and worse. Right. It's the proportionate rate at which we add fat, you're adding it everywhere, but it gets worse and worse the more and more fat you add to your body and the higher the body fat levels go.",

        "text": "Well, here's some good news. When you go into reverse and you're trying to lose weight, you actually lose it as a last time first off scenario. So, most guys, when they start to make even some minor improvements in their nutrition, start to lose fat on the way down. So, you start to see the chest look better. They start to see that two pack, they start to see the four pack again. You're losing it everywhere. But proportionally, you start to lose weight a little bit faster in the places, as you put it on the most recently. And that, again, points to chest fat. So, you don't have to be so strict in what you're doing. So, if you make that reduction and you start doing what I'm telling you here, guys, get honest with yourself, I promise you the fat will start to drop off. But then again, what happens then? What do you have underneath it? And that brings us to step number three, and this is something you could actually do at the same time, you're working on improving nutrition. Because if you get step two right, at some point, we're going to know what's going on underneath there. Because if it doesn't look good and you have no actual chest muscle development, then you're still going to have a problem because you're going to look like this. And that's not what you're looking for. So, you want to do is you get that body fat down but now we have to make sure that we develop the muscle that's underneath. And there's a specific way that we want to attack this and if you're going to do it more scientifically. What do we do? Well, we have to choose the right exercise. Now, ideally, guys, I would encourage you to get an overall training plan. Because I know if you're adopting this as a lifestyle, your long-term outlook is going to be better than someone that's just sort of intermittently hitting the gym. And when that plan consists of not just chest exercises, but let's say big compound lifts like deadlifts, squats, rows and the bench press, well you have a better ability to develop more muscle mass overall that's going to benefit you metabolically in terms of the number of calories that you burn at rest, so staving off fat accumulation is going to be a lot easier. However, we do have some exercises that if you're not going to do anything but just a few things, then let's start working on some of these chest exercises that incorporates a little bit more targeted effort towards the lower abdominal head fibers of the pec major. We know we can do that by simply following the fibers, I say it all the time. You want to take your arm from a position up high and move it down low because we know the fibers of the abdominal head run in this direction. Well, we have some options. The first thing is to actually take a high to low cross over with a simple band anchor to a pull up bar in your doorway at home. And what this does is it gives us a chance to get a good complete chest contraction because we want to get our arm not just down, but down and across midline. We could take push up variations and modify them as well.",

        "text": "And the incline push up is preferable because it gives us a chance to, again, take that arm from a high to low position. You can see, as I look at it from the side. Now, what we do here is add an additional plus to the top of this. This gives you a chance to work this serratus activation into this, which is a muscle that kind of supports the chest activity from below. The third thing we could do here is take that same exercise and just simply add a twist. And all this is doing is, again, incorporating some more of the adduction to the exercise that we didn't have from the straight standard incline push up plus. And again, all we have to do here is simply twist our body this time, which gives us the same relative adduction of the arm across the chest. The next two exercises, well, the first one is just a classic. We know that the basic dip is one of the best ways to target the lower fibers of the pec major. The problem is sometimes it's a little bit too difficult for some people because they have to command their own body weight here in space. And if you're at that sort of heavier weight in higher body fat percentage, you might find this a little bit challenging. So, you simply incorporate a band if needed, to unweight some your body weight and start to crank out these reps. And of course, you can always do these at home and the corner of a kitchen counter and if need be, put one foot down to simply unweight some of your body weight. And then finally, we have another option we could do here with the band anchored to the pull up bar in your doorway in a simply call the reverse lateral. Instead of taking your arm out to the side and raising it like you would in a lateral raise for your shoulders, you now take your arm from the top and pull it down into your side, that's part of the exercise. At this point now we push down as hard as we can, incorporating a little bit more of that plus. Any of these exercises are great options, guys. But again, if I had a choice, I push you in the direction of making sure you start with a foundation of a good program and then sprinkle these in accordingly. And that brings us to step number four. And this is the one that I said might surprise you because this is something you can change right now. Like literally watching this video you can make this change. You ready? Stop slumping over. If your posture sucks, I don't care what level of development your chest has right now, it's going to look worse. The reason for this is the chest is designed with an attachment in the shoulder to be a broad muscle that stands at attention. And as soon as you allow that shoulder to be brought in either chronically because you have really tight muscles in the front of your body, not just the chest, but the lats can be contributing as well. That makes your shoulders round forward and creates a smaller looking, saggier looking chest. Well, you need to do something about it. It could be as simple as being aware of the problem. Simply standing up and rolling those shoulders back allows that chest to look more of what",

        "text": "it's intended to look like. Now, I have an entire video dedicated to how to fix a chronically rounded shoulder posture. I'm going to link that for you in this video. But the awareness right here, right now of realizing that this is contributing to your problem is important. And it's one that I don't want to miss when it comes to the overall attack plan for fixing your problem once and for all. And then you have a guy who's a step-by-step game plan for getting rid of not only that ugly chest fat, but more importantly, those derogatory terms aimed at you in the process. Guys, I never want you to have to look in the mirror again and not like what you see. Especially as I mentioned here before, it's not as difficult as you may have thought it was if you do the right things. If you're looking to take it to another level, guys, you want to step-by-step plan, including a meal plan, we include them with all of our programs over at athleanx.com.
