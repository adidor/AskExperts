But I’m really not. He works really, really hard. But touchdown choreography? I never saw that coming at all. JESSE: All right. So, I love the touchdown celebrations, but I think you need something new. ANTONIO: Okay, show me. All right. What do have? Show me them moves. JESSE: The snorkel. ANTONIO: The snorkel? JESSE: A classic. Just like the monkey. ANTONIO: Oh, yeah. Shake it. JESSE: Or, my personal favorite, the sprinkler. ANTONIO: Oh, the sprinkler? JESSE: Really chop it on the way back. ANTONIO: How about something for ATHLEANX? JESSE: Oh, what if you get, like, the “X”, back, and then flex? Let me see you try it. ANTONIO: The X, flex. JESSE: Love it. Yeah. That’s the way – that’s it. ANTONIO: Like that? JESSE: That’s it. Right there. ANNOUNCER: Antonio Brown, stepping into the end zone for the Pittsburg Steelers’ touchdown. JEFF: That’s just raw, natural talent. I mean, you can’t teach that. What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. Today I want to talk to you- JESSE: And six, and seven, and- JEFF: Jesse. Jesse! JESSE: Yeah? JEFF: I’m doing a video. JESSE: Oh. Sorry, man. JEFF: Can you do your rotator cuff work somewhere else? JESSE: Oh, I’m not doing rotator cuff work. I’m actually choreographing Antonio Brown’s next touchdown celebration. JEFF: Oh my God. Can you get behind the camera, man?",

        "text": "JESEE: Yep. But you know what? Trust me. You’ll see this one on Sunday. JEFF: Guys, I don’t know what to do with him. What I do know is, there is always room for rotator cuff work. Whether or not he knew he was doing it. The fact is, there is something you should be doing for your shoulders. You guys know how much I value face pulls, how much I value the rotator cuff because I know how imperative it is to the function of your shoulder. Anyone who has issues with their shoulder can tell you that sometimes, even the easy act of raising our arm up over your head in a regular press, or side lateral raise, or a regular shoulder workout becomes very, very challenging. It doesn’t have to be. The one warmup I’m going to show you here, you’ve probably never tried before. I’m telling you, it's going to go a long way toward making your shoulders feel way better, no matter what you’re about to attack and do in your shoulder workout. So, here’s the move. This is a combination of a few different things. Number one: you’re going to see elements of a hammer curl. You’re going to see elements of a side-lateral raise when the elbow is bent. And you’re going to see elements of a “W” raise that I’ve done here before at the very top. But the idea is that it’s actually making the rotator cuff work in conjunction with the other muscles of the shoulder girdle to warmup your shoulder for elevation. And it’s helping a lot of people that have that notable, painful arc when they raise their shoulder over their head. Meaning, if you have a shoulder impingement – which is a commonality that comes from training and developing imbalances in the muscles of your shoulder girdle – you don’t necessarily have pain in this first 30 or so degrees in motion. You raise your arm up over here, there’s no pain. It starts about here. You raise your arm up, it gets up to about here, it really hurts, and all of a sudden you get some relief and your arm goes up over your head. Well, the issue here is that we want to be able to strengthen what’s going on in here. What’s mainly going on here – and the reason you’re getting impingement in this area – is because you have an overactive deltoid that’s pulling the humeral head upward, into an impinged position without the counterbalance and counteraction of the forces of the rotator cuff pulling that down. Or centralizing the head of the humerus inside the glenoid. Meaning, you’re keeping your shoulder in the middle of the socket as your arm raises up. If it doesn’t migrate up, then you don’t get that impingement. So, what we want to do is keep it in there. The only way we can do that is through the activation of those important rotator cuff muscles at the right time. What we do with this exercise is, you can see me break it down now. As I curl this up, again, I’ll not first that I’m doing it in a hammer curl position, not with a supination. Why?",

        "text": "Because if you do have additional issues in your shoulder – like a labrum tear, where we know that the longhead of the bicep attaches to the labrum itself – tension in the biceps in this position could cause a little bit of pulling and discomfort. So, we can eliminate that, simply by changing the position of our forearms here into a more neutral grip, to disengage the biceps a bit more, allowing the brachialis and the brachial radialis to take over that flexion. That’s the first thing. The second thing is, we can go into this abduction. As I’m starting to abduct and let my elbows leave the sides of my body, going up toward 90 degrees, this is the action that causes the problem when we have impingement. But at the same time, I’m doing that, you can see I’m doing this external rotation of the shoulder. I’m getting this abduction with external rotation to put me up at the top. That is the key. I’m getting the activation of the muscles – the rotator cuff – at the moment I need them most. What will happen is, as I get to the top, if I have a slight lean in my torso forward, just enough to be against gravity at the top so the dumbbells are actually doing something, I feel a really, really good tension throughout my shoulder girdle. But no strain. No pain. Just good tension. So, you want to perform this, guys. I’m telling you. All you need to do is one or two sets of 10 to 15 repetitions, using about 2/3 of what you’d normally use for a side-lateral raise. Your shoulders are going to feel absolutely amazing. If you get popping, if you get grinding, if you get some of that pain as you raise your arm up; all that will go away and it’s going to make your shoulder workout much more productive that day. And if you keep this up regularly, it’s going to do a whole hell of a lot to make your shoulders feel better from here on out. Guys, I hope you’ve found this video helpful. In the meantime, if you’re looking for a program that puts the science back in strength like we always do here, all our programs do that. They’re all available over at ATHLEANX.com. If you haven’t already subscribed, please do so to make sure you never miss a video from us. I’ve got to go back and try to figure out what – Jesse, were you actually trying to teach Antonio Brown what his next dance is going to be? JESSE: Yeah! Of course, I was! I’m telling you. You’re going to see it. JEFF: Guys, we’ll be back here again in just a few days. See you.",
