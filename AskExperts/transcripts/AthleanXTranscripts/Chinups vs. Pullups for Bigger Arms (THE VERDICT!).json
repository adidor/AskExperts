        "text": "What s up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com.  So, if I had to limit you to just one exercise   to build bigger arms and your choice was  a pull up as shown here. I m going to let   you see it from every angle front and  back or a chin-up, as shown here again,   front and back. Which one of them would you do if  you wanted to build bigger arms? As always, guys   are going to do what we do here are going to put  the science back in strength and going to break   out a muscle marker to help us to make the right  decision. Now, I'm going to start with one of the   exercises. Which one should we do, Jesse?  Chin-ups!   Chin-ups. Okay, with the chin-up guys,  we re talking about that underhand grip   variation where you pull yourself up to the bar.  Well, what do we get instantly? We know that we   get better bicep activation, right? Because if I  take my arm just like this and I turn this form   over into the supinated position, you can see the  biceps work just by doing that. So, we know we're   going to get better engagement of the biceps  for doing that. But before you rush and say,   well, there's the one, that's the one that's  going to build the bigger biceps, better arms,   here we go. Hold on a second because we don't  just do this, in order to get the chin-up into   position, we have to do this too. You can see that when I bring my arm   into this position, I instantly do something  else. I get a better activation of the lats.   The reason for that is that I'm getting more of  a stretch placed on the lats by taking the two   attachment points further away from each other.  This can tend to give people better recruitment   of the lats and actually, sometimes, dominate  the contribution of the biceps. How do we fix   that? If we're going to do an underhand chin-up  we want to make sure that we give ourselves a   chance to actually curl ourselves up to the  bar as opposed to just pulling ourselves   directly up. When you pull yourself directly  up you re going to favor more of the lats.    If you want to use this as an arm builder,  you're going to want to do this instead.   You pretend like you're curling your body to  the bar the same way that you would curl a bar   up to your body in a traditional barbell curl.  And when we do that, you can see that we get   better activation and recruitment of the biceps,  which turns us into a tremendous biceps builder.   But we're not done yet, and I haven't even used  the muscle marker yet because there's another   muscle in your arm that you're going to want  to build up if you want to have bigger arms.   And no, it's not the triceps, it doesn't  work the triceps. We're talking about   this muscle right here, and it's the brachialis.  You can see that when I go like this and I pull   my arm in as I'm pulling up into a pull up,  you can see that this muscle here pops out.   That is what the muscle marker here is for.  You can see right in this area here, right?   That muscle in there, which crosses the elbow, is  called the brachialis. That is going to give us a   lot of width on the arm, which is going to fill  up those shirtsleeves, making it a tremendous   arm builder. But you have to do this right too.  You don't do a typical wide grip pull up.    Instead, what you do is you want to narrow up  that grip because you can see if the brachialis   is a flexor of the elbow and my arms are wide  like that and I pull down, I only get a limited   amount of flexion at the elbow. But if I were to  go narrower, look at how much more flexion I get   in the elbow. Therefore, the narrow grip is going  to set us up for more success in terms of building   the brachialis. Now how do we pull up to the bar?  That matters too. You don't want to close down and   go all the way up tight to the bar when you do  this if it s your brachialis is that you want   to build. You want to maintain a little bit of  distance so you could keep this 90 degree angle   because you can see once again that when I  come in here in this position and I have my   brachialis engaged, if I were to go and continue  to pull it close, close down this angle, I start   to lose some of that activation, right?  I got good activation there and as I get   a little bit closer, I lose it. You want to  maintain that distance relationship from the bar   if you want to get the brachialis to be built up  bigger and stronger. So, what's the answer? Well,   the answer is, good thing we have to choose  one thing, the answer is both of them. How   would you do both of them, no matter what split  your following right now? If you're following a   bro split, I would consider the brachialis  exercise to be more of the pull up. Okay,",

        "text": "and that would go on our back day, and I consider  the chin-up to be the better bicep exercise if   you performed it the way that I showed you and  that would sort of go on bicep or arm day.    Now, if we're doing a traditional pull workout,  then of course you can put them either in   alternating workouts to one day you're working the  chin-up, and the next time you do your workout,   you're working the pull up. Or you can actually  use them together in the same workout, with one   being the focus of the strength lift, meaning,  let's say, a weighted pull up. And then you use   your chin-up as a higher rep accessory exercise  provided you actually can bang out quite a few   reps with chin-ups. You can actually use a  band if needed for some assistance there.   Or you can certainly fit this in in a total  body workout scheme where you're doing this   every single time you're training, either  the pull up or the chin-up. Again optimally   kind of waiting there so you can help with  that progressive overload to build either   of those muscles you're trying to grow.  The fact is, guys, both of them are great   exercises. How you do what you do always matters.  Now you know how to do that.
