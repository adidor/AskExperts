        "text": "What's up, guys, Jeff Cavaliere, athleanx.com.   So there's one question that I have been asked  more than any other over the last 10 years   is, Jeff, how do you stay as lean as you do  all year around? You literally never change.   Well, I take that as a compliment, but  honestly, it comes down to the way that   I approach nutrition. You see, there's no deals  with the devil. I didn't promise my firstborn son.   I don't take TRT. I don't take any drugs I never  have in my entire life. There's nothing that I   do special except my special ability, I guess, to  stay incredibly consistent with my nutrition.    Because quite frankly, I've talked about it in the  past, I don't even really do cardio. I do enough   just to maintain some shape and to focus a little  bit on my heart, but I don't do nearly as much as   I should, but it's certainly not a factor in how  I remain as lean as I do. It all comes through my   nutrition. Now that being said, people say, Well,  Jeff, I know that, and I've watched your full day   of eating video, but maybe you can update  that for us. You can make another one.     Well, guess what? It would be a pretty boring  video because it's going to be the same   exact information that I gave you back then. As  matter of fact, the same thing pretty much that   I'm eating. And it's the fact that I can have that  consistency that I believe leads me to the levels   of body fat that I demonstrate consistently.  However, there is a system and the system   that's in place here is what is allowing me to do  that all the time and to remain as lean as I do.   So I want to share that exact system with you here  today so you can actually start to do the same.   Now that being said, depending upon what your  desired level of leanness is, it's going to be   either easier or more difficult to actually get to  where I'm at. And that's a good thing because not   all of us want to be Jeff Cavaliere lean, it might  not suit you or your purposes in life. As a matter   of fact, a lot of us feel much more comfortable  in the mid teen range and body fat levels,   and they want to stay there. And the good news  is you're not going to have to be as consistent   as what I'm showing you here, but the rules  will still help you out to a great degree.   If you want to get even leaner than that somewhere  in between, again, you're just going to have to   sort of up the ante on your consistency, but  you're not going to have to veer away from the   rules. So no matter where you want to be in terms  of your level of leanness, you're going to be able   to apply exactly what I show you here today. All right, so first up here I'd like to think   is the cornerstone of how I do things, because  if you can't do this, it's never going to work.   And that is, you need to eat what you like.  Notice I didn't say eat whatever you like,   because that's not the way we play this game. In  order to get lean, you're going to have to have   smarter nutritional choices. You're going  to have to have foods that are a little bit   lower in caloric density, but higher and nutrient  value and my diet is filled with those selections.   But it's not perfect, as you'll see again, if  you watch that full day of eating video.    However, you need to find the foods that are going  to fit into that criteria that you still really,   really like. Because if you're forcing foods into  your daily meal plan, you're never going to be   able to stick to that plan for the long term, so  it's never going to become a lifestyle. For me,   there's not a single food that I put in my body  every day that I don't thoroughly enjoy. And I   mean that. I thoroughly enjoy every food that  I eat, if I didn't, I couldn't maintain that   consistency. And there are so many food options  out there that make this job so much easier.   And not just foods, but the way that we put  them together, the recipes, how we eat them,   how we prepare them. You can make any food  incredibly enjoyable, you just have to   experiment and take the time to find those  foods that you like. Because when you do,   the whole deprivation basis of a diet is no  longer there. There's no longer the period   of being on the diet that ultimately ends  off the diet. And that is where you start,   because if you don't like what you eat,  you can't eat what you're eating.    The next thing you have to do is pick an approach  and stick with it. And again, there are a lot of   different approaches here, some that I agree with,  some I don't really agree with at all. However,   if you're able to take an approach and stick  with it and have consistency for the long term,   I'm talking year after year after year because  that's the only acceptable form for me,",

        "text": "then by all means, continue to do that. I'm  not a believer in keto. However, if you can   eat that way and that has worked for you, then  go ahead and eat that way. I'm not forcing you   into my method, but since this video is about  my methods, I'll share with you what I did.    I went the low-fat approach, and the reason  why I did that was for two reasons. Number one,   I realized that the caloric density of fats on a  gram per gram basis was more than twice as much as   proteins and carbohydrates. Secondly, I realized  that at the time I had a lot of fat in my diet.   So what I did was make the easy cut. I always  urge you guys to make the cut that you think   might be the easiest to make. But what I did was  make a giant mistake here because I went to the   extreme. I figured less fat is better than  a lot of fat, and no fat is even better than   some fat. And that was a big mistake because  I went all the way down to pretty much the   no fat level and my body paid for it.  I wasn't able to stay warm, even in the sunshine,   I had problems with my vision. I talked about  all these things before photosensitivity,   I went to the extreme and I paid for it. So what  I did was what a smart person would do, I hope,   is make some modifications back in the other  direction. And I gradually added fat back in,   but not to the levels I did before. And because  again, the caloric density of the foods that I   was replacing those fats with was less, I was  able to create that caloric deficit needed to   get to a leaner, body fat level. I urge you again  to find the method that works for you, but again,   if you're looking for the one, that might be the  easiest to do if your diet's already high in fat,   that's the one I'm going to suggest you do.  And so the next rule here is one that I believe   is very important for my success, and it can  do the same thing for you. And that is I eat   at specific times during the day. I eat around  the clock or based upon the clock. And no, it has   nothing to do with optimizing the anabolic window,  which is another thing we learned a long time ago   doesn't really exist. However, what it does is  it provides a level of consistency because I eat   only during specific times, each and every day and  not outside of those times. And the consistency   comes because it prevents me from eating for  any other reason other than it's time to eat.   Now it just so happens that my body has built  up to a point where I am hungry every time those   windows of time open up and come around. However,  I'm not eating because I'm hungry throughout the   rest of the day. And oftentimes we just eat when  we're hungry, and that opens up a Pandora's Box   because we know when we just do that, we become  grazers and grazers, become big calorie consumers   and trying to get into a deficit is very difficult  when you're mindlessly grazing. Not to mention the   fact that a lot of us confuse hunger for a lot  of different things. Even thirst can make someone   feel hungry and if you're eating every time  you're thirsty, you're doing the wrong thing.    So what I do is I pick a window in the morning.  Again, they are about half hour windows somewhere   in the morning for breakfast, a mid-morning  time, a lunch time, a mid-afternoon time,   a nighttime, and then once again, my  last meal of the day, which is dinner.   That being said, I never eat outside of those  times because I don't want to allow myself to   become susceptible to any other emotion or feeling  or craving. And by becoming mechanical about it,   I'm also a lot more prepared for my meals  throughout the day. So if I'm not going to   be in the office or if I'm going to be out  and about, I can plan ahead and make sure   that I have the meals available to me or a  place that I can get the meals available to   me that are going to allow me to eat and  stay consistent with how I do things.    Now ironically, this is actually similar  to something like intermittent fasting.   Not at all in terms of the biochemistry  and the hormonal reactions that occur   from a six-hour eating window throughout a 24-hour  day. But because the rules are in place, I am   confined to these specific eating periods that  allow me to maintain this consistency that keeps   me on track and prevents the overage that would  occur if I was eating outside these windows.    Which brings me to my fourth rule here, and  that is the institution of more eating periods   throughout the day. I already mentioned that  mid-morning and mid-afternoon eating period, not   everybody does that. But what happens is if you're  going to eat by the clock and you're going to try   to stay consistent, you're going to find that  hunger may wind up beating you. In other words,",

        "text": "the hunger may wind up eclipsing your ability to  withstand till that next time period of eating.   And to overcome that, you simply institute another  eating period. I didn't start off by eating that   many times during the day. I started off, like  everybody else, breakfast, lunch and dinner.    But when I started to realize that I was  consistently having that mid-morning craving   and instead of just mindlessly eating throughout  that period, every time I started to get a little   bit hungry at 9:30 at 10:15 at 11:00 at 11:45,  I confined it to that rule of eating within that   period of the mid-morning snack and everything  went away. To the point where, as I said,   my body became accustomed to that time period, and  now I don't find myself getting hungry until that   time period. Remember, you just ate at, let's  say, 8:30 or 9:00 in the morning whenever your   breakfast was, you're not going to be immediately  hungry. So we're only talking about the ability   to withstand maybe 30 or 45 minutes of hunger.  But when that next eating window is approaching   and you don't have to wait all the way till  lunch, it's going to set you up for success.    So those four simple rules forming the basis  of how I eat, the question oftentimes becomes,   But Jeff, how do you break the rules? When do  you break the rules? When is your cheat day?   And see guys I already talked about it many times  on this channel before, there is no cheat day for   me. Cheat meals, you know, again a couple of  times a year, once a year for my carrot cake.   I don't have the cravings for the cheat  meals. And what cheat meals are implying   is that you're departing from the restrictions on  the ordinary meals that you're eating. You see,   there's an instant comparison between your cheat  meals being the ones that are much more enjoyable   and the meals you're eating every day being not so  enjoyable. But if you go back to rule number one,   I made you pick the foods that are incredibly  enjoyable to you from the very beginning.   And when you form the basis of your eating  plan around those incredibly enjoyable foods,   you're not going to feel the need to have  cheat meals as often. But we talk about again,   what is your desired level of leanness, because  that matters. If your desired level of leanness   is to be in the mid-teens and look damn good  in the process, well, you're going to find the   ability to have your cheat meals more often. As a  matter of fact, the cheat days can actually exist   at that level. And that might give you the sanity  that you need to stay consistent. Because again,   consistency is the key and consistency can  occur at all the different levels of body fat.   Remaining consistently in your mid-teens and  body fat levels is a good thing, and if you   have to do that through the use of cheat days  or cheat meals, then by all means do it. If   you have to do that through a different style of  eating, they all end up in caloric restriction,   then do that as long as you can stick with it  for the long term. Guys, the point is how you   eat will determine how you look. If you can  get your nutrition in check, you're going to   be able to get your body fat down to a leaner  level. How lean you want to go is up to you.   The more you want it to be lean, the more you're  going to have to sort of set these rules in place   and stick with them a little bit of varying  here, and there are going to be able to still   allow you to look damn good without having  to get so extreme. But I will tell you this,   the more that you can stick to the rules,  the easier sticking to the rules becomes.   That's what rules are there for in the first  place. When the rules are in place and you don't   allow yourself to veer outside those rules, your  life becomes a lot more consistently predictable.   And when it's consistently predictable, your  ability to look a certain way is going to be   that much easier. At that point, guys, it's up  to you to what level you want to do it to.   If you're looking for that video again,  how I break down exactly what I eat,   you can find that here. If you're looking for a  meal plan that reflects exactly how I eat from   a day-to-day basis, you can find it in our  Athlean-X Programs at athleanx.com. If you   find the video helpful.
