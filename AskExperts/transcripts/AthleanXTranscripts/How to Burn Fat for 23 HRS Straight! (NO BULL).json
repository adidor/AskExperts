        "text": "What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com.  What I hold in my hands here today is the secret   for you to burn fat for 23 hours straight every  single day that you apply this. The fact is, guys,   it's a lot easier than you may have thought  so. The point, however, is that you have to   do exactly what I tell you, that's our deal. So,  what I want you to do is before I reveal this,   I want you to take out a pen and paper and copy  down exactly what I tell you to do. It starts   with a quick workout, just five exercises.  The first thing up is this one right here, three   sets of 10 of Table Push Aways. Now, guys, this  is an incredibly effective move for your triceps.   As a matter of fact, it works incredibly well as  a superset with something called jaw clenching.   If you just keep your mouth closed around food, it  will work really, really well. The next exercise   is actually just eight repetitions, but still  three sets is called the Refrigerator Row.   And once again, here, this works  incredibly well. Now is based on   the weight of your refrigerator door, so  it depends on how strong you are and how   many of these you're going to be able to do. But  generally, three sets of eight is the best.    The next exercise is actually programmed to be  explosive. If you find yourself around soda,   we call these Soda Spit Outs. As you  can see here, just one done explosively.   The next exercise is something we call the  Pantry Put Away. Now, if you already have   learned to put the foods, you shouldn't have  all the way on the top shelf, do you actually   experience the benefits of this exercise? But  for those that have it, it's a great total   body move. It works your core, your balance, your  shoulders, and don't forget your calves, too.    And then finally, guys, we have this one, no  good workout should end without this exercise,   it's called the Spoon Drop. And of  course, the only way to really do this one   is one set to failure. And with that, if you  just follow that for 23 hours straight, guys,   you will have success if you believe in that.  See, guys, I've said it before, I'll say it again.   If you want to actually lose weight, if you want  to burn fat, you're going to have to find a way   to be hypercaloric. That means nutrition.  It has nothing to do with your workout.    And oftentimes people will focus on their ability  to get to the gym and be proud of themselves,   as you should be, for commitment you've made to  get to the gym and do your workout. But one hour   is not enough because when you realize how much  is left in the rest of the day to screw this up,   that's where the problem comes. Now, if you're a  visual learner, let me show to you in a different   way. These bars here on the screen, these blue  bars are 24 of them, those represent the number of   hours in a day. This little white bar right here,  that's your workout. Congratulations. Like I said,   it's a big achievement to be able to  do that and be consistent with it.   But look at what's left here -- a fuck ton of blue  bars. This is the problem. You could do everything   right in that white bar and screw everything up  for the rest of the day. You're not going to be   where you want to be. Now, I realize that some  of that's going to be occupied by sleep. So,   let's say eight hours of sleep. There are your  eight bars and there's a white bar still for   your workout. What's left now? A little bit less  than a fuck ton of blue bars, but it's still a lot   of blue bars. So, what I'm going to do is going to  make sure that you do nail this every single time,   because in reality, guys, I'm going to give  you the truth here. And we call them realities.   There's three realities that you get these right.  You're going to make sure that you set off on a   path that you're never going to turn back from  and you're going be able to do this with ease.    The first reality is that not all  healthy foods are low calorie foods. Now,   I know this comes in sometimes is a  shock because people will say, listen,   I have changed the way I'm eating. I have salad  every day, I have olive oil, I have avocados,   I have nuts, I have all-natural peanut butter,  I have granola. Yeah, great. You've chosen a   whole bunch of calorie dense foods. Though they're  healthy, maybe not granola, but they're healthy.   The fact is, you're not making any wiser choices.  Your ability to become hypercaloric, to actually   lose fat or lose weight is pretty much not  going to happen there because you haven't chosen   properly. You need to choose beyond just good  foods to choose foods that are smarter in terms   of their calorie density. Choose foods that are  less calorie dense to be able to make these actual",

        "text": "leaps in terms of cutting your calories down.  But it doesn't end there because we could talk   about the opposite to that. Not all low-calorie  foods are healthy. However, don't use that one   on me. Don't use that on me because I have  a real bugaboo about this. While I agree   that foods that are laden with sugar substitutes  or artificial flavorings and things like that are   not necessarily long-term healthy food options,  there are a very important bridge for people that   are making that transition from eating totally  unhealthy to eating healthier. Just think about   it yourself. If you wanted to go from that Whopper  that you have all the time down to chicken breast,   if you tried to make that change like that, your  chances of success are pretty much zero.    Why is that? Because it's too big of a leap. So,  if you wanted to make that sort of midway jump,   you went down to a turkey burger, it's a step in  the right direction. Maybe that turkey burgers got   all. Is the stuff synthetically injected into  it, but again, we're talking short term use,   short term use, so that you can use that time  to make the change, to start to see the results   that motivate you to continue down that path, to  eventually get to the chicken breast. But if you   try to go to the chicken breast too soon  and you fall off the wagon because you   hate the way it tastes and it's too  big of a departure from your Whopper,   then you're setting yourself up for failure.  And you can take it a step further, too, because   you can take the Coca-Cola and go from Coke to  Diet Coke. And a lot of people I will never have   a Diet Coke because of the artificial sweeteners  in it. Again, guess what? Your transition is going   to be ultimately towards water, but you can't get  there from coke to water, but you can probably get   there from Coke to Diet Coke down to water. And  I'll tell you one thing that you need to remember,   you know what's the only thing more  unhealthy than the artificial sweeteners?   Its remaining overweight or even worse, obese.  That's the number one thing that's going to   damage you in the long run.  So, you've got to do something.   And it's a reality that you have to face. And if  you do it, I promise you there will be success   on the other side of it. Which puts you in a  reality number three, and this is a good one,   because this is where we actually get to  level the playing field for everybody and   make sure that this works for everybody, because  I promise you, this will work every single time.   And that is not all 23 hours have  to look the same from day to day,   and they certainly don't have to look the same  from person to person. You're 23 hours and what   you do with them certainly does not have to look  like my 23 hours and what I do with mine.    Because I'll tell you this, my 23 hours, whether  you look at them on January 2nd, on February 20th   or on June 19th, are going to look the same every  single time. But it comes down to goals. What are   your goals? Maybe you don't want to walk around  at almost cadaver level body fat levels like me   year-round. That's what I do, this is what my  channel is, I'm Athlean-X, this is what I do.   But you don't have to do that because I'm telling  you right now, 10% body fat is going to make you   look so damn good. And depending upon where you  are right now, how far away from that you can look   really, really good from what you look like right  now. And it doesn't require that you get this   right all the time. I always say you don't have  to be perfect to be great. If anybody out there   follows the NBA, you know, Steph Curry is pretty  damn great. Well, Steph Curry is third all-time   and three point shot percentage, he shoots  43%. That means he misses six out of every   10 shots he takes. He misses more than he makes,  but it doesn't prevent him from being great.    Well, guess what, if you apply this same thought  process to how you eat, it can go a long, long way   to you being great. Because if you realize that  you're, let's say, eat four or five times a day,   that means there's 28 to 35 meals that you're  going to have in a given week. You do not need   to go 35 for 35 or 28 for 28 to be great. Now  you can't go and bat 400 because that means you   can be messing up a lot more, when it comes to  nutrition it's going to matter a lot more. But   you don't have to be perfect. You can mix in the  cheat meal from time to time. As a matter of fact,   you can actually string them together four or  five and a week, go 30 for 35 and string them   together in a day and make it a cheat day.  But I'm going to give you a word of caution on   this, because I talked about this before. Your  ability to rebound from a cheat day and get back",

        "text": "on track and remain perfect for the rest of  the week, because that's what we have to do,   is actually sort of a long shot, especially if  you're struggling with your nutrition right now.   I don't advise people to use it as a cheat day.  If you want sprinkling a cheat meal here or there,   that's a better option. But the reality is that  the long-term success never did and never will   rely on you being perfect. And when you let go of  that, you realize that damn good doesn't require   perfection or even near perfection, then that's  when it all starts to become a lot more exciting.   And that's what becomes a lot more doable because  you have an end goal. You know how to get there   and you actually start to work towards it.  And the other reality is that I share with you,   yes, guys, your food choice matters and how  you get there. You've got to become a little   bit more educated about it because that holds  the key to your success. But with this video,   guys, I hope you have both the motivation  and now a little bit of that knowledge to   make that next step, make that good next  step, that right next step to put you on   the path to getting where I know you're going  to be. The 23 hours is what matters guys.    I congratulate you on the other hour, keep working  at that, but work more diligently on getting the   other twenty three hours right and I promise  you, that's where the long term success will be.   If you're looking guys for programs, we map out  all of it, the workouts and the other 23 hours,   what you're supposed to do and what you're  supposed to eat. I've got it all mapped out in all   of our programs it's over at Athleanx.com.  If you found the video helpful and hopefully   truthful, guys, make sure you leave your  comments and thumbs up below. Let me know   what you struggle with and maybe we can do  future videos on those as well.
