This machine right here   is lying to you. But it's not just this one,  so is this one and this one and even this one.   See guys is you re using a treadmill or any  cardio machine right now to determine the amount   of calories you re burning to help you in your  goal to lose more weight, you're not getting the   right math. You're being lied to. The number  of calories that you're burning are just not   accurate. Today I'm going to show you not only the  worst of the worst, but also I'm going to tell you   the machines that are maybe better worth your  time than others. It's time for the truth.    But the first truth that needs to be  told is if you're using your cardio   as a way to create your caloric deficit, to  lose weight, you're making a big mistake.   Because you're never going to be able to outrun  a bad diet, we talk about it all the time. Even   just one slip up in a meal is enough to race an  hour's worth of effort at the gym. You need to   make sure that when you're trying to lose weight,  your efforts are focused first and foremost   on cleaning up the foods that you're eating  right now. Make your caloric cuts there and use   the additional cardio to supplement those efforts.  And that's where the real results will happen.    So, the first thing you have to be on the lookout  for is how these things are actually asking you   for the information, because if they're not asking  for your weight directly, then they're not giving   you an accurate result. Because we know that  cardio machines need to know how much you weigh.   A heavier person has to work harder to move their  body through space and therefore can burn more   calories. Whereas somebody that's lighter is going  to burn less calories for the same activity.    Well, what happens with these cardio machines  is they calculate that calorie burn based off of   something called a MET M-E-T which is a metabolic  equivalent. And essentially one MET is the value   of you sitting on the couch doing nothing. The  calories that you would burn by literally just   sitting down watching TV. And anything you  did that increased your activity beyond that   is going to be some multiple of that number. So,  if you went for a jog, you could have, let's say,   a three or four MET burn, which is three or  four times harder than sitting on your ass.   That being said, it's always calculated by  one bodyweight number, usually 154 pounds.   So, if you don't weigh 154 pounds, you're not  getting an accurate calorie output read back to   you. If you weigh less than that, then you're  actually overestimating how many calories you   burn and if you weigh more than that, you're  actually maybe underestimating by a little bit.   But don't worry, there's a lot of other  ways that these machines are screwing you.   I'm going to show you those, too.  Wait, isn't this your towel?   Oh, that's disgusting.  And one of them is by actually maybe   fudging the math intentionally. You see, a lot  of times the number that you read in terms of   the caloric burn is based on including something  called the REE or the Resting Energy Expenditure,   the calories that you would burn normally at rest.  So, let's say you're on the treadmill and it tells   you that you burned 420 calories. Well, what if  it's also including the fact that you would have   burned 100 calories if you did nothing at all?  Well, that's just inflating the overall number.   You only burn 320 extra calories. You're already  likely using that number in your base calculation   to determine how many calories you need to  burn during the day. It's just not fair.    So, you might be asking yourself, why would they  do such a thing? Well, maybe to make you think   this machine is amazing. And I would love to do  all my workouts on this machine. In a matter of   fact, I might want to buy one of these and put it  in my house because it makes me feel good about   the number of calories I'm burning. Just throwing  it out there. But let's not just blame the   machines entirely, because if you're doing what  I'm doing right now, you're screwing yourself.   If you've ever ridden a bike leaning this way,  your posture is creating less caloric burn. How?   Because you're doing less work. Leaning on the  machine, on weighting some of your body weight   is costing yourself some calories. Amazingly  so up to 50% less than what you thought you",

        "text": "were burning and that causes problems.  You can do it even on a treadmill. You've   probably seen it a million times or done it  yourself. You hold on with your hands or worse,   you lean forward. Or even on a Stairmaster any  attempt at all to try to weight any of your body   weight is a good indication that you're actually  looking for a way out. If you're going to do   your cardio, make sure you stand up straight  and do so with good posture, you're going to   get a lot closer to the number that you actually  thought you were burning in terms of calories.    Can I ask you a question? If you're going do bicep  curl, do you think you get better results doing   this or actually taking it through a full range of  motion all the way down and all the way up? Well,   it should come as no surprise the full range  of motion is better. But then why are you doing   this when you're doing cardio, you're cutting  your range of motion short often. For instance,   if you use a Stairmaster, or in this case, a Step  Mill, a lot of us take the option of taking short,   choppy steps. We don't drive the step all the way  down through full hip extension. What that means   is less work being done. And for you, let's  work means less calories and less calories   means less weight loss.  And look at even your choices,   like the elliptical machine. It's locking you into  an abbreviated range of motion. You can't extend   your leg for the back even if you wanted to.  And then even this, I'm sure you've seen people   who stand up while they're pedaling on a bike.  Now, this is not just some fancy peloton trick,   it's increasing the range of motion. You're  getting more hip extension also on unweighting   your body. Remember the more of your body weight  that you're bearing during the exercise. You're   doing, the more calories you're burning and  therefore getting better bang for your buck.    So, remember, if it feels easier, it is  easier. Instead, look to make it harder,   increase that range of motion. And with that  increased range of motion and work done,   you're going to find better overall success from  your time spent in the gym. All right, so if all   these cardio machines are lying to you, are there  at least some that are lying to you less? And the   answer is yes. And it starts with the stationary  bike. It's the most accurate overestimating   by only about 7%. And the reason for this is  oftentimes the way that we calculate the calories   burned here is through mathematical formulations  and based off of power output. In other words,   watts. And when we do that and we combine it with  our body weight, which most of these machines will   ask for, we get a much more accurate judgment. However, next up on the list is going to be   the Stairmaster. Here we're looking at about  a 12% overestimation on the number of calories   that you burn. But you've got to make sure, once  again, that you're not leaning on that machine,   like I said, and that you're taking those nice,  long, full range of motion steps. The next one up   down the list in terms of accuracy is going to  be the treadmill, which really isn't such good   news because so many people use this machine.  And the problem here is twofold. Number one,   the accuracy is now off by 13% to up to 20%. And  even if you do what I told you and keep your hands   off the handrails, sometimes you're still fighting  a losing battle here. Because the calibration of   the machine is a requirement to maintain its  accuracy and most gyms just don't calibrate the   machines often enough. So that's something you  can't even do anything about. And then finally,   the most inaccurate of them all is the elliptical  machine, sometimes off by as much as 42%,   mostly due to the fact that the range of motion  varies greatly between even different models.    Now, to put this all into real  world perspective, imagine this   if you spent 30 minutes on an elliptical machine,  you might be overestimating the number of calories   burned by 130. Now, think about that. If you're  trying to create your overall deficit for the day   and you think you've burned 130 calories more  than you did, therefore you could eat more food,   you're kind of setting yourself up for disaster.  Extrapolate this out for the entire year,   if you were to take 130 calories in extra over  your baseline rate every single day, that's a   14-pound weight gain by the end of the year.  Let's face it, we need to figure this out.    Or do we really? Because there's a few things you  could do right now that are actually going to just   nullify the inaccuracy of these machines and  still help you to get back on track in terms of   your weight loss. And the first thing is just to  choose a different machine because there are some",

        "text": "that are just way better at burning a lot more  calories. So even if they're off, you're still   burning a lot more than you are right now. And  the main key here is to integrate one that has   working arm movement, not just going along for the  ride, like on the elliptical, but actually working   and working hard. And one of the easiest ways  to do this is with an air bike, you could burn   about 20 to 25 calories for every single minute  that you're on this. The other option is to   use a rowing machine again, resisted upper body  movement as well as lower body movement here.   Obviously, when you use these guys, you know  how much more difficult they are. The difficulty   is going to be a dead giveaway in terms of the  effectiveness of the exercise. And finally, you   could use something like this ski ergometer or the  ski erg. The point is you have alternatives to the   standard cardio options that are ultimately going  to do a better job of helping you burn calories.   Yeah, I know they're not the most pleasant, but  at the end of the day, what matters is the work   that you do. And the more work you do, the more  calories you burn and ultimately, the more weight   you'll lose, so you got to consider it. But even  if you decide that you just want to stick to the   machine you're using right now, you want to find  ways to make it more accurate. What can you do?   Well, the first thing, as I mentioned, is to try  to find one at least allows you to input your body   weight. Because when you do, you're going to have  an infinitely closer accuracy when it comes to the   number of calories burned. But the other thing  I like to just recommend is throw a towel over   it and stop looking at the calories. Instead go  off of your respiratory rate. The more difficult   it is for you to carry on a conversation  during exercise, the more indicative it is   of the amount of effort you're putting forth. So, aim for more breathlessness. In other words,   whatever cardio machine you're using right now, if  you're more breathless, the next time you use it,   you're likely working harder and therefore  increasing your calorie burn. Or make it easy for   yourself and do what I advise my athletes to do.  Simply take the output that the machine gives you   and divide it in half and use that to calculate  your intake amounts for the day. Oh, and by the   way, don't rely on the wearable devices to try  to improve your reporting on your calorie output.   They're actually not much more helpful.  As a matter of fact, the best of them has shown   only a 20% inaccuracy, with the worst  one being actually 96% inaccurate. Yeah,   even a blind squirrel finds an acorn once in a  while. So, remember, if you're looking to lose   weight and cardio is part of your equation  here, at least make sure you're getting the   right numbers back.
