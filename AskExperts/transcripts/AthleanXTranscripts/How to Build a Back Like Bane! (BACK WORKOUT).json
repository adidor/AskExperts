        "text": "we're talking about weighted pull-ups or pull-ups go ahead which one are you doing now I get it maybe you say well I really can't do that many pull-ups in that case you're going to do pull-ups but let's say you could do at least 10 pull-ups at some point guys you gotta switch it up and especially if you're trying to build muscle here you got to start weighting it and I fell for this mistake a long time ago myself I just kept on working on getting more and more pull-ups to add to that top end number 20 25 28 instead limit your number to around 10 and just add weight accordingly so you can Overload at that rep range a lot of people don't do this and even if it's just adding a 10 pound plate here or even a 25 pound plate whatever it is try to start ramping up the weight in the load so you can fail in that range now you always have the option to do what Jesse's doing here which is perform as many as you can with some additional weight drop the weight and instantly go into a drop set of a bodyweight version it's a great way to do this but it's definitely a better way to do the pull-up if you want to start to build more of that thickness which leads us to the third exercise here when you're trying to build a back like Bane and this time your choice is going to be between a chest supported bro or a barbell row now I get it the barbell row is a great exercise I ranked it very high up on my list and my back exercises ranked video however there's an advantage that comes from performing the chest supported row when it's the band life back that you're looking for and we're going for here is limiting a little bit of that black involvement and focusing more on those other muscles remember I mentioned the shoulder to shoulder look it's not just being thick in the middle but thick shoulder to shoulder if you perform the chest support in a row like I'm doing here two things happen number one you take away",

        "text": "gone on record before saying that the seated row or standing row is one of the best exercises you can do for developing sacredels the other thing here is it makes my back more active from the bottom to the top and what I mean by that is all the muscles posturally have to kick in here to keep you in a proper position to perform the exercise on a CD cable roll we know it's one of those exercises oftentimes gets pretty bastardized until it's not even really recognizable anymore what you're doing if you want to build these muscles up guys remember you want to be able to overload them but you want to be able to overload them meaning the smaller muscles the ones that develop all that Rippling muscle in the back that oftentimes get overlooked and then finally we have some version you knew it had to be in here of a shrug because you're trying to build up those Tom hardy-like traps and stand way up high in the tension well you got two choices here you can do the dead shrug which you may not even know about or the barbell shrug and given the fact that you probably never heard of the Dead shrug before well you know that's going to be the winner I'm going to show you why though this dead shrug is going to give us a few different opportunities here the main difference in performing the exercise with every rep starting off of the floor leading into the shrug versus just going into every shrug from the hanging position is really about involving more of the back like we've been trying to do all along again building those muscles up from the top to the bottom and again the weight used here is not heavy particularly for Jesse and it shouldn't be for you either it's just reinforcing proper lumbar positioning reinforcing isometric contraction of these muscles in the low back and all the way up the spine and again culminating in that upper trap activation at the top of every rep and",
