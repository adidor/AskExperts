        "text": "What s up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com.  So, if your body looks like this right now,   what would it mean to you if you could actually  make it look like this? Or if you're a little   bit older and your body looks like this, how do  you think you would feel if you could look like   this instead? Or maybe even if you look like this  to start, do you think you'd feel better if you   look like this? Well, if you answered yes to any  one of those questions, I ve got good news for you   because I'm going to help you get there today. I'm  going to show you just four steps that are simple,   proven and science based that I promise  you are going to get you to a fit body.   Let's start breaking them down one by one.  So, as you make your way through this video,   you might recognize some of the things  we're talking about here because   you've heard them before. However, I'll ask you  if you've heard it, how come you haven't been   able to act on it? Because while others may have  given you the advice and maybe shown you the door,   they haven't given you the key to unlock the  door. Well, that's not going to give to you,   because we've all heard the advice, for instance,  that you need to be in a hyper caloric state in   order to lose body fat. That is indisputable. And  many studies have proven this time and time again,   however, it's not happening. The reason for it is you're either choosing to be   hypercaloric or you're choosing to be Hypocaloric.    And there's a big difference. You see, guys, being  hyper caloric is a non-negotiable. When body fat   accumulation is your issue, the only way to get  rid of that excess body fat is to take in fewer   calories than you're burning off throughout the  day. However, how big of a jump are you trying   to take? Because those that take too aggressive  of a jump not only find that their diet becomes   unsustainable, but they actually set themselves  up for failure because it's in direct conflict   to one of the other points we're going to  talk about ahead. So, what type of deficit   are we talking about here? Well, you've probably  heard the recommendation of a 500-calorie deficit   from baseline to create a one pound weight loss  over the course of a week. Seven days in a week,   500 calories a day, 3500 total calories  supposedly equal to one pound, although   science will actually disprove that, too. But as  a rough estimate, we can go with that. However,   even at a 200-calorie deficit there, science that  proves that we can do exactly what we want to do,   albeit at a slightly slower pace. If I promise  you, however, that you still be able to look the   way you want to, would you be okay with that? If  so, then let's proceed here to step number two.   You still with me? Good. Because whether you've  read the studies yourself or just trust the   people that have read them for you, the idea  is that you need to take the next step and you   probably know that. But how? How are you going  to become hypocaloric? And this is where people   tend to choose their next diet, Paleo, Keto,  Mediterranean, where instead of focusing on the   name of how you're going to eat, you really should  be focusing on the two main things that matter the   most: your preferences and your behaviors.  And when we talk about preferences, yeah,   it's about the type of foods that you like to eat.  We want to make sure that we're not restricting   too much the type of foods we like to eat or we're  never going to stick with our strategy long term.   But more importantly, what's the behavior that  set you up in the position you are right now?   Because the behavior is the habitual  component, it's the habit you develop.   And breaking a habit is a hell of a lot harder  than making some tweaks to food choices.    For instance, if your behavior is that you eat too  much at every given meal, what are you going to do   about it? Well, here's what the key to that door  comes in, because if you decide that I'm just   going to restrict the amount of food that I eat,  you're likely not going to be able to stick with   this plan for the long term. So, what I would say  instead is let's figure out a way to work within   that behavior. Instead of requiring an overall  behavior change, let's reallocate where we're   going to have our portions be large. I'd rather  see you have an increase in fibrous carbohydrates   knowing that the fiber content is going to  actually fill you faster, but I'm still not   going to deprive you of the larger portions that  you tend to need in order to make you feel full.   But we're going to do it from a less calorically  dense source. So, if we can cut down on some of   those starchy carbohydrates but still allow you  to eat them, because again, preferences matter,",

        "text": "you do light the carbohydrates, we're  just going to eat them in smaller amounts.   This is going to be a diet plan that's set up  for success because it's working both from a   behavioral standpoint and not restricting the  preferences that you have in the first place.    So instead of one and two, we've addressed the  fat portion of the fat to fit transformation.   But now what? Well, now we have to focus on what  we're doing right, the calories out portion where   we exert our efforts, because you've probably been  told that maybe even all exercise is created equal   when it's not making the wrong decision here will  just leave you skinny and I don't think that's   what you're looking for. Because when you looked  at those pictures in the beginning here, what   appealed to you is likely the muscular development  in the after photo. That's what made it stand out.   Going for a jog or a run or jumping on a bike  is an effective way to burn some additional   calories and help you to more effectively and  easily get into that caloric state. But it's   not doing anything to create these after photos  because these after photos rely on building lean   muscle tissue. And the only way you're going to  do that is by incorporating strength training   into your regular exercise regimen. I'm talking  about hitting the weights on a regular basis as   part of your overall exercise programing. Look,  studies will pit head-to-head diet alone versus   diet in conjunction with weight training and every  single time weight training wins out, especially   if it's the muscular physique that you're  looking to build. Don't overlook this subtle   difference here and assume that all exercise is  created equal because as I said, it's not. And   making sure you get this right is imperative  if you want to look like these guys here.    All right, so in step four, well, what training  split are you going to? Because it matters,   or does it? You see, people get confused often  times and confusion leads to no choice at all. I'm   going to do a total bias split because I was told  That's good, or I'm going to do push, pull legs   or I'm going to do the split. But no, people have  said That's bad. So, you know what? I'm going to   do nothing. Well, you need to do something as we  just established. So, what I'm going to tell you   to do is just make sure you're doing this. Here's  the key, progressively overloading, adding more   weight to the bar to allow your strength to build  from work out to work out or phase to phase. Or   increasing metabolic overload and demands on your  body by keeping the rest time shorter and getting   more work accomplished from workout to workout.  Whatever you might do, whatever strategy you pick,   as long as you're striving to push yourself  to a higher level of fitness and strength,   that's going to do the job.  However, if you're a beginner,   you're looking for a great three day a week  total body plan that's been shown to help   build muscle effectively, you can follow the one  that I put together for you for free right here.   It's the perfect beginner workout.
