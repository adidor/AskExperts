        "text": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. The pushup is by far one of the most classic exercises of all time, but it's also the one exercise with probably the most variations of any other exercise. Today I'm going to cover 33 of those from beginner, to intermediate, to advanced with the idea being this: find the version that challenges you. If you're still doing the same, old, classic pushup because that's what you're good at then you're not going to be challenging your body to get any stronger, any better, any different than it is today. Find the version that challenges you and let's get this thing done. So there you have it, guys. 33 pushups. Lots to pick from. No excuses, right? The bottom line is this: the way you do the pushup can challenge you in many, many different ways. You can work on your power. You can work on your strength. You can work on your coordination. You can work on your endurance. There are many, many ways to work a pushup into your routine. It's choosing the right one and knowing how to challenge yourself with it. If you're looking for a program that puts it all together, that challenges you at the right time and makes sure that you're never getting complacent with where you are right now; then head to ATHLEANX.com and get our ATHLEANX training system.
