        "text": "first two even though i love those first two exercises what we're gonna do here is we're gonna be able to hit the brachialis more effectively because of the positioning of the dumbbell during this exercise the pronated grip here during the exercise is going to allow us to take away one of the functions that the biceps provides which is supination of that forearm and by doing so we're still getting the elbow flexion component of any curl and that's going to be driven more effectively especially if done at slower speeds by the brachialis and there's no reason to avoid brachialis development if you want to build your overall upper arm size we know that building up the brachialis will thicken the arms widen them out in the short sleeves and also contribute to the overall mass of the upper arm because it lies underneath the biceps so no reason to cut ourselves at just two guys include this one as well and i promise you you're gonna be happy you did all right so i mentioned that there's other ways that we can curl and there's actually ways we can accentuate the normal curl and that is with this banded dumbbell curl so the dumbbell curl gives us the opportunity to do the more strict standard version of the curl where the overload is really focused on the concentric portion of the lift but the additional band here is going to apply a different strength curve we know that when we do a regular curl the strength curve looks something like this it's a little bit easier in the beginning hardest here in the middle and then a little easier again as we get towards the top when we use a band the curve changes dramatically it starts out pretty easy because there's very little tension on the band and it continues to ramp up as we go all the way up to the top it gets to its most tension because the band is stretched to its greatest length so if",

        "text": "pronation takes care of that second component as well the third thing we can do here is we can actually consciously contract the triceps i've shared this tip before when we do that we're going to get a reflexive relaxation of the biceps that's going to enhance that stretch even further you perform your curls out of here with the main focus being i want to provide this tension to the bicep in this elongated position and it provides yet another unique benefit that the other exercises simply don't and last but not least guys again it's worth the wait cutting yourself off at a couple of other big exercises while i love them again it would not have given you the benefit of this exercise and this is a keeper i talk about how you want to make sure that you take that bicep and apply tension in that stretch position but you also have to apply it in the contracted position and the best way to do that is with one of these exercises i actually showed you the spider curl in the past and how getting our arms out in front of our body actually allows for that shoulder flexion for that supination for that elbow flexion then i showed you this exercise and actually jesse fell in love with this exercise so much that he did just this exercise for 30 days and actually saw benefits from it and this was the dumbbell waiter curl and keeping your dumbbell in this position here with the dumbbell facing flat up towards the ceiling actually allowed us to get that peak contraction on the biceps and if you have tried it you've already probably seen that for yourself but guess what again always worth the wait here you can combine the position of the spider curl with the execution of the weight or curl and get an insane bicep exercise which is what i'm doing here it actually frees the dumbbell up to travel more freely to the top without the legs",
