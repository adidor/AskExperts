        "text": "If you've got a throbbing pain that  you can literally put your finger on   right there, that feels like someone's stabbing  you right in the elbow. Guess what? You're on the   right video and the right place because we're  going to get rid of that once and for all.    What s up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com.  So, if you ve got that pain right there,   Tennis Elbow. I don't care if you don't play  tennis because most people that have this actually   don't. What can you do about it? Well, I made  a video a while back where I discussed what the   actual cause of tennis elbow was, and it wasn't  actually your elbow just getting blamed for it.   It's coming from either mechanics of the shoulder  and the shoulder blade that aren't in place,   or maybe even down below that at the hip or  even somewhere distal here in the wrist that's   not functioning the way it should that causes  this elbow to bear the brunt of the issue.    Well, as I mentioned before, most  people get this not from tennis,   although it came from the fact that when people  did the backhand, they would experience that pain.   But we're talking about what's  happening right here in the gym   because our problem is oftentimes caused right  here in the gym, and I can almost point my finger   at one particular exercise that does this.  It s the side lateral raise. I love the side   lateral raise. I program the side of lateral  raise in almost every single program I do.   However, there are some key points that you  want to make sure that you're focusing on   to do it right, so let me show you what we're  talking about. When we do that side lateral raise   one of the things, I preach so many times is  that this zone right about here for most people,   it's sort of the dead minute zone, right? Because  what happens in this range is we try to take a   weight that's basically appropriate for what  we're trying to accomplish, which is a raise   on the dumbbell out to the side. But it exceeds  the ability of these extensor tendons to manage   that way, especially as the arm gets longer and  longer and held out further from our body.    Whereas down here, it's really where we  want to focus your efforts, the light side   of the rack. But when you do that, as I pointed  out, you use these intensity techniques that   take the light weight or the weight that feels  maybe a little too light to you right now, and   it ups the overall intensity of the effort you're  doing so you still get the gains you're seeking.   Things like one and a half reps, right? Slow  motion reps, that's where you want to live. I   will also show that when you go down this end of  the rack, you actually can handle that as well.   But there's ways that we do that with a cheat  lateral that actually is almost pointing towards   that ultimate solution for tennis elbow because  we're getting some other things contributing.   You can see that right here. Hips, lower body,  other things contributing. So, if I were to take   a weight that was too heavy for me to handle as  I go out here, I'm basically asking for isometric   contraction here of the wrist to hold that weight  from falling down, right? We could see it could go   into a really light weight so I could demonstrate  even better. Right here, I'm preventing this from   falling so that isometric contraction is wholly  responsible from the extensive here, the risk that   all bundle up and attach that that one point that  ends up hurting you. And it doesn't have to happen   over the course of many, many, many, many  workouts. You can exceed the capacity of these   extenders, a one single rep which can cause this  problem. So, it's not necessarily an overuse more   of an over taxation of these muscles that can't  handle that. So, what I've told you before to do   is turn the arm up a bit, right? No longer poor in  the pitchers but turn the arm up a little bit. And   we talked about the benefits of what that does  for the shoulder by creating more room and less   impingement. But what it also does is it takes the  extensors from being what are primarily preventing   that dumbbell from falling down and it now turns  it a little bit like this, which allows more of   the radial deviations of the wrist this way to  take off some of that load. That change alone   will help most people who are doing the exercise  who feel like it's causing pain in their elbow.   But again, let's say you already got the problem.  You've already got the pain. How do we solve that?   That's where we interestingly go back when we  look at something like the cheat lateral for   the true solution. So here it is. Instead, we want  to grab this. You can use a dumbbell if you want,   but a kettlebell works perfectly here. And the  exercise that you want to start incorporating",

        "text": "three times a week. If you already have a  raging case of Tennis Elbow, believe it or not,   is a kettlebell swing. And why this works is  because we need to start training the body to   work as the kinetic chain that's intended to be.  Meaning that this spot here that was overloaded,   that was thrown the responsibility of maintaining  a weight that it couldn't handle because the   rest of the body wasn't participating.  We need to start to reintroduce the rest of the   body to that move. And the best way to do it is to  take it from the side and bring it to the front,   which still causes the same stress here at that  point of the elbow and give it the support that   it needs with the other muscles. So, what the  kettlebell swing does is it loads us into hip   flexion, right? We're getting into this hip  flexion position and then allowing the extension   of the hips to assist the weight as it comes up,  keeping the isometric control here, but again,   offloading this and giving it some additional  support. So if we can continue to do something   to work on getting over the injury  rather than putting everything away,   packing up your gym bag, going home and  staying home and hoping it gets better.   Or worse, rubbing on it, icing, ultrasounding  it, throwing a brace on it. Everything   I said not to do in that last video.  That's not going to be a long-term solution.   That's why you keep going back and getting this  problem over and over and over again because   you're never working on actually strengthening the  muscles that need strengthening and incorporating   the entire kinetic chain. So, what we do is  we start with two hands on the kettlebell,   right? In this position here. You can see that  we have to have this neutral wrist position,   which requires activation of the extension of the  forearm. So, if I'm in here and I perform a swing   where I load up and here load up posteriorly,  you can see at the top, it's driven by the hips.   But the arm is staying in this extended position  and the wrist is staying in this extended   position, which is creating that stress. But  the good form of stress to that extensor tendon   wad up here and the elbow and maintaining the  mechanics in the support from below. So I do   swings, I do them three times a week for, let's  say, 50 swings at a time, increasing it to 75,   100 swings, gradually increasing the  load that you use each time you do it,   or at least the volume of the swings that you  do and then gradually increasing the load.   But one thing you can do without  having to actually increase the   load of the kettlebell you're using is then  switch to a single arm version of it. So,   the same thing here load through the hips and  pop up. Again, even if you have a raging case   right now of a lateral epicondylitis or Tennis  Elbow, you'll find that that doesn't really   stress that. It gets blood to the area, it's doing  much more for you in terms of a long-term solution   than doing any of that rubbing or throwing  a brace on it a short term Band-Aid.   The next thing you could do comes from looking  towards that cheat lateral again. Why are people   able to handle loads, even if again, you  have a raging case of Tennis Elbow right now,   you could likely do a cheat lateral with heavier  weight far more than you could do strict lateral   with that middle of the road weight, like I  talked about here. That's because you're getting   the assistance of the lower body in terms of  loading and assisting that weight on the way up,   supporting those extenders, not leaving them  out on an island. So, if we know that we can   get help by rotating and loading into a  hip, you could also do an offset version   of a kettlebell swing. So, I drop it down  to the side and I come up like that.   So now I'm loading these hips to be able to  drive up through internal rotation and then   forcibly into external rotation here at the  top. The fact is, how you perform your swing   is going to be up to you. Again, to handed  to start single arm down the middle,   single arm off to the side. But the more you  start to incorporate kettlebell swings into your   overall routine, the faster you're going to get  to not only a permanent solution to this problem,   but actually some immediate relief. Because these  muscles need to still be worked, they just have   to be worth the right way, and they need to get  the support that they're looking for in need in   order to function the right way without pain.  If you guys are looking for programs where we put   the science back in the strength, we put the  thought into how we program the things we do.",
