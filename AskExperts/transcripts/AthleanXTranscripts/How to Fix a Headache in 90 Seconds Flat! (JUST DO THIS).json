        "text": "What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com.  So if you've got a headache, then you've come   to the right video because I'm going to show you  something you can do right here in 90 seconds   that will get rid of the majority of headaches,  especially if they are tension based headaches   caused by muscle tightness, we can release  those. Now, this is a workout channel,   so I know that we oftentimes can have tension  headaches because we overdevelop muscles that   can lead to that and we don't want to miss  workouts because our head hurts. That being said,   people that work at a desk all day oftentimes also  get tension headaches and I want to help everybody   with this. So, what we do is we break out one of  these, this is a lacrosse ball. Now, I've talked   about in past videos, I don't go around telling  you to stick lacrosse balls all over your body   because oftentimes it just makes it a bad  situation even worse, especially sciatica. But for   this application in a trigger point in the upper  trap, this is a godsend, and this is all you need.   So, I'm going to take Jesse here, he's going to  be my dummy for this. What a perfect job for you,   Jesse. I've been waiting all along to find the  right job, a dummy. So, we're going to take   this ball and utilize Jesse to show you exactly  what you have to do. It's a very easy step by step   process. So, the muscle that we're going to try to  target here is this. This is the upper trapezius,   and this is where we oftentimes harbor the trigger  point that leads to radiating pain up the back of   the neck into your head that causes the headaches.  So, if we can put ourselves into a position of   relaxation on that muscle is utilizes something  called the Jones Strain Counter Strain Technique.   And with this ball, what your first goal is, is to  take it and put it right in the area of the trap   that is most sore when you touch it. All right. Now, what do you do with your   legs? Because it actually matters. The leg on the  same side as the trap that you're treating just   gets to kind of lay on its side off does nothing.  The leg on the opposite side is actually going to   post up with your foot flat on the floor because  you're going to need to do something with that   in a second. What happens up here at the head now  is when you have that ball on the spot is number   one, you side bend your head, you bring the ear  on the same side as the trap that you're treating   down towards your shoulders. So, you side bend  your head down towards that same side shoulder   as Jesse did right there. Then we're going to get  a little bit of rotation to the opposite side. So,   all I do is I say just turn your head a little bit  so you can look straight up at the ceiling. Okay,   so side bent, but then turn your head so  you can look straight at the ceiling.    Now, you want to get this arm up because you get  that trap into relaxation. So the arm goes up   over your head as far as it can, and then this arm  comes behind on the back of the elbow to basically   hold it there, because all of this has to happen  passively. You're not actively holding yourself   in any position. Now, the last thing he does to  really drive this home is he uses this posted up   leg here. He presses down through the foot to  bridge up, which basically angles his body now   down into that ball a little bit harder, driving  that ball right into that really uncomfortable   spot. You feel it? Absolutely. Oh, man. And  then all you're going to do is hang out for   ninety seconds and that's it. And what will happen  is that trigger point that's being caused by who   knows, a lot of people have a lot of different  theories as to what's causing the trigger point.   Whether it's at the facial level, whether it's  at the level of the muscle fibers and a cluster   of muscle fibers that are tensed up and won't  release, you have to reset the mechanisms of the   stress reflex, whatever it is that's actually  causing it, I don't know if you really care as   much as you really want to get rid of it. Within  90 seconds of this guy's, what will happen is you   come out of that position slowly and then you  come out and you move your head around just a   little bit to reprogram it, give it a minute or  two. If you still have symptoms, that you would do   it to the other side. If it is possible, you could  have trigger points in both traps, oftentimes it's   common. So maybe the 90 second technique takes  three minutes instead of 90 seconds. The fact is   it's not going to take long for you to obtain the  relief. And I've done this before, guys, with back   pain videos, I'm going to link that one for you  at the end of this video if you haven't seen it.   If you do the right things, you can actually  make an impact very quickly. This is one of   those things that leads to a quick impact.  If you found the video helpful, makes you first",

        "text": "of all, you tell me that it worked for you down  below and also be on the lookout, because I'm   going to do another one on how to fix a stiff neck  using another location here in the same technique.   If you're looking for step by step programs, guys,  where we don't overlook any of the little things,   because, as you know, a workout with a headache  is not as good a workout as one without one.   I want to make sure you get the most out of  everything you do. All of our plans are based   around that same putting the science back in  strength concept, they're over at athleanx.com.   If you have already done so, guys, make sure  you click subscribe, turn on your notifications,   so you never miss a new video when we put one out.  All right, guys see you soon.
