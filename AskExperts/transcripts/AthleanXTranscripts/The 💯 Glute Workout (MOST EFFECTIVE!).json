        "text": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.comÂ  What you're about to watch is going to be theÂ Â  most effective glute workout you've ever done.Â  How do I know? Because this workout is anotherÂ Â  one in our 100 Series where I'm getting youÂ  to trade in ineffective volume and essentiallyÂ Â  wasted time in the gym for more productiveÂ  workouts through the use of effective reps.Â Â  And the effective reps are the ones thatÂ  we commonly associate with the end of anyÂ Â  given set. So, if you performed a set ofÂ  12 to failure, it'd be the ninth, 10th,Â Â  11th and 12th, you know, the ones that you hadÂ  to actually fight for and grind to produce theÂ Â  challenge that's necessary to change you.  And that scenario, the first through eighthÂ Â  rep were actually there just to sort of getÂ  you to the point where those effective repsÂ Â  can actually begin. But what if there was a wayÂ  we could actually get into those more effectiveÂ Â  reps more consistently and skip the line on theÂ  lower productive side of the set? In other words,Â Â  get rid of that volume that's notÂ  really serving a purpose for us,Â Â  only getting us to the point where we can actuallyÂ  create a difference. Well, we could do that.  Â  And we start with our first exercise, it'sÂ  the Barbell Hip Thrust. And what I want youÂ Â  to do is choose a weight that will cause you toÂ  fail in the 12-rep range on the exercise.  Â  [Music] Now, this firstÂ Â  set is something that we call theÂ  Ignition Set, it's just priming youÂ Â  for the effective rep total that we're goingÂ  to accrue and the sets that follow it. Now,Â Â  don't go too far away because you're goingÂ  to limit your rest here to just 15 seconds.Â Â  This is the short rest-pause interval that'sÂ  responsible for getting you right back intoÂ Â  those more intense repetitions more quickly.Â  And when we reach the end of this period,Â Â  we get right back into it again and we startÂ  to crank out our reps. Now, here is where theÂ Â  effective reps begin, and I want you to do isÂ  just chip away as many that you can per setÂ Â  following each rest pause that will count towardsÂ  a total of 20 effective reps on this exercise.  Â  Maybe get four or five the first time, threeÂ  or four the next time, however many you get,Â Â  all I want you to do is make sure you accumulateÂ  20 before you move on to the next exercise.Â Â  And for that, we're talking about a Barbell,Â  RDL. So, we're still going to work on the glutesÂ Â  in their hip extension function, but this timeÂ  through a Hip Hinge. We want to take that firstÂ Â  set to failure using a weight that causesÂ  failure at that 12-rep range. Now, again,Â Â  once we've gotten to that point, we don'tÂ  walk away. We don't go too far because,Â Â  again, we have to keep this rest time shortÂ  in order to keep that tension high.  Â  In other words, to keep the recovery shortÂ  so that the repetitions that we've performedÂ Â  thereafter are more challenging,Â  it's about the effect of reps. So,Â Â  I grab the weight and I start right back up again.Â  And here again I will feel that challenge muchÂ Â  more quickly. That first and second and thirdÂ  and fourth and fifth repetition here are tough,Â Â  but that's what we want because we're going toÂ  trade in again that workout length for intensity,Â Â  but in doing so, better results. Remember,Â  guys, you're doing these until you've reachedÂ Â  a total of 20 effective reps once againÂ  and we move on to the next exercise.  Â  Now, remember, if you're liking 100 workouts,Â  subscribe and check the two videos I'm goingÂ Â  to link for you at the end of this workout. I'mÂ  going to have the chest and back for you to tryÂ Â  too. But not quite yet, because they're stillÂ  working on that backside of yours first. And theÂ Â  next way we're going to do it is with a pair ofÂ  dumbbells and one of my favorite exercises calledÂ Â  the Dumbbell Sprinter Lunge. And if you do thisÂ  with proper form, you should look like you're inÂ Â  the starting blocks of 100-meter sprint. The key is to drive your body backing up toÂ Â  the top and quickly get the other leg in placeÂ  so you can perform this in alternating fashion.Â Â  As always, once I reach my failure thisÂ  time between the eight and 10 rep range,Â Â  keep that interval short. Again, 15 seconds hereÂ  is all I need, but when I get back into it again,Â Â  oh man, I can feel these repetitions right offÂ  the bat. And again, we chip away as many as weÂ Â  can per set between each rest-pause interval.Â  Maybe it's only four or five on each leg,Â Â  we take our next rest-pause, and we get right backÂ  into it again until we reach that cumulative total",

        "text": "of 20 effective reps on the exercise before weÂ  move on. This time to exercise number four. Â  And that's where we get to do oneÂ  of my favorite [chirping sound]Â Â  That is where we get to actually use one of myÂ  favorite exercises, and it's another posteriorÂ Â  chain killer. And it's the Pullthrough. AndÂ  with the Pullthrough allows us to once againÂ Â  work on that all important hip hinge and inÂ  doing so, light up that posterior chain andÂ Â  glutes. And I want you to imagine yourÂ  hands dropping back behind you as far asÂ Â  possible. And all you're going to do isÂ  just simply drive your hips back in theÂ Â  opposite direction to pull the rope up. Don't pull with your arms. let the glutesÂ Â  drive the forward momentum of the rope. And ifÂ  you do this properly, you should feel a good,Â Â  strong contraction at the top of every repetition.Â  Once again, choosing a weight that will cause youÂ Â  to fail after 12 of those. Try to knock outÂ  as many repetitions as you can after eachÂ Â  subsequent rest-pause period on your way toÂ  a total once again of 20 effective reps.  Â  And so, if you've been counting all along,Â  you probably figured out now that you're atÂ Â  80 effective reps, 20 shy of the 100 effective repÂ  total. But we're not done yet, we've got 20 more.Â Â  But not just 20 of anything, 20 of a particularÂ  exercise that's going to stress the glutes inÂ Â  a way you haven't done yet and actually in a wayÂ  that most people forget to do entirely. And thatÂ Â  is we can't always train the sagittal plane,Â  we have to introduce other planes of motion,Â Â  importantly the frontal plane, becauseÂ  that is where we hit the glute medius.  Â  And one of the best ways to train the gluteÂ  medius is with a band and an exercise calledÂ Â  the Hip Drop. And all I want you to do isÂ  simply anchor the band around your hips,Â Â  hold on to something for support and allowÂ  your hips to drop in the direction that theÂ Â  band is anchored. But that just sets you up toÂ  perform this, right. Because what I want youÂ Â  to do is now drive your hips back in the oppositeÂ  direction against the resistance of the band.  Â  We're getting abduction of the hip on that downÂ  leg, and we're actually really targeting heavilyÂ Â  that glute medius and oftentimes very, very weakÂ  muscle. To perform this particular exercise rightÂ Â  at this point in the workout, you're going toÂ  focus on one hip at a time. Take this to 12Â Â  rep failure, rest your 15 seconds and get rightÂ  back in it again and start chipping away at yourÂ Â  20 effective reps on that hip. The adjustment ofÂ  the resistance to match your strength level onlyÂ Â  requires you to either step further away or closerÂ  to the anchor point to make it work for you.  Â  But we're not done quite yet because as I'veÂ  done in all the 100 workouts, I kind of endÂ Â  it with an option. In other words, I give you aÂ  chance to do just a little bit more. EspeciallyÂ Â  for those who are a little bit on the psychoticÂ  side of things. Because the last burnout hereÂ Â  I'm going to give you as an opportunity to workÂ  your way up a static ladder. If you're familiarÂ Â  with the rest of the workouts in this series,Â  you probably know what I'm talking about. Â  This one is going to be the Glute Bridge CurlÂ  Ladder, and we're going to use a physio ball toÂ Â  do the exercise. And what I want you to do is layÂ  on your back and put your legs straight out on topÂ Â  of the ball and engage the glutes completely byÂ  fully extending through the hips. In other words,Â Â  have those legs and torso be in a completelyÂ  straight line. Now perform one Hamstring Curl.Â Â  You have to be able to keep your hips up whileÂ  you curl the ball back and extend it back out.Â Â  And then hold for 5 seconds and then curl backÂ  and extend it back out and hold for 5 seconds.  Â  And your job is to try to get to aÂ  cumulative total of 20 repetitions,Â Â  which if you add in the whole time, is 100Â  seconds of hold. Now, I'm not expecting you toÂ Â  be able to get there all in one shot. That'sÂ  where the rest-pause comes in. If you have to,Â Â  you rest for 15 seconds, you get back into itÂ  until all 100 seconds of hold are achieved. Again,Â Â  the option is yours and it's not for everybody,Â  just for those that have balls or a ball.  Â  And so if you look at the workout, you can performÂ  it in a way that might be more traditional asÂ Â  straight sets, you'll see something reallyÂ  interesting. In each one of those sets,Â Â  remember, the last three or four repetitionsÂ  were the only ones that were productive. SoÂ Â  that the end of it all, when you totalÂ  up all the number of effective reps,Â Â  you would get in a straight set performance ofÂ  this, you're looking at just a little bit over",

        "text": "50. But we perform it in effective rep styleÂ  where essentially every single repetitionÂ Â  becomes effective, we realize we've actuallyÂ  just double the number of effective reps andÂ Â  we've actually done it in a lot less time.  And because I want to make sure I put my moneyÂ Â  where my mouth is, I'm going to give you aÂ  chance to try the workout. And as always,Â Â  I'm going to give you the workout right here. IÂ  m going to give you the opportunity to screenshotÂ Â  step-by-step, rep-by-rep, so you can take this toÂ  the gym and try it for yourself. And when you'reÂ Â  ready to try the others in the series guys, IÂ  mentioned the back workout and the 100-chestÂ Â  workout. You're going to want to try both ofÂ  those as well as the others in this series. Â  In order to get everyone that we put out inÂ  the series guys, you ve got to make sure yourÂ Â  subscribed and turn on your Notifications.Â  If you're looking for a full workout,Â Â  we have them all over at Athleanx.com. AllÂ  right, guys, good luck. I'll see you soon.",
