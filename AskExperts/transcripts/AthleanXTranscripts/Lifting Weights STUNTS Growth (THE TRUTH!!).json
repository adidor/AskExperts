        "text": "themselves here in the transverse processes of the lumbar spine when a gymnast does a lot of repetitive excessive extension through their low back you can actually get fractures here but again that's not something that's related to the growth plate so it's not really concerned now where is some of this advice though that comes to you that says well you shouldn't train then until you've reached puberty you know where that really comes from guys it comes from the fact that hormonally you're not going to benefit that much from your training if you don't have the hormones to support the efforts you're trying to create if you're trying to create more muscle and you're an eight-year-old or a nine-year-old good luck it ain't really gonna happen it's sort of wasted effort so those recommendations aren't based off of growth plate fears although some pediatricians still think that because again they're stuck in the in the ways of their older older thinking and sort of believing in this myth it's not about the growth place it has nothing to do with that it's just supporting your efforts with a better hormonal environment to actually allow you to take advantage of your efforts so what my recommendation is is when you're growing up as you're approaching your teens as you're reaching puberty there is no problem with learning the right way to train and one of the best things you can do is actually implement a technique bar if that's what you're going to do and if you're going to eventually wind up training with real weights learning how to manipulate a barbell at an early age is going to be very beneficial to you a technique bar is going to be a very light load something that that any young adolescent let's say 10 11 12 can actually use very safely the most important thing that you should be learning to do at that point is to develop your technique to develop",
