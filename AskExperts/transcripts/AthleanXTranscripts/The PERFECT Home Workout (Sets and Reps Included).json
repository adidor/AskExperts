        "text": "from the exercises before that that is one of the best ways that you can train body weight when you realize that because of the way you can mechanically set up your exercises you can continue to perform it gives you the chance to actually train to a point of progressive overload where others would stop at a single point on a single exercise this is where i think the power of this workout comes in so that being said guys there's a lot to cover here i want to make sure i go over every single one of these workouts for you in every exercise so let's kick it off here workout a all right so workout a here is comprised of those six major groupings like i mentioned and don't worry about having to memorize them or the individual exercises i'm going to do as i always do for you i'm going to put them all together and lay them out in a workout format for you at the end of this video but let's take a look right here at the first combination it was that anterior chain squat focused lower body circuit starting off with this exercise it's the alternating single leg box squat now look if you're at a more advanced level you're gonna perform this from a lower box if you have to do this at a more intermediate or beginner level you can simply raise the box now again this box can be anything it could be a bed it could be a couch any surface that you can get yourself down to we move on here to something called the one and a half bottomed out squats and we talked about in other videos the benefit of working in that bottom range of the squat in that parallel to below parallel range to strengthen that portion which is oftentimes the weakest area of the squat we can do that here again regardless of what level we're at we take this for the entire minute again if you have to rest pause you can do that from here we then go in and we finish out this circuit which your legs will probably be pretty fried at this point with a simple jump",
