        "text": "And so, if you find yourself skinny fat, the  good news is it's not only a fixable solution,   but it's one you can fix fast, just like Jesse. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa who you calling   skinny fat? I mean, do you have a short memory?   No, but I have a bad memory. Too much head trauma.    What s up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com.  Jesse Laico, Athleanx.com.    By the way, skinny fat. Here you  are. This is a picture because   pictures tend to help people with bad memories. Well, I thought we deleted those a long time.   No, we keep them around for just these  purposes like this. Guys, if you're looking for   a solution to your skinny fat problem, the  good news is, as I mentioned in the open,   it is fixable and it's fixable quite fast if  you do the right things. All right. So, when   we're talking about skinny fat we're looking at  a situation where you sort of look like this.    You're skinny and you're fat.  I mean, let's look at a little bit differently.   You lack muscle and you still maintain some  fat around your waistline, especially for men,   particularly around their waistline.  You've got skinny arms, maybe skinny legs,   you got no chest, maybe not even any  abs, but you got some midsection fat.   Well, that looks a lot like  me in those pictures.    There you go. So now how do we fix that? We've got  two choices, right? You can either opt to attack   your fat problem and try to get skinnier. However,  I wouldn't advise that because when you do,   you end up looking like this. That doesn't look so good.   No. What this is, is this is just a very  skinny person. See, the base of what's   happening in a skinny fat person is a lack of  muscularity. They have no muscular development.   So, what you're going to want to do is make  sure that you build muscle to start fixing   this problem. However, we do have to consider  nutrition, too. And there's actually two things   that I know about every skinny fat person  watching this video right now, two facts.    What's that?  The first thing is they're not   following a training plan.  Okay.   Sort of like you work following  a training plan, Jesse.   All right. Why do you have to call me out? Which is why you were skinny fat.   We'll get into that in a second. The other thing  that I know is that you are not hypocaloric.   You know what that means? That means less calories   than your maintenance level. Maintenance level. That's right. You are   not there because if you were, you lose the body  fat that still remains around your midsection.    Yeah. In the case of Jesse, his hypercaloric   state wasn't there because he was eating too  many gummy bears and some other things. Right?   Still calling me out.  But you're still accumulating too many calories   from all those sugary foods. So, let's start  there. What is the game plan for you and what   you're going to have to do to fix this problem  once and for all? From a nutrition standpoint,   the fact that I know you're not hypercaloric  means at least you're at maintenance.    Yeah. If not, you're in some sort of calorie surplus.   Well, guess what? You're in a good enough state  to build muscle. Because we actually know that   you can build muscle at the same time that you're  losing fat in a caloric deficit as long as your   protein content is high enough. Right.   The recommendation there is about .8 grams  per pound of body weight. If you're in that   range and you're slightly hypercaloric,  not very hypercaloric, but let's say 200,   300 calories below your maintenance levels,  you're still going to be able to add muscle mass,   albeit at a much slower rate. But you can still do  it if your protein levels are up. But we know that   you're at least at maintenance, if not above.  Yeah.    My recommendation from a nutrition standpoint,  just to ensure that you've got the building blocks   to build muscle, it's just to take out some of  your carbohydrates and swap in some protein. So   do me a favor, just count your protein content  and grams for one or two days. We generally like",

        "text": "to eat around the same things almost every single  day, so just do it for two days. Though I don't   ever really advise becoming a mathematician  when it comes to counting your calories and   measuring out things every single day. Just for  your own awareness it might help you to see how   much you're taking in. Yeah.   Because if you're not at that .8 grams per pound  of body weight right now, you might be surprised   at how below that level you are. Simply taking  out some carbohydrates on a gram per gram basis,   they have the same amount of calories, that's four  you can make that easy swap. We don't have to play   around with increasing or decreasing calories. Right.   Now, nutritionally that's good enough. But we have  to focus on that other thing. I remember I said   you're not training. No, you're exercising.   You're exercising. Look, if you're not on some  sort of a committed plan, you're not going to   build muscle. If you exercise and think that  that's a committed plan, it's not. And it's   the reason why you haven't built any muscle. You  can't look like this and be a skinny fat person   and have any real training history under your  belt. And what I mean by training is having a   progressive plan that is followed consistently.  Because I'm sorry, even a bad plan--   Not dangerous plan. Not a dangerous plan, but a bad plan,   and a lot of them out there by the way. But a bad  plan follow consistently is still going to help   you to build muscle.  Yeah.    So, you need to get on a training plan  and these are the things that have to be   part of that plan. Number one, you have to  have a focus, as we always talk about here,   on building your base strength around a strong  foundation in the bigger compound lifts.    Right.  Just like Jesse has.    Yup in the squat, bench and deadlift. I've been  progressing the weight that I've been using over   a long period of time, but short increments  of that amount of weight and the weight has   gone up actually pretty significantly. So then in two-or three-time body weight.   Three times, yeah. So, then your squat is going up as well.    Yeah. So, building around this foundation.   But let's talk about reality here. Reality is  you might have something called extra phobia.   Which I definitely had. And you're not alone. A lot of people,   when they first start out of the plan, again,  no muscle on your body, which means you've   probably never even hit the gym. Because we  know even as a newbie, you're going to gain   muscle sometimes just by looking at the weights,  but you have to look at the weights consistently   in order for that to happen. You need to  understand that some of those exercises are   going to feel a little daunting to you and you  may avoid them altogether. And that's a mistake,   right? I talked about and in many videos before,  you need to start somewhere on them, realize   that just because these are basic exercises,  don't assume that they're so simple to do.    Right.  The more compound the exercise is, the   more complex it actually is to perform it. You've  got a lot of different muscles working together   in sync. You've got to move an uncoordinated body,  oftentimes through space, through these multiple   joints, which can become challenging. And you have  many different areas up and down the kinetic chain   for these weaknesses to actually rather ugly head  and cause that lift to go the wrong direction.    Yeah. Right? You could have tight ankles,   you could have a lack of mobility in your hips,  you could have a lack of thoracic extension. All   these things would inhibit your ability to perform  the squat, let's say, safely and also maximally by   adding as much weight as possible because you're  not moving through space in the most efficient   way. So, you would actually just look up some  of the Athlean-X videos when you identify what   some of your postural and biomechanical  flaws are and work on fixing those.   Yeah. As you continue to attack those weights and as   you continue to build upon that solid foundation.  But in no instance are you supposed to avoid the   exercises altogether. We need to focus on those.  Yeah.",

        "text": "The next thing you have to do, and this  might come as a shock to some of those   on the skinny fat spectrum here, and that  is, should they be following any of the   other exercises? Is the minimalist approach  enough or should you be doing more?    You should definitely be doing more  because the isolation exercises or   the smaller exercise will not only help to  build hypertrophy and build larger muscles   and improve your physique, but it will also carry  over into your bigger lifts and compound lifts.   You're learning something here  Jesse, after all these years.    Hey, I ve been listening to you a lot.  The head trauma hasn t completely shot your   brain there. But the fact is, yes, when you  follow these other exercises and supplement   them into your routine, there's three things  that actually happen. Number one, you might   actually have some fun, right? Because though  the compound is maybe a little bit scary to you   at the beginning of your journey, these are the  exercises that you tend to look forward to.    Yeah. Right? Because you   just get to feel a little bit better and perform  them where you like the pump that you get from   doing that. So, guess what? I do them because  it'll increase your attraction to the gym and   keep you on that consistent training plan. At speaking of the pump, just like Arnold talked   about how great the pump is-- Oh Jesus, here we go.   You know, I get the feeling of coming.  Coming all the time with this pump.   You know, I feel like I'm coming in the gym. I'm  coming at home. I'm coming, you know, backstage   before a show. I'm coming all the time. And we know we heard about pump story with Arnold.   Secondly, as you learn that not only do you have  fun doing these, but you get a better my muscle   connection from doing these smaller exercises.  Guess what that does? That actually helps you   to create a larger sum of the parts so that when  you go back to the compound lift, the output is   overall better.  Yeah.    So, it helps you to actually increase your overall  output. The third thing that doing these lifts   actually does is it increases some of the overall  training volume to assist in the hypertrophied   that you're talking about. So, you want to make  sure that you add those to your training routine.   If you were doing these things, guys, the only  other thing that you can sort of screw up here   is the consistency with what you're  doing and the training frequency. So,   what I would say is even again, a plan  that got you in the gym three times a week.   Like our perfect total body workout, that  will be enough if done in a progressive manner   to start to help you to build the muscle that we  were talking about in the beginning. Remember,   the muscle growth is going to be the solution  to your skinny fat problems. Now, if you want   to go back at the end and start looking  at how you're going to address the overall   excess fat that you have, well, then you  can start fine tuning it from there.    Yeah.  And again, that's   where I oftentimes say continue to try to pursue  both, albeit at a little bit of a slower pace,   by allowing yourself to manipulate your protein  content, getting a slightly hypercaloric state to   get rid of the fat and keep the muscle going. That  is an option. You still have the option to do the   alternative and go in a slightly hypercaloric  state to try to make that happen a little bit   faster. The point is, starting with the muscle  growth, is how you're going to solve your skinny   fat problems. And making the few but important  changes to nutrition is going to have all the   difference in helping you to get to your goal.  Now, I talked about it being fast. Here's the   reason why. If you have no appreciable muscle  mass in your body right now, because you're   never have followed a training plan, guess what?  Those new gains come in handy here. They allow   you to start adding weight and muscle weight at a  much faster rate than any other time in your life.   If you do this right, guys, I promise you, you're  going to start to like what you see at a much   faster pace than you may have even expected.
