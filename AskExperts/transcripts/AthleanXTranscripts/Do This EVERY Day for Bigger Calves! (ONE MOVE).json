        "text": "What s up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, athleanx.com.  So if you're looking to get bigger calves,   I'm going to show you what you can do here today.  Now, I've shown you something in the past as a   good calf exercise to do. However, some either  don't have the set up to be able to do it or   they feel a little bit too much in the hamstring.  Well, that is one of those exercises that delivers   its gains through the overload and tension that  you get from it. But if you're going to go on   the easier end here, you're going to have to  increase the volume. And one of the best ways   to increase the volume is to do a simple standing  calf raise, but do it every single day. And it's   not going to take you a long period of time  here, but you do have to make a couple of very   important changes to how you do these if  you want to do it right. So, Jesse here--   Hey guys. --our local calf not. I talk about you re either   a calf or a calf not. I happen to be somewhat of  a calf not, Jesse is definitely a calf not. Which,   by the way, isn t necessarily his fault or  your fault if you re in the same situation,   since we know calf size is largely determined by  genetics. But nonetheless, improvable with smart,   consistent training, like I'm going to show you  here. What you want to do is evaluate how you do   your calf raises. Because doing the standard high  rep, low weight, bounce your way through your sets   approach is really doing nothing more than feeding  into the ballistic way that your Achilles tendon   prefers to function to the detriment of your calf  development, as you can see here in a second.   So, first thing, you want to go one leg at a  time, right? You're going to be able to deliver   more tension into that calf and more focused  tension than doing a simple barbell calf raise   with both legs at a time or dumbbell calf raise,  both legs at a time where you can sort of hide   your imbalances in strength. The second thing you  want to do is change the tempo that we do this.   Why? The Achilles tendon is one of the strongest  tendons in your entire body. This is a ballistic   tendon. It transfers quickly between plantar  flection and dorsiflexion on every step we take   because it has a high capacity for force.  But what happens is it also robs the calf muscle   itself of a lot of the tension that it can help  out and deliver as well. Why? Because it's the   first line of defense. It's the most proximal  to the ground, and it takes those forces, and it   prevents them from being transmitted up the chain  into this calf muscle. So, this is one of those   instances where the Achilles is actually being  functionally efficient and making, let's say,   running easier, but preventing the muscular  inefficiency that I talk about all the time   that we need to seek when we're trying  to force a stubborn muscle to grow.   So how can we change that? Slow down the cadence.  Jesse pick up your dumbbell for a second. So,   what you re going to do is you're going to get  into this position, and we want to try to remove   the ballistic capacity of the Achilles tendon.  Right? So, we get down into the stretch position   and I'm saying all the way down to where you  feel a real stretch on the bottom of this rep.   And then from there, we come up after  four seconds and we get to the top here.   And now you don't just stay there,  once you there, you go up even higher   all the way to the peak there for four  seconds. And we slowly come back down again,   and we get all the way to the bottom four  seconds. There is no bouncing back and forth.   This is truly from dorsiflexion here, slowly back  up to the top into planar reflection. And again,   by removing that, the calf itself has to do  way more of the work. How are you feeling?    Oh, it sucks.  So two reps in and he's already starting   to feel it. I don't care how many reps you get. I  talk about in the past, you either make the reps   count or you count the reps. This is where you re  going to want to make the reps count. You cannot   care about counting here. You just have to make  them count by going all the way to the bottom   and removing this distribution of force that gets  usually robbed by the Achilles tendon. And that's   it, guys. Basically, if you take this exercise  and you do it each side, three sets, per side,   forget about the number of reps that you're using.  When you can exceed, let's say, 10 reps per side,   you've got to increase the weight. You don't need  to go any more than three sets. You increase the   weight, so you continue to create more overload  as the muscle gets stronger. And while getting   stronger it can also help you to offload some of  the high force that the Achilles itself takes on",

Let me know how it works for you.  Jesse himself is actually going to incorporate   this for the next few weeks. We'll give you  an update on how it goes. If you're looking   for programs guys where we put the science back in  strength. You can head to athleanx.com.
