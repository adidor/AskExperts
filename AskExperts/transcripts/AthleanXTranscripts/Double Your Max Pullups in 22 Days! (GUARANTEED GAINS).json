        "text": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere. Athleanx.com. So  what are you doing for the next 22 days? Well, if   you're watching this video, I'm imagining you're  probably going to be doing some pull-ups. But I   will tell you this, on day 22, you're going to be  doing a hell of a lot more pull-ups than you are   right now. Both in a given single set of broken  and in a total workout. And we know how effective   this exercise is for developing upper bodies, so  on the other side of the 22 days are a lot more   gains, too. You see, this follows in the footsteps  of our ultra successful 22-day push-up workout.   Where I made a pretty big promise, I said by  the time you were done with those 22 days,   you'd be able to do more than one and a half  times the number of push-ups in a single set that   you were doing on day one. Well, it's time for the  similar promise here. A big promise. Not only will   you be able to do at least one and a half times  the number of pull-ups that you're doing in a   single set right now, it might be even up as high  as twice as many as that. So with that being said,   guys, I have a step-by-step plan to make sure  that you're not going to fail along the way.   So if you're ready to work, let's start laying  that you. Your workout is going to be broken   down basically into blocks. Five blocks of  four training days. The first day in a block   is a testing day. I'm going to explain what you're  going to do there in a second. It will be followed   by three non-testing days. All right, so, if you  look at this and you repeat this five times you   come up with 20 days. On day 21 and day 22, I'm  reserving those for our final tests. So what are   you doing in your given block? What happens on day  one on your test day? Well, the first thing you do   is you do as many pull-ups as you can in good form  to failure. Okay, all the way up till your chin   gets over the top of the bar, and all the way down  dead hang. Okay, then you take a two-minute rest.   After that point you come back and you  start a clock for five minutes. You have   five running minutes to do as many pull-ups as  you can. Understand you can get down off the bar,   you can rest pause, you can do whatever you have  to do. Just count how many pull-ups you do in that   five minute total. At the end of that testing day,  add up the original set that you did to failure,   plus the total number of pull-ups you did in that  five minute period, and that is your test day   total. Now keep in mind, you want to save those  two totals because this is what we're working   off of. You're going to see how many pull-ups you  did that in single set. That's what we're going to   improve in our final day of this program, and that  capacity to do more pull-ups is going to come in   really helpful again on that second to last day  of the entire 22 days. All right, so now days two,   three, and four are those non-testing days.  And what you do here is two exercises. One:   an accessory exercise to help us to be able  to do more pull-ups by the time we're done,   and you actually do more pull-ups. But the way you  do them is going to be different. Let's start with   the first non-pull-up exercise. It's a chin-up on  day two. And your goal here is to do twice as many   as the number you did to failure of the pull-ups  on day one or on that first testing day. And   the idea here is that you're not going to allow  yourself to actually go to failure. So if I did,   let's say, ten pull-ups to failure on day one,  I'm just looking to accumulate here 20 chin-ups.   And I stop short of failure. If I'm getting tired  around six or seven, I stop, I shake my arms out,   I get back up to the bar in ten seconds, and I  keep going until I've accumulated all 20 reps.   That's it. And then we move on to the pull-ups.  And with the pull-ups here, the idea is to take   that number from the first day-- if it was ten--  and now do 40% more. So if it was ten, we're   looking for four additional reps, 14 pull-ups  here, but done not to failure, done in the same   rest pause fashion holding a couple back that you  just did the chin-ups on. We proceed to the next   non-testing day. In this case now we're shipping  the focus away from the chin-up, which is more of   a bicep focus, to the forearms with our commando  pull-up. And we know that the forearms and the   brachialis are going to be contributing as well to  your ability to do more pull-ups, so that's why we   want to work them in. You do the same thing here.  Twice as many of the commando pull-ups as you did   on day one of your test day for your pull-ups.  So again, ten was the number. We're looking to do   20 here. And every time you come up to that bar--  whether it be on the right side or the left side--   that counts as a repetition. Once again, you  don't take it all the way to failure, you save   a little bit in the tank, you rest pause until all  20 are done. Now you go back and do your pull-ups",

        "text": "after a rest, and this time the goal is not to  add 40% to the original total, but to add 50%.   So again, starting with the ten-rep pull-up that  you did, now you're going to have to add five   more, so you're doing 15 today. We move on to the  next non-testing day, and this time we start with   something called the scap pull hang. Now, look,  if you're going to be hanging up on the bar longer   because you're going to be doing more pull-ups,  you got to get used to being up on the bar longer,   and that's where this exercise falls in. All  you have to do is set yourself up to the bar,   like this, and then consciously depress your  shoulder blades. Pull your scapula down and   back. Think about pulling your shoulders as  far away from your ears as you possibly can   and simply just hang there for as long as  you can. Again, building up your stamina,   and your endurance, and your ability to hang from  the bar. Now note the time that you are able to   hang here because I do want to see increases  along the 22 days in this asset as well. Because   if you can increase your dead arm hang time that's  also going to have some other benefits to the rest   of your workouts. But make sure that you're aiming  for at least a five second increase every time   you perform this. And we wrap up the second half  off our final non-testing day with, once again,   more pull-ups done in that same not to failure  fashion, but this time the increase is not 40%,   it's not 50%, it's 60% from the original day  one test total. Which means, that in this case,   you'd be doing 16. So now that comprises your  first block of training days one through four.   And as I mentioned in the beginning, this  is simply going to be repeated a total of   five times. However, the important thing to  note is that your test day sets the stage   for everything else that follows. So on day five,  your new test day, you get a chance to set a new   max for pull-ups in a single set. And all  of those non-testing days that follow,   the activities-- the chin-ups, the commando  pull-ups-- all of that is going to be based   off of the new test day total that you just had.  To insure that we're continuing to progress over   the course of the 22 days. As I said before,  when you encounter that bar hanging challenge,   you want to see if you can at least increase the  number of time that you can hang on that bar by   five seconds at minimum. You continue to do this  now all the way until you get to days 21 and 22.   And that's where our final two challenges are.  And on the first of which, we have our day 21   timed challenge. So you remember in the  beginning you did your set to failure,   your rested two minutes, you came back, you did as  many pull-ups as you could, and rest pause fashion   for a five minute period. You add in those two  numbers together, and I told you to remember that   number and to write it down. Because now I want  you to be able to take that total, that consisted   of the first set, a two minute rest, and then five  minutes, and now be able to do the whole thing   within five minutes. There's no two minute rest  period, there's no first set with additional time,   it's getting that entire total done now within  five minutes. And on day 22 our final test in   our 22-day pull-up workout, now you go back and  you try and set new standards. This is where it   all comes down to it. How many pull-ups can you do  in a single set? And this is where I'm looking for   at least a one and a half time increase, if not  twice as many, in that set. So again, if ten was   our number, you're looking for 15, if not 20. And  guys, if you've been putting in the work here, I   promise you, you're going to be surprised at what  you've capable of doing. So there you have it,   guys, a 22-day step-by-step plan that I guarantee  is going to deliver what I'm promising here,   it's going to get you doing a hell of a lot  more pull-ups than you are right now if you're   willing to put in that work. And that's the thing,  guys, whenever you're willing to put the work in,   the results of that hard work are soon to  follow.
