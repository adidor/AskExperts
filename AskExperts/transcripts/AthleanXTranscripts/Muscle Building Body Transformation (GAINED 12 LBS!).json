Yeah, I figured since I'm going to be working for a fitness company it's time for me to get in shape, get bigger, really utilize the program. I'm 5'10\", 140. That's my starting point. I'm hoping to gain some muscle, get a little bit bigger, some more definition, and see where I go from here. JEFF: It's funny because people say all the time \"Jessie's got a – he's so lucky. He's got it so easy. He's got Jeff as his trainer there all the time. Jeff can write custom programs for him. He can spot him. He can make sure…\" – I'm actually not doing anything for Jessie and there's a reason for that. Because I can't want his success more than he wants it. If he wants to do this he's going to have to figure out a way to do it. He's going to have to grow up. I get it. there's a lot of pressure and he's doing this on the big stage, and has a lot of people that are watching him try to make these changes. But at the same time I tell him \"Jessie, those same people, they're supporting what you do. They're watching you change. They're rooting for you. And that should be enough of a motivation to keep you on track, and to make sure that you don’t let them down. Most importantly, you don’t let yourself down.\" JESSIE: For the longest time I was never really willing to put in the work. I kind of just wished that it was given to me, but I realized that it's time to throw childish things aside, it's time to throw the gummy bears away so that I can grow up and start eating like an adult. Start acting like an adult. Understanding that what I want is not going to be given to me. I have to work for it. JEFF: There was nothing holding Jessie back except himself. For me, it's been really awesome to watch as that disappears, as his confidence grows, and he starts to realize just what he's capable of. The only thing I told him was, I said \"Jessie, if you're going to start then make sure you don’t stop. Make sure you see this all the way through.\" JESSIE: It's been such a positive experience and I appreciate that. I have to thank Jeff for lighting a fire under my ass, and guiding me that way. But in all honesty, I'm not doing it for him. I'm not doing it for his followers. I'm doing it for myself. While having them behind me is unbelievable, and it's great to have that support, the most important thing for me is to do it for myself, and for my own health, and for my own happiness. I've got to say: I'm not done yet.",
