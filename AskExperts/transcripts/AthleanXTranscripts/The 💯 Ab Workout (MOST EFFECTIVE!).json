        "text": "you're about to watch is going to be the most effective ab workout you've ever done how do I know that because I'm going to get you to focus on something called effective reps and all you're going to need to do this is just somewhere to hang from and a little bit of space on the floor so what are effective reps well unfortunately the the ones that you probably ignore right now the ones at the end of the set that create the most burn and discomfort well those are the ones that you actually need to learn how to do more of if you want to see better results and that's where the 100 ab workout steps in because I'm going to create a workout for you that's going to get you to these more effective reps more quickly with less wasted effort and it starts with our first of five exercises each one done for 20 effective reps before you guessed it a total of 100 and the first thing I want you to do is just get up on the bar and perform a hanging leg raise now don't get concerned about how many you can do I just want you to do as many as you can to failure [Music] thank you if you fail anywhere between 8 and 12 repetitions on this exercise then you are exactly where you need to be and you'll stick with this variation as we work on our effective reps if you fail in the one to seven rep range then we're going to modify the exercise you do for Effective reps to a simpler hanging knee raise if you happen to be able to do more than 12 repetitions to reach failure then we're going to increase the difficulty level of the exercise and perform a hanging scissor raise regardless of the variation that you wind up using the first set is just supposed to be taken all the way to failure for something we call the ignition set in other words kicking off the real work because the real work is now about to begin because at this point",

        "text": "you rest just 15 seconds and you get right back up on the bar and you perform a set and you start chipping away every single rep we perform at this point is going to be considered an effective rep every time you need to rest you drop down again for just 15 seconds and get right back up on the bar again you continue in this rest pause fashion until all 20 effective petitions are performed and then we head down to the floor for our next exercise and that's where we do an exercise called The Eccentric power up and for this we just need a dumbbell so what you're going to do for your ignition set is just choose a dumbbell weight that you think is going to get you to fail and that 8 to 12 rep range if after doing that first ignition set you're able to do more than those 12 repetitions then just swap it in for a heavier dumbbell if it's too hard for you either swap it out for no weight at all or a lighter dumbbell now on The Eccentric power up I want you to focus on not just driving that way up to get to the top of essentially a weighted sit up but to focus on slowing down your body back to the floor in other words work on The Eccentric control so your abs are getting worse both on the way up and on the way down and we know again with most of our sets that we do with traditional lab training we just kind of Blast Away through the Reps those first few are never that challenging it's at that point where they become challenging that a lot of us make the mistake of quitting and I'm trying to get you to actually lean in and do more of them so on this ignition set like always we perform this set all the way to that failure Mark where we can't do it another repetition in good form and we rest those 15 seconds at that point we get right back into it and again this is where the exercise begins this is where we have to start accumulating those 20 effective reps so I chip away maybe it's",

        "text": "four maybe it's five however many I can until I reach failure again I rest another 15 seconds I get right back into it continue until you've reached all 20 effective reps and we move on to the third exercise and for the last time back up at the bar and for that we're going to shift our attention just a little bit to the obliques because we know the waist tapering effect that they can have when we develop them and we're gonna do an exercise called The Hanging knee twist again this is the middle of the road exercise this is the one that we're all going to do for the ignition set the number of repetitions it takes you to failure is going to determine which exercise you do for the effective rep portion of it so if you take this set all the way to failure and you fall again in that 8 to 12 rep range you're good stick with this exercise for all 20 effective reps if this exercise happens to be too challenging for you and you can't perform at least 8 to 12 reps and just shift it down to this variation I'm showing you here and that will take you through as your variation for the effect of rep count if this exercise is too easy and there will be some of you out there that that's the case for then just up the intensity a little bit and perform the exercise like this moving your legs to the left and the right counts as one repetition here not one for each Direction remember the key to the effective rep workouts is making sure that your effort level is high so don't shy away from that burn as you work your way all the way till failure here in that ignition set and again remember as always to keep that rest tight just 15 seconds is allowed before you got to get back up on this bar and keep chipping away until those 20 effective reps are done and that's when we continue our assault here on the obliques with our fourth exercise this the Russian twist and press so once again you grab your dumbbell that's",

        "text": "appropriate or at least your best guess you perform that first ignition set taking it all the way to failure but remember to gauge where you failed if you fail in that 8 to 12 rep range and again you're good with the weight you're using if you happen to to not be able to get to those eight repetitions then just lighten the load a little bit and of course if you can do more than 12 repetitions just increase the weight of that dumbbell a little bit think of this as a built-in auto correct in other words you can't screw this up whatever you choose there's always a way to fix it and make sure you're on track speaking of which don't get off track or distracted because again remember 15 seconds is all you get before you have to jump right into those effective rep sets and remember as it was on the last exercise the left and right movement of the dumbbell here counts as just one repetition each time and that brings us to something we call the dumbbell drag and what we do is we get into a plank position with once again that dumbbell weight you perform your first ignition set again doing your best to guess the appropriate weight that you'll fail in the 8 to 12 rep range as always if you misjudge or a fatigue at this point just adjust that weight either slightly up or slightly down the nice thing about this plank variation is That's A variation of a plank because you guys know that I don't like the standard variation of the plank we are usually capable of doing so much more so why not do it and when we're talking about effective reps at least choose the most effective variations of the exercise to start for the ignition set and all Reps for that matter the movement of the dumbbell from the left and then back to the right counts as one repetition not one for each Direction left and right perform these like all the other exercises here until all 20 effective repetitions are completed and you're not done you see if",
