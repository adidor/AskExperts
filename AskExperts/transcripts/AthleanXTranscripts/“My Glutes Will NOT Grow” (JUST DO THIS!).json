        "text": "What s up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, athleanx.com. So,  if you can't get your glutes to grow, then this   is the video that you've been looking for. You  see, even if you're doing all the things right,   you're doing pull through because you watch this  channel before. You're doing barbel hip thrusts.   You're squatting, you're deadlifting, but nothing  is making your glutes grow. Well, there's a reason   for that. The best thing to do is test yourself  right off the bat. And that's what Jesse's down   here for. And that's what I'm inviting you to  do right now. Put your phone down, step away   from your computer, come down to the floor.  So, we get into an on all fours position here like   this and we're going to try to do is this straight  in one leg, we re going to test both of them,   but straighten one leg all the way back as far as  you can and lift it straight up to the ceiling.   And what I'm looking here for is an  intense contraction in the glute max,   right here. Do you feel that? It should feel  as if you just balled up your bicep and got as   intense a contraction as you possibly could.  If you don't feel that you definitely need this   video. Now there's a bunch of people that  probably don't feel it because they never   put the phone down and stepped away from the  computer to actually do this. Promise me you'll   do this at least when the video is done. But  of the people that do feel the contraction,   I call out at least three quarters of you, because  the only way that you actually felt it was by   turning the leg a little bit like that to do that.  So, check back and look around the corner and see,   is your toe pointing towards the camera? Or  was it done properly with the toe pointing   straight down to the ground and the heel up?  Because all you do is substitute the glute medius   into this that causes that lift, I want just  glute max. When you don't have good neuromuscular   control of the glute max, it takes a lot away from  those other exercises you've been doing already,   rendering them not as effective. And not only  that, it turns you into a back dominant extender   rather than a glute dominant extender. As soon  as you do that, and you perform those big unless   you're asking for low back pain. So how do  we fix all that? We can make you a dominant   extender and we could get really low back pain at  the same time that we grow your glutes. Meet me   over there I ll show you exactly what to do.  And so here we are at a pull up bar with a band   attached to it. Don't worry, if you don't have  anything at all, I'll show you something you could   do against a wall with just your own body. It will  become almost like rocket fuel for those bigger   lifts. We're not replacing those lifts with this  exercise, we're complementing it. And as you'll   see here in a second, it's the perfect complement  to what's maybe missing in those exercises,   which is why you want to focus on it. Even  the best athletes in the world perform this   exercise because they know how important,  bigger, stronger glutes are to performance.   We all can benefit from doing something for  our glute max here, that's how we do it.    So, we put our foot here into the band  that's looped over the pull up bar   and we let the hip rise up as high as  it possibly can, which puts us into a   good degree of hip flexion. That's important as  you'll see here in a minute. You push straight   down against the band down into extension.  And then when we get to this point here,   we're going to push against the band as hard as  we possibly can back in that direction. And also,   of course, lift the leg up against the downward  force of gravity, so you can really feel the group   backs working here. And then on the rotation going  on here like we would not want to do on the floor,   we just get good, isolated hip extension.  Some of the things you'll notice here, which is   why it's a good complement, as I said, you have  a lot of range of motion of hip extension here.   And it's not just this part from here to here.  That's the extended hip pass neutral. But hip   extension is happening all the way from the very  beginning of the exercise. Meaning you're going   through a position where the hip is in about a  110 degrees of flexion or 120 degrees of flexion.   All the way down through is 110 degrees  back through an additional 20 or so,   you're in about 130 degrees of resisted hip  extension. Also at the peak portion here,   the contracted position to fully extended the  position, you've got good tension here on the   glute max. At the top of a squat, not really.  You know, at the top of the squat when your hip is   actually just straight up and down, right through  parallel, through the downward force of gravity,",

        "text": "you don't necessarily have a lot of activation  of the glutes in that position. The last thing we   know is that in a typical squat, we get activation  of the quads at the bottom of the exercise.   What that does is it causes a little bit of a  conflict at the joint itself. Because we know   that we're trying to either flex the joint  or extend the joint. So, you start to get a   little bit of reciprocal inhibition of the glutes  because they can't do both at the same time. Any   time we're trying to cure a muscular inefficiency  problem like we are right here at the glute max,   you don't want to take anything away from  the muscle you're trying to improve.   So, in this case, we don't have the quad  contributing to the exercise as much   because we're not in that overloaded position  as we are in the downward position of a squat.   For all these reasons, guys make this exercise  part of what you do. Not a replacement for what   you're doing right now, but part of it and  I promise it's going to be rocket fuel for   the performance on those bigger lifts. But I  mentioned another way we can do this, and that's   up against the wall. I'll meet you over there.  What we do is we get ourselves up against a wall.   All right with the second leg, the one you're not  going to work you a fold it down and under. And   when we do is we fold it as much as we can because  you want to get as close as we can to the wall.   So, once we do, we scoot even closer to the wall.  What that does is it gives us more hip flexion.   The closer you can get, the more this hip is going  to come into flexion to mirror the benefits we get   from the banded of pulldown. So, from here now,  all we're going to do is focus on how we push   through the foot because it matters. If you were  to take the toe off of the wall and push through   the heel or maybe even pull down through the  wall, you're going to get far too much hamstring   activation here and that s not what we want.  We want glute max driving through hip extension.   So, we push the foot flat into the wall and  we try to push through every single inch   of the soul of our foot. And as we do it,  we pull up very slowly and slow and slow   and really try to drive through glute max. And we  hold for a second or two at the top, we come down   and we repeat driving through. Repetition count  here, like the other exercise guys, I don't really   care. It's high quality, good contractions. If  you're getting them, you keep going. If you're   starting to lose it or substitute, you stop.  Generally, this takes place in around the 10   to 12 range. And treat this like an  exercise. It s not simply a warmup.   If your glutes aren't responding right now, it s  because you don't have that good control of the   glute max and is not contributing as it should.  Make this muscle work. Treat this like an exercise   as it should be. Include it into your routine  and I promise you, this will start working.   Guys, if you're looking for programs  where not only the exercises matter,   but how we do them always matters.
