        "text": "fact that engaging in sex is going to drive higher testosterone levels which are going to drive gains in the gym is there anything to that you gotta stop for a second and realize I think there's some problems here okay all right the first thing is the research that has shown and there's not a lot of consistent research that talks about this but the research that has shown an increase in testosterone from climaxing through intercourse is basically talking about a 10 increase in testosterone 10 that sounds like a lot well when you realize that a man's testosterone level will fluctuate 20 to 30 percent up and down in a given day it's not that much anymore okay let's say a guy who has a testosterone level of 500 nanograms per deciliter his can go up as high as 30 up 650 or 30 percent down 350 in a given day depending upon the time of day and when you measure so when you think about a 10 increase and where that falls along that range it's not that significant and when you add on top of that the fact that this increase is a transient increase and I mean very transient 30 to 60 Minutes following climax through sex like how much of an impact is that really going to have in terms of actually leading to more muscle growth okay okay which brings us back to that other subject the Jim Bros the what was it Akbar Squad bar squat bars buddy he's telling him that he needs to engage in more sex because their sex lives are what's driving their muscle growth and that's why they've got more gains than he does that's what they're saying well there actually is research probably what they're reading that says that men who engage more regularly in sex have higher levels of testosterone but you gotta apply the chicken or the egg concept to that statement because think about this is it that sex is increasing his gym buddies testosterone levels or is it that they already have the highest testosterone levels probably why they",

        "text": "the things that come along with it I could argue that from a recovery standpoint you're more well positioned to make gains in the gym because of that right but the interesting side note of all that was I think Casey stangle is the one that directed his players away from having sex before games and it wasn't because as you he admitted later because he was worried about them having sex he didn't want what came in the pursuit of having sex in other words late nights out all night drinking trying to go meet up with people to have sex that was what he really was trying to discourage so in the end of it though I think it's pretty fair to say that when it comes to making gains in any type of climaxing whether it be through sex or through masturbation you're better off just attempting to make games by actually working out because if you work out and you build muscle you become more confident you get more attractive and you do something about your own body you're likely to put yourself in a position to actually have more sex Jessie uh I think it's been working for me well the games actually have been helping so guys if you want to have your question answered in a future axio video make sure you leave your question below and I'll try to get to it and make it the subject of a future one here also if you haven't done so guys make sure you click subscribe and turn notifications so you'll never miss a video we put one out alright guys see you soon don't have sex before a game or don't have sex before a fight right no they're just telling because they didn't want you to have to put any woman through that oh so listen [Laughter]",
