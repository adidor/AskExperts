        "text": "If you've got tight hamstrings then I promise  you, this can be the most helpful video that   you've ever watched. I'm going to take those  piano wires of yours that you got running up and   down the back of your leg, and we're going to fix  them and loosen them up in the next 22 days.    What s up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com.  So today I get to put on my PT hat and do one   of the things I like to do the most, and that's  to help you to fix issues, especially those   common issues that plague a lot of us. And  when it comes to tight hamstrings, a lot of   us are dealing with them. So, what if I told you  I can help you to fix them in the next 22 days?   That's right, I'm going to give you a game plan  that's going to do two things. Number one, it's   going to dramatically loosen your hamstrings and  we re going to have ways to objectively measure   that. It's also going to instill a stretching  habit that you can do and find very easy to   fit into your schedule no matter how busy you are.  And we're going to get the job done. So that said,   guys, I want to start breaking down what we're  going to do day by day to make sure that by the   end of this year, hamstrings are feeling a hell  of a lot looser than they are right now.    All right, so before we even get started here,  there is one disclaimer that I want to make sure   that they make as a physical therapist especially.  And that is if you look like this, that you likely   have a condition called anterior pelvic tilt. And  you would have tight hamstrings in this condition,   but it's not because the hamstrings are short,  is because your pelvis is pulling your hamstrings   into a position where they feel tight. So, what  I would advise is not to run into doing these   stretches to fix that problem. But rather  to go over that video and fix your anterior   pelvic tilt the way I show you there.  And so with that said, if you feel hamstring   tightness and you don't have that shelf, then  you can rest a glass of water on above your ass,   then you're in the right place. And when we have  to do is we have to start where we always do in   our popular 22-day series and that is with a  test. And this test occurs actually before you   even start on day zero. What I want you to do  is get yourself up against a wall like this,   lay on the floor and then extend the non-testing  leg until it's flat against the wall.   Now, with the other leg, you're going to pull  it back to a position of 90 degrees of knee   flexion and hip flexion. Not too much and not too  little, you want to get right at about 90 degrees.   From here all you're going to do is straighten  your knee out. And as you're doing this,   make sure that you're trying to keep  your toes always pointed to the ceiling   rather than pulling them back towards you.  Now, from here, I want you to basically visualize   a point on the wall that lines up with the  top of your toe. And this is going to give   us a chance to remeasure later on on day 22. Now,  it's a little bit easier if you have a wall that   would allow you to have a landmark that you  can actually find a little bit more easily.   But either way, all you have to do is stand up,  make that mark on the wall, put a piece of tape,   if need be, and you're going to come back to  that when you do remeasure on the last day.    But now we've got to get to the action and we're  to break this down over the course of three,   seven day blocks. So, day one through seven  will be blocked one day, eight through 14 will   be blocked, too. In day 15 through 21 will be  block three. Each block is going to consist of   ideally two sessions, one in the morning and one  at night. But before you get worried and think   I'm not going to have time at all to do this,  I promise you we're talking about just minutes   in the morning and minutes at night. The reason  for the split is that we want to focus separately   on our dynamic work and our static work. Because  we know that each time of the day we can have   a better impact if we do it that way. So, we start the day off with our dynamic   work and there's going to be just two stretches.  One that keeps the knees straight and one that has   the knee bent. And the reason for that is we  want to hit both functions of the hamstrings,   they don't just flex the knee, they help to extend  the hip so they can function to pull the hip back   into extension. We want to stretch them at some  point with the hip flexed. At the same time,   we have to focus on the exercise that straighten  the knee out. So that's we're going to do each   and every day throughout all of these blocks.  And at night we're going to shift our focus once   again to the passive stretching. And the reason  for this is that we get a better bang for our",

        "text": "buck when we perform our static stretches  right before bed. Especially if we train,   our body tends to heal itself a little bit  shorter overnight. So, by implementing these   stretches right before we go to bed, we tend  to get a little bit less of that shortening and   tightening and have a better long-term impact.  And so, with that said, let's start breaking down   the stretches and exercises that you're going  to do, starting in block one. Every morning,   on days one through seven, you're going to  do the following two exercises. Number one,   a leg swing, two different versions of  this. You're going to stand against a wall   and only go so high as you can that you can  still maintain a relatively straight knee.   Then we turn and face the wall and we do a side  to side. And here we're going to try to actually   turn our toe outward and turn our toe inward.  This is good because it helps us to get both   medial and lateral hamstrings a little bit more  specifically, but still, in this dynamic way.    You can do three sets of eight repetitions in  each direction on each leg. We move on to the   second dynamic stretch of the day and as is often  the case, the exercise is oftentimes the test.   What we did on days zero actually now becomes  something we can implement for the first seven   days here to try to increase the flexibility of  our hamstrings. This is the active knee extension   exercise. Now, you don't have to do it up against  the wall, you can simply do it down on the floor,   but the principle of the movement is the same. In  this case you try to hold that position for about   three to five seconds, you release, and you  go back and repeat. You do this for a total   of three sets of six reps on each leg and your  work for the morning is done, just like that.    But of course, we have one more session at  night, and that's where we're going to focus on,   that passive static stretching. As I said, it's  going to help us to increase those hamstrings,   flexibility. And the first exercise we're  going to do here is simply a standing low   hamstring stretch. And the idea here is to make  sure you're doing this properly. Because a lot   of us will simply fold over because we're  trying to stretch our hamstring, but that's   not actually getting directly at the hamstrings.  It s involving way too much low back. Instead,   focus on getting as tall as possible to establish  at least a temporary anterior pelvic tilt. Not one   of those structural ones we talked about before,  to increase the engagement of the hamstrings and   get them in a prime position for stretch.  Now, I simply just want you to reach your hand   out until you can feel your hamstrings light  up. You're just going to simply hold this   position for 45 seconds. You're going to do  two to three sets of 45 seconds on each leg,   maintaining the high chest and that slight arching  your low back for this to be effective.    And then we do the last stretch here on the floor  that's the knee bent position and this one is the   need a chest exercise. And all you can do is lay  back and pull back into your chest as far as you   can. You're going to feel this stretch a lot  higher up in the hamstrings, almost to where   they connect on the pelvis. You hold it for two  to three sets for 45 seconds on each leg in your   work for the day is done. Is this exact schedule  that you're going to perform for those first seven   days until we switch up the block on day eight? And speaking of day eight, that's the beginning of   our second training block, the one that we're  going to repeat all the way up through day 14.   And we start with our knee straight exercise,  the dynamic downward facing dog. And what I m   going to do is I'm going to actively drive my  knees, which are naturally bent here, to start   into a straight up position as possible.  Ideally, all the way straight. I'm going   to perform this as a set of eight and perform  three to four sets in total of the exercise.    Which brings me to my second and final exercise  in the morning. And this is the wall hinge.   This is that knee bent focus. So, we're going to  stand with butt our against the wall feet away   from the wall and have the knees slightly bent and  turned out. And the idea here is to get a really   nice stretch on the biceps femoris. And we could  do that by getting into a good hinge position,   maintaining that anterior tilt in arch in the  low back as I lean down. And I have the ability   to work on that mid belly muscle tissue quality  because my hands are free here and I can work   on doing cross friction massage across the muscle  belly during the stretch. Again, we perform this   as three to four sets of eight repetitions  and your work for the morning is done.",

        "text": "Which leads us to our pre bed static stretching  portion of our second block and it starts with   the wall stretch. And here I actually get to  take advantage of the wall as I use it to help   me to accentuate the stretch that I had from even  block one. I place one foot up against the wall,   actually this time incorporating a little bit  of calf into this, which is going to also be   beneficial since it crosses the knee. And I'm  going to get my chest to approach the wall and   have the wall to actually climb up to assist in  that process. Once again, we're holding this for   45 seconds to three sets on each leg.  From there we hit the floor and we want to   work on that knee bent position and we use a bend  now or a towel to assist. The idea being whatever   I could pull actively with my hands is going to  be increased because of the leverage the towel   provides in this stretch. So, we're stepping our  game up once again to allow ourselves to get that   deeper stretch, two to three sets once again for  45 seconds. We do this for the entire block.    And so on day 15, we begin our third and final  block. And the first exercise is the tabletop   side, to side stretch. What's interesting here, as  we've been doing over the course of the 21 days,   is we continue to up the ante of the stretch  this time, including the abductor's a bit.   You're going to want to have your hands parallel  to the floor. So whatever surface you choose,   you might have to be a little bit higher  or lower to accommodate that position.   At this point, what you re going to do is this  simply let your hands ride back and forth on   that surface as you do so, rotating your upper  torso. What that does is it allows that stretch   to carry down through the hamstrings. But we get a  little bit of a media lateral shift because of the   rotation from top to bottom. You're going three to  four sets of eight repetitions here on each side,   left to right, equals one rep. Again, we  have our second exercise and this time   it is the Bulgarian hamstring stretch. This  one leg position is going to allow us to   focus a little bit more directly on that single  hamstring so we could really focus on just one   side at a time. Go three sets of each leg, eight  repetitions, as we've been doing all along.    Which brings us to the nighttime portion of  our final stretching block. Our static focus   here is going to start with a doorway stretch.  You're going to sit with your hip right next to   the doorjamb. At that point, lay on your back  and lift the leg that's closest to the door   up against the jam itself. And by this point in  time, you're likely going to have a much easier   time getting your legs straight than had you  have tried this when we first started. That's   a good thing, improvements always good.  But now I want to make this even more of an   intense stretch. What I'm going to do is going to  reach through of my opposite hand, grab onto the   back side of that doorjamb and pull myself even  further into a stretch. You're going to hold this   for 45 seconds, as always, two to three sets on  each leg. And with that, we go back to the final   stretch of the session. Once again, maintain that  knee bent position with the hip in high flexion   actually done in a high position here. We  call this the standing high hamstring stretch.   So instead of focusing on keeping the foot  low and maintaining a straight knee here,   we're going to bring this up as high as we  possibly can and we're going to lean into it.   And as always, it got to maintain that  slight arch in your low back when you do this   rather than folding your pelvis underneath you.  Again, we do a two to three sets of 45 seconds,   really feeling that deep stretch right up  under your cheek if you're doing this right.   And just like that guys, in 22 days, I  promise you, if you can get consistent   with these stretches, you're going to feel and  see a difference very, very quickly. One of the   things people do is they give up on stretching  far too soon because they don't see the impact   that they want to see or feel, the impact that  they want to feel because they're oftentimes not   doing it right. We know the hamstring has two  major functions. We have to hit both of them,   and we know that, and muscle can be  stretched both dynamically and statically   and we're going to do those as well.  This entire 22-day plan is laid out here   for you guys step by step. I'm showing you the  screen shots so you can make sure you can take   them and implement them starting today.
