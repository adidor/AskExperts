        "text": "So, I got my test results back and they're not  looking too good. What's up, guys, Jeff Cavaliere,   Athleanx.com. So, yeah, what I hold in my hands  here are my test results and actually have   something to do with the reason why I'm wearing  this sleeve on my elbow and have been for a long   period of time. And what we're talking about here  is an injury to my bicep, to my elbow, actually.   And what happened was I was walking my son into  school back in February, it was icy out and   he slipped on the ice, and I was holding him and  essentially as he dropped down, I tried to quickly   grab him. Well, I felt this pain in my elbow  and I thought at the time that maybe it was a   supinator muscle strain deep inside my elbow.  It didn't concern me all that much because I was   able to still train. I was again, I'll throw a  sleeve around it and then keep going. And it kind   of holds a key part of my message here that  I want you guys to make sure you understand   and that is the concept of training through and  around injuries, which I'll get to in a second.   So, because we wanted to make sure we knew what  was going on, I had an MRI done. Well, in addition   to having the MRI on my elbow, being a physical  therapist and sometimes the worst type of patient,   you know, I said, Well, I do know that  anatomically, if I'm looking at my elbow, I   might want to check out my shoulder too. And given  the fact that I've had a long history of a lot of   shoulder problems dating back to the incident  with the New York Mets when I threw a baseball,   I'll tell you about that in a second. Not so well  by the by the way. I wanted to make sure we kind   of checked out what was going on there.  So we go to have the MRIs done and that's what   this is right here. I'm actually going to share it  with you guys here as we read along together. And   it turns out it's actually more interesting than  the elbow itself. So, what it's telling me here   is that I've got, as far as the rotator  cuff is concerned, a 50% thickness tear   in the supraspinatus tendon, which is actually the  muscle in the rotator cuff that is responsible for   external rotation or one of the three that are.  The infraspinatus and subscapularis are intact.   The AC joint, this little joint at the end of my  shoulder here has a little bit of a spur that's   coming down from underneath the joint with some  mild AC joint degeneration. The Bursae is fine.   The Glenohumeral Joint, interestingly has some  diffuse glenohumeral cartilage thinning. So,   on the head of the humerus up there with  some osteophyte formation or early arthritis.   The labrum, as we expected, has an almost complete  circumferential tear with only a small portion of   the superior labrum intact, which I definitely  could tell you from the second it happened.   The long head the bicep tendon is actually  fully intact and moderate to severe glenohumeral   degeneration, I'll get to that in a second.  So essentially in non-medical terms, this is   saying that I have the shoulder of a fucking  80-year-old man. Now for those that have never   heard this story, it all started with that throw.  So back in 2008, I was at spring training with the   New York Mets, just minding my own business out in  right field when one of our all-star outfielders,   Carlos Beltran, was walking by me. And I say, God,  it's surprising how much shorter it is to go from   right field to third base. It just looks so much  further on TV. So, he kind of looks at me and   he raises his eyebrows and says, You think it's  short from here, there? Why don't you try throwing   baseball and see if you can get it there?   So of course, not wanting to back down from   a challenge, I said, Well, I know I can get it  there. I just want to know who's going to catch   it when I throw it. So, he hands me the baseball  and says, I'll give you $1,000 bucks if you can   get it there on the fly. So of course, I wanted  $1,000 bucks. I grabbed the ball and I unwind   just an explosive throw. The problem is it sort  of died on the outfield grass somewhere behind   shortstop and the only thing explosive  was what happened inside my shoulder as   I completely tore my labrum and apparently my  rotator cuff, too. It's a good thing, though,   that I've got the MRI to remind me of how  bad my shoulder is supposed to feel, because   quite honestly, it feels pretty damn good. I come  into this gym every single night, 10:00, 1030,   after I put the boys to bed, and I train. And I  train hard, and I feel great. And I don't have   the limitations that the MRI is suggesting that I  have. And I think that's one of the things that I   want to get across to you guys are out the back  because a lot of us have been in the position   where we get diagnostic imaging that tells us  something that maybe we don't like to hear.",

        "text": "And the good news about that is that the  diagnostic imaging doesn't always support what's   clinically happening with you. So, a lot of times  there'll be imaging that says things look pretty   damn bad in there, but clinically you feel totally  fine. So are you supposed to start worrying about   what's inside the MRI report, or are you supposed  to maybe continue to do what you're doing because   clinically you're doing fine? Or the MRI will  say nothing's wrong with you, but clinically you   feel like shit. So, you know, is there nothing  wrong with you because the MRI says nothing's   wrong with you? I would disagree.  You know, I think that when it comes to   learning about what's actually happening to you,  you need to learn more about what's going on with   your own body. You need to become the master  of your own body. And one of the main reasons   that I have this channel, one of the very main  reasons I think, why we are as watched as we are,   is because I've always tried to give you guys the  understanding and knowledge. Look, I understand   you can learn a tip or two on TikTok in 10  seconds, right? I think the to inform people   so that they know exactly what's going on  with themselves so they can better prepare   for things like this and even have more  informed training approaches, you need to   get the education. You need to understand what's  happening. I've always tried to do that here.    So, using this MRI as an example, I'm going  to hope to do the exact same thing for you   right here. So, let's pretend that this is you,  right? What would you do? Well, if you don't have   an actual report or a visit to the doctor yet, I  think you should start there. And I'm saying that   as both a physical therapist and a member of the  medical community. But also, because I think at   least gives you a point of awareness of knowing  where to maybe start. Maybe where to start your   own Google searches because you know what you've  been told you have. But the next thing that we all   need to be able to do is quickly start to assess  what it is that we're having a problem with. What   is it that's causing pain and discomfort?  So, in the case of a shoulder, I want you to go   over and start bench pressing. Of course, I want  you to do it very light. What I want you to do is   just assess what you're capable of and what you're  not necessarily capable of pain free. And that's   beyond just doing a single exercise, we're talking  about breaking down the variations. So doing an   Incline Bench Press, doing a Flat Bench Press,  doing a Decline Bench Press and seeing which one,   if any, feels better or worse than the others.  And the reason why that matters is because when   it comes to the structures in your body, there is  a sensitivity to small things, even just like the   angle of the bench. Or the speed at which you move  the dumbbells or the barbell. Or to that point,   whether you use dumbbells or a barbell to perform  the exercise, all the little nuances matter.   And it's important that you don't just cross the  exercise off your list because you think that   doing one variation of the bench press means you  can't do any of them because that version hurt.   Once you do that, you want to take the exercises  that are problematic out of the equation. I'm   talking about the specific variations of the  exercises out of the equation. And the reason   why I say those can be removed, even though in the  same breath I'm saying you can train around this,   is because I know that there's so many other  variations of exercises that can do what you're   trying to do from the muscle benefit standpoint  that aren't going to be problematic.    There are thousands and thousands of exercises.  Some might say you have to do the squat, but if   the squat causes knee pain for you, I'm confident  enough to say you can do a squat pattern,   let's say squatting down to a box. It s a little  bit different than the squat, but the movement   pattern is the same, but completely eliminate any  of the discomfort that you have in your knees. So,   without having to say I can't squat anymore,  you're able to say I can squat this way,   at least for now, and maybe be able to resume  squatting fully as I get over this injury.    And one of the worst things you can do oftentimes  with any injury is don't do anything at all. So,   when you decide or maybe your doctor says, because  it's the easier recommendation to make, Listen,   don't do anything right now. Let it calm down.  I'll see you in four months. I don't think that's   the best approach to go because the disuse from  not using the muscle in any capacity oftentimes   leads to other repercussions and problems down the  road that you're going to have to try to undo and   those could be potentially even long term.  So, I would say that with the approach of",

        "text": "finding the right exercises, this MRI report  becomes a hell of a lot less meaningful.   Because once you have the exercises that are  able to be done, you continue to build them up,   you continue to build your strength up. That's  when you start to add your weight and build up   your strength in those exercises and always be  mindful of how you feel as you're doing them.   And as you do this, guys, you start to become a  lot more knowledgeable about what is right for   your body. I talked about it with this shoulder  injury. Again, you do not know me for any time   frame from my early days on YouTube, I had the  injury, but meanwhile I trained around it and   through it. Sometimes I had to abbreviate range  of motion. Sometimes I had to choose completely   singular exercises for a workout for my chest. At one point in time when this was inflamed,   actually, from demonstrating a muscle  up that really screwed this up again,   I decided to just limit my chest  training to Cable Crossovers.   You know what? It wasn't very exciting; it  was rather boring. But I was able to get   my chest engaged. I was able to get a complete  contraction and not have to give up on chest   training completely. And after a period of time  of limiting myself to just the crossover motion,   I was able to resume pressing without issue to the  point where I'm pressing now without any issues at   all. I can do any variation of a Bench Press, and  none of it hurts me at this point. And you have   to be prepared to play the longer game, right?  Doesn't have to be forever, but it may not be two   months or three months or even four months.  But as long as you're still able to train,   what does it matter, right? If you're still making  gains and I think I've continued to be able to   make gains throughout my entire career because  I've chosen smarter training methods. I've chosen   ways to still keep the flow going without  having to stop altogether. And ultimately,   that is the biggest tool that you can put in  your toolbox, is the ability to keep training.   To be able to choose the exercises that keep  you in the game, rather than opting to go sit   on the sidelines and get no results at all. So, guys, I hope you found this video uplifting.   I'm like you, I've got some of the same issues. I  get banged up, I get, you know, all kinds of aches   and pains. But I think that by having the training  approach that I use here, I haven't been out of   the game ever. I keep going. And I'm able to keep  going and have good energy and be able to attack   my workouts and make the right decisions along  the way, because I've allowed myself to become   more knowledgeable about what my body is actually  doing. And I've taken the right steps in whatever   training I do to ensure that I'm not taking steps  backward, but more so always taking steps forward,   even if by just this much every single day.  If you're looking for programs, guys,   where I try to empower you with the same ability  to keep going no matter what and still make gains,   I've got them all over at Athleanx.com.
