        "text": "What s up guy's Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com. WhatÂ  you're about to watch is the most effective chessÂ Â  workout you've ever done. As a matter of fact,Â  I'm going to lay it out for you step-by-step soÂ Â  that there's no guesswork at all. And we callÂ  this the 100 Chest Workout. We're kicking off aÂ Â  brand-new series here that is going to become yourÂ  go to and favorite chest workout. Now, guys, howÂ Â  does this workout work? Well, because we focus onÂ  effective reps. And if it's not something you'veÂ Â  done before in your training, you've likely leftÂ  a lot of results on the table there. Now guys,Â Â  the concept of effective reps is actually nothingÂ  new. As a matter of fact, Arnold SchwarzeneggerÂ Â  knew all about this years ago. So how can weÂ  increase the number of those effective repsÂ Â  that we do and eliminate a lot of the work that weÂ  use to get to those effective reps? Well, that'sÂ Â  where the 100 Workout series steps in now. Now asÂ  always, guys, we're going to put the science intoÂ Â  everything that we do. So, for a chess workout,Â  we're going to want to follow the fibers and hitÂ Â  the three different areas of the chest. FirstÂ  of all, we're going to hit that middle sternalÂ Â  area of the pec. And we're going to do that withÂ  exercises that both take you to an across midline.Â Â  We're going to hit the upper chest as well, theÂ  clavicle fibers. And once again, we're going toÂ Â  take exercises that take us through this low toÂ  high and up and across position of the arm. Â  And then finally, we're going to hit thoseÂ  abdominal fibers or the lower portion of theÂ Â  chest. And once again, we're going to bury theÂ  arm angle to go from a high to a low position.Â Â  But again, that's just the anatomy coveringÂ  the bases. How do we do it is where it reallyÂ Â  counts. And the first exercise up is goingÂ  to be a standard Dumbbell Bench Press. Now,Â Â  what you want to do is you want to take a weightÂ  that will cause failure in the 12-rep range.Â Â  As you see me here, I'm going to lay down andÂ  perform my first set. This is called the ignitionÂ Â  set. All you're doing is taking the set to aÂ  failure. Now, when I get to the end of the set,Â Â  I'm going to sit up and stay in place, but restÂ  for 15 seconds. Everything from here on outÂ Â  is going to be a rest/pause. As soon as the 15Â  seconds are up, I'm going to lay back down andÂ Â  start repping out again. Now, obviously, I stillÂ  have the fatigue that accumulated from the firstÂ Â  ignition set, which is going to limit the numberÂ  of top end reps that I can do. But it's going toÂ Â  put us into that effective range much quicker. IÂ  perform as many reps as I can here until failure,Â Â  and I rest another 15 seconds. I get right backÂ  into the next set and I rep out again. Again,Â Â  this time likely fewer reps to failure.Â  Maybe three, maybe four, even maybe less. Â  It doesn't matter. Your goal for the exercise isÂ  to accumulate 20 ERs or 20 effective reps. OnceÂ Â  you've hit your 20 reps, you're done with thatÂ  exercise. Now, how does this compare to, let'sÂ Â  say, a standard four sets of 10 reps? UsuallyÂ  in those 10 reps you get those last two thatÂ Â  are the hardest. Well, that would give you eightÂ  effective reps in a standard four sets of 10.Â Â  In this case, you're getting right back into thoseÂ  effective reps every single time you get out ofÂ Â  your 15 second rest/pause more quickly accessingÂ  those type two fibers and inducing more growth.Â Â  Now, here we go now to the next exercise. And hereÂ  I always talk about having to complement any typeÂ Â  of pressing exercise for your chest with someÂ  sort of cross midline adduction. Because I knowÂ Â  that the chest has that function and capability,Â  we have to tap into it. So, I'm going to haveÂ Â  a standard Cable Crossover and we're going to doÂ  it again at the level of the chest. Keep in mind,Â Â  you still want to make sure that you get thoseÂ  hands all the way across midline and not justÂ Â  to midline to fully engage the chest. Now,Â  once again, I'm performing an ignition setÂ Â  with a weight that will take me to 12 rep failure.Â  As soon as I get there, I'm going to wait that 15Â Â  seconds, put myself right back in position againÂ  and start counting out those effective reps andÂ Â  continue until you've reached 20 once again.Â  Now we go to the third exercise in this workout,Â Â  and this is now back to the bench press for anÂ  incline bench press variation that we have thatÂ Â  we call the Thumbs Up Dumbbell Incline Bench. And what we're doing by driving our thumbs up asÂ Â  we lift is we're allowing for more adduction or aÂ  closer proximity of the dumbbells to each other asÂ Â  we press. You should feel a heightened engagementÂ  in the pecs. And also, because we're going fromÂ Â  that low to high position on the incline of aboutÂ  30 degrees, we're going to more effectively targetÂ Â  the upper chest fibers. Now, for some reasonÂ  if you don't have access to an incline bench,",

        "text": "you're not getting out of this one. Scott Free.Â  You've got an alternative. Perform the flat benchÂ Â  with the underhand grip position like I've shownÂ  you before, to effectively target the upper chestÂ Â  fibers and maybe even stick one plate under theÂ  bench to create somewhat of a slight incline.Â Â  Once again, the key to the effectiveness of thisÂ  exercise and the entire workout, for that matter,Â Â  is to choose the right weight for that 12-repÂ  failure to start that ignition set. Now, everyÂ Â  subsequent effort is going to be your all outÂ  maximum and that's part of the reason why, guys,Â Â  we call this the 100 Workout, putting everythingÂ  out there. For the third time in a row here,Â Â  guys, we're going for those 20 accumulatedÂ  effective reps. Now we move on to that lowerÂ Â  chest. Right, because we still have to hit that,Â  and we want to do that with our classic Dip. Â  But what I want you to do is choose a WeightedÂ  Dip if able, because I want you to take thatÂ Â  12-rep failure mark. If bodyweight alone is enoughÂ  to cause you to fail in that rep range than bodyÂ Â  weight is fine, but perform the way to dip andÂ  as always, rest those 15 seconds. Now from here,Â Â  we're going to change the number and change theÂ  effect. I want you to go down and perform a PauseÂ Â  Dip at the bottom three second holes with thatÂ  same weight, obviously. And we're going to find isÂ Â  that that stretch tension, which is a great driverÂ  of hypertrophy, is going to take this to anotherÂ Â  level of intensity. So, you may only get one orÂ  maybe two reps after reaching failure and restingÂ Â  only 15 seconds. And that's fine because I'm goingÂ  to accommodate that by lowering the effective repÂ Â  count from 20 down to 10 on this exercise. AndÂ  then we move on to the fifth exercise here, whichÂ Â  is actually one of my favorite ways to perform aÂ  crossover. And it's something that I came acrossÂ Â  recently. We call it the Omni Crossover, so IÂ  set one cable high and one cable low. The oneÂ Â  that's low is going to come up and across my bodyÂ  more effectively targeting the upper chest. AndÂ Â  the one that's high is going to be brought fromÂ  top down across my body to more effectively hitÂ Â  the lower chest. Now, what I do is I make anÂ  accommodation in the weight. I have at leastÂ Â  20% to 40% more weight in the hand that's goingÂ  from the top down than the one coming up. Â  The upper chest is going to be weaker than theÂ  lower chest operating from top down, so make theÂ Â  adjustment in the stack accordingly. And what IÂ  do is I'm going to take that first set and performÂ Â  these crossovers to failure. Once I've reachedÂ  failure, as always, arresting those 15 seconds andÂ Â  the action begins until I accumulate 15 effectiveÂ  reps in that combination. But of course, I'm notÂ Â  done because I have to change the orientationÂ  of the arms to put whatever one was high to lowÂ Â  position and whichever one was low to the highÂ  position and work the same thing. Do anotherÂ Â  ignition set and follow it with 15 effective repsÂ  of that combination. But the 100 Chest WorkoutÂ Â  isn't done just quite yet because for those trulyÂ  psychotic out there that want that final nail inÂ Â  the coffin, I got it for you, we call it Hell onÂ  100. So, what you're going to do here is performÂ Â  20 Static Hold Pushups. And this is effectivelyÂ  a metabolic burnout that's not only going to testÂ Â  your muscular endurance, but more importantly,Â  your mental toughness. And what we're going to doÂ Â  here is perform a pushup by lowering yourselfÂ  down into that static hold position for 5 seconds.Â Â  After you've held for 5 seconds, you come up andÂ  perform your first pushup, lower yourself backÂ Â  down for five more seconds. After 5 seconds, youÂ  come back up to perform your second pushup. Â  The goal here is to accumulate 20 pushups, whichÂ  means you're going to have to have a cumulativeÂ Â  100 seconds of static holding. Now, keep in mind,Â  this does not have to be done all in one shot.Â Â  You can rest/pause your way to that goal as youÂ  did throughout the rest of the workout. Again,Â Â  these are optional and not for the faintÂ  of heart. But remember, guys like Arnold,Â Â  if you want to get the most out of your workout,Â  you've got to be willing to push yourself there.Â Â  And we say, don't count the reps and make theÂ  reps count, well, I think here you can countÂ Â  the reps that actually count. And when you doÂ  that, guys, the results will be next level.  Â  If you're looking for more in this series,Â  guys are going to make sure I link them atÂ Â  the end of these videos as they come out. But inÂ  the meantime, if you want to take a screenshot,Â Â  here's your opportunity. As always, guys, IÂ  want you to have the chance to take this withÂ Â  you to the gym so there's no guessworkÂ  and you can get the results that I knowÂ Â  you're going to get if you put the work in.Â  Guys, if you're looking for a full program,",
