        "text": "from because all of these exercises see if you can tell the limitation on all of them from the flat bench press to the incline bench press to the dip they're not crossing midline and we know that the action of the PEC at the shoulder has capability to take this arm not just through adduction but across and horizontal adduction across midline and all those exercises are limited by the fact that they don't take you even to midline let alone across it so how would you construct a better chest workout what you'd want to do is you'd want to take those exercises and follow them immediately with a drop set of an exercise that's going to do that so let's go back to the flat bench press we go immediately from our flat bench press here to a horizontal cable cross over now that again people might even say - there's a lot of fans in the cable crossover saying that it's a better chest activator from EMG studies then what a flat bench press is doing but guys if you rely on energy studies and you wind up saying things like that and don't understand that though it may have a better percentage of activation it's still not capable of being loaded to the extent that a barbell bench press is therefore limiting its ability to be effective it's if it's the only thing you do but if you do it in addition to the bench press you're getting the benefits of everything so now we take that we drop right into this horizontal cable crossover and we can see that we're actually now taking our arm all the way through and crossing midline and getting that complete activation of the chest in that plane of motion so we don't have to stop there though because we can do different planes of motion because this shoulder is a three-dimensional joint we can hit any angle we want so if we go back now we do our incline bench press and when we're done with that we don't rest we immediately go back over to the crossover and we change the orientation so that our arms can go through this low to high arc and again we're not we're not going to stop where we would stop on a bench press on the incline bench press what we're going to do is we're actually going to take the arm to midline and through midline and you can see again the degree of contraction and complete contraction we're getting up the chest by doing so it's a difference maker guys when you actually implement it and we're go to the dip the same thing our hands are actually fixed on a dip as well we can't get our hands to come towards mid line because the dip station just allows them to stay in one position but we can take the dip we can load it up we can use weights we can do whatever we want to create overload with that exercise as soon as we're done we come back over here and now we change the orientation of the cables once again to go from high to low and once again it's not just getting the midline but it's crossing through midline to get a complete contraction of the chest an essential element for a complete chest workout and again one extra exercise here I'll push up one that we do a lot I'm sure you don't have to stop with just the push shell because we're being limited once again by the fact that our hands are in contact with the ground and cannot get across our body so we use the push-up into this banded push-up where Ashley can come up and drive one hand across the body to create an abduction across midline right one arm staying down in contact with the ground the RL arm goes across of course we want to switch sides and work both sides here but this is how you complete the development of your chest by including exercises that can be loaded by including exercises that take the muscle through its full range of motion and of course applying full range of motion to all of the exercises even if they are limited in how much complete",
