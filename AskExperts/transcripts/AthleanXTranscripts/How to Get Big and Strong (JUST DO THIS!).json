        "text": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere. Athleanx.com.  So you want to get bigger and stronger. It's   actually really, really simple. There's only  way to do it, and I suggest you go talk to   this guy. Listen, dude, I got some goodies in here  right here for you. This is what I use. I got some   farm school grade HDH low dose. And dude, best of  all, low grade beaver tranquilizer. You want any?   I'm good, man. What do you mean you're good? I'm  good. Bro, these are gains! Do you want gains? You   don't want gains?! This is where your gains are!  In this bag! Actually, he might make you think   that that's the only way for you to get bigger  and stronger. But there's a hell of a lot more   ways to do this, especially if you apply a science  to what it is that you're doing. And, guys, that's   what I want to make sure I do here for you today.  Because it's as simple as two words-- progressive   overload-- but how we define that and the ways  we get there is what matters. And a lot of   people will make you believe that the only way to  progressively overload and get stronger and bigger   is to just simply add weight to the bar. That is  not all the options you have here. I'm going to   show you guys so many more ways to do this that  will help you to have a better understanding,   and therefore have a better game plan for getting  there faster. All right, so the first thing you   need to do is you need to be willing to define  your specific goals. Right, don't just lump them   together-- strength and size-- because we know  that they are different. Creating muscle growth   can take us down different paths. We can introduce  light weights and do them for much higher reps   and still get muscle growth whereas it wouldn't  really affect our strength levels. And likewise,   we can pursue strength, which might limit the  number of progressive overload options we have,   but it doesn't necessarily mean that we're going  to get size increases, especially if we're past   the stage of newbie gains. So be willing to define  what it is you're trying to chase. And it's okay   if we're trying to chase both. Just understand  that there might be different ways to get to   each of them more efficiently. And on that note,  guys, step two here is to realize that not all   the techniques that I'm going to show you here  are going to work optimally for every exercise.   And for that reason, I'm going to pit two entirely  different exercises against each other to showcase   the strengths and weaknesses. We'll take a  simple exercise here like the dumbbell curl,   and we'll put it head-to-head up with, let's say,  a heavy compound movement like the dead lift.   And realize that each of those is going to  provide us with a lot of similarities in how   we can create progressive overload, but  also some important unique differences.   All right, so with lots to cover here, guys, let's  get started right off with the most obvious way to   create progressive overload, and that is simply  adding more weight to the exercise that you're   performing. So if it's the curl, increasing the  weight of the dumbbells that you're curling is   going to increase the strength of your biceps on  that exercise. Ad we know, again, that it doesn't   just apply to this variation of the curl, a lot  of times strength is generalized. It will occur   through other variations. Even if we broke  out a bar bell we would see some increases   in strength that carry over. But the principle  itself also applies here to our compound lift.   Right, simply adding more weight to the end of  this bar bell, and performing a dead lift is   going to increase my strength. As I am able to  do heavier and heavier weights, my strength is   increasing. It's important to note here, guys,  that it's not just relative to your one-rep max.   Matter of fact, a lot of guys won't even ever  touch their one-rep max unless they're competing.   It can apply to a three-rep, a four-rep,  a five-rep, even higher rep levels.   As you're able to do more weight at those levels  you are getting stronger. The important point   is that you're progressively adding more  weight to the bar at any given rep range,   therefore increasing your strength. All right, so  the next one here is actually a bit controversial   because I feel like people throw this word  around as if it's the holy grail of training,   and that's volume. Simply increasing volume  doesn't necessarily need progressive overload.   Because I could just increase a bunch of junk  volume, low effort, low intensity volume and not   necessarily see any increase in gains in strength  or muscle mass. That being said, if we're going to   take an example like this where we have five sets  of three done with a sufficient intensity of 85%,   you would see that I will have lifted a certain  amount of weight by the time that workout is over.",

        "text": "And if instead we increased the number of sets we  did with the same exercise, and the same weight,   at the same intensity level, here we look at it  increase in the number of pounds that we lift by   the time the workout's over. That is a form of  progressive overload. But again, it's dependent   upon the intensity at which we're training. With  that being said, guys, I got more to say on that   in point number three. And that point is in the  realm of strength training prescription. When   we're talking about intensity we're talking about  a percentage of the lift that we're performing.   That being said, I also like to make sure  that we point out simply effort level. How   hard are you trying? If you're looking to  create a progressive overload, take whatever   effort you provided last time, and do more the  next time. In other words, look at this curl.   If you look like this when you're curling, I'm  sorry, but there is no opportunity here for you   to really push yourself and create any substantial  growth. Certainly not in any significant way when   it comes to progressive overload. What you need  to do is you need to start pushing more. You need   to start putting more effort to what you do. This  is an example of what it would look like. There's   more effort being performed here. I think if you  did nothing else but simply up the effort level   of the exercises you're performing, you would find  an amazing opportunity to add both more strength,   because you'd be more focused on the thing  you're doing, and more size because you'll   be putting more into what you're doing, and in  both cases, see gains. All right, so the next one   here actually doesn't have anything to do with  the weight that you're lifting, but more so the   time that you're resting in between sets. You see,  your inter-set rest period can actually be a great   opportunity for you to create overload by simply  decreasing it. See, if you took protocol one here,   you just did a five by three, at a certain level  of intensity, that is going to remain consistent   between protocols. And you added four minutes of  rest between sets. This total workout would take   you 18 and a half minutes. If, on the other hand,  in protocol two here you decrease that inter-set   rest period by just one minute to three minutes,  you see that that total time of the workout would   be just 14 and a half minutes. You save four  minutes. However, your output was the same.   For you create that same output in a shorter  period of time is going to be a heightened demand   on the muscles that created that output. There is  more stress being applied to you and your body,   and therefore a progressive overload, and we  didn't even have to touch the weights that were   on the bar. We just had to manipulate how long  we were resting in between those sets. All right,   method number five we're creating more  progressive overload in your workouts.   It's simply to increase the range in motion of  the exercises that you're doing. Now how does that   work? It's not always a given that that's going  to actually create any increase overload. Why?   If I were to do a tricep kickback, I've talked  about it before, bringing your arm up closer to   your chin on a tricep kickback before you kick  it back is doing nothing to increase the demand   on the triceps. If anything, it's actually just  increasing the demand on the biceps. So that means   nothing is actually being achieved here. But  if the exercise itself is being preserved,   then more range of motion means that the weight  has to travel a longer distance, meaning that more   work is done and you're creating an opportunity  for overload. If we took the curl for example,   what we would do here is something called a one  and a half rep curl. So if I take the weight from   point A to point B from the bottom to the top,  instead of just stopping there, if I go back   down halfway to point C, and then I come back up  to the top, every single repetition has now become   one and a half. There is more work being done on  every rep than there was in a single up and down.   If we would apply this to a deadlift, the best  way to do it would be with a deficit deadlift.   Simply standing on top of something to create a  longer range in motion for that bar. You can see   here on a standard deadlift that the bar sits  about eight and a half inches off the floor.   For me, when I get it to the top, it's traveled a  total of 28 inches. That gives us a displacement   of that bar. If I simply stand on top of a  two-inch plate, and perform the same lift,   that displacement has increased. Right, I have to  overcome the additional two inches. What that does   is I've had to move this bar an additional  10% or more to perform the same exercise.   That is a form of increased overload. Even though  the weights stay the same, the travel was longer,",

        "text": "the work perform was more, that's a way that you  can actually progressively overload this exercise,   again, without having to change the weight at  all. All right, with method number six we actually   now can impact the range of motion without  changing or adding any range in motion at all.   All we have to do is increase the effectiveness  of the range in motion we're training in.   And that's where accommodating resistance and  strength curves matters. So if you look at this   dumbbell curl, we realize that the dumbbell  itself provides a level of resistance that's   toughest in the middle of the exercise. Whereas  if we use the band we know that the bands get   most difficult at the top of the exercise. Well,  if we actually combine the two like you see here,   we're actually now increasing the effectiveness  throughout more of the range of motion. Right,   we're loading it in the middle, and still loading  it at the end because we're overlapping the two.   That is going to create an opportunity here for  progressive overload. We can also do the same   thing here with a deadlift. If I took chains and I  added them to the end of the bar, we're not having   to lift the weight of the chains until we get  towards the top. As the deadlift gets easier,   the amount of the weight of chains becomes  more of a factor. As they become unraveled   and hang more we have more weight of the chains  to lift, that is helping to, again, build a   complimentary strength curve. Use accommodating  resistance to take the same exercise with   additional implement incorporated into it and make  it more difficult with more progressive overload.   Method number seven has to do with the pace  at which you perform your lift. Pacing can   be something incredibly effective for creating  overload. Look, if I told you to do an air squat,   you'd probably say, That's not really hard at all.  But if I told you to do a wall sit and stay there,   how long could you actually sit there? It's going  to become more difficult because you're accruing   time under tension. Well, I can incorporate a  pause into any lift I do, but we can apply it   to the two that we're focusing on in this video.  And that is firstly with a dumbbell curl. If I   simply paused in the middle, the hardest portion  of the range of motion, we can make this curl more   difficult. Simply bring it up, pause, then come  to the top, come all the way down, and repeat.   That is going to increase the time that we are  feeling that tension on every single repetition,   make it more difficult, and create more overload  than had we just done it in a standard up-down   fashion. With a deadlift we have the same  opportunity here. We could do a pause deadlift.   You rip that thing off the floor, but you stop  below knee level, and you hold the bar to be   able to reinitiate without momentum-- we're going  to get into that next-- and pull that bar all the   way up to the top. Again, more overload than  had you just ripped the bar from the floor   without stopping. So I mentioned momentum, let's  talk about it with our eighth technique here,   and that is we want to reduce the momentum in  the lift. We can create progressive overload   if we take out the urge to let momentum  take over. If I took that dumbbell curl,   and instead of doing it one arm at a time where  I have the benefits of getting into a rhythm and   generating some good momentum as I lean into that  working arm, we could do them two arms at a time.   This actually eliminates a lot of that momentum,  forces us to move more weight and control more   of that weight with our core, which makes this a  more difficult exercise. If you haven't tried it,   just try it, and you'll feel that right away. We  can apply the same thing here to the deadlift as   well. I'm sure you've seen people do touch  and go deadlifts, which will look this,   or a regular deadlift. Now, the touch and go  deadlift is not something that should be avoided   altogether. It depends on what you're training  for. If you're looking for more of a metabolic   effect from the deadlift, you can use a touch  and go form. If you're looking to create overall   strength from the exercise, then you're going  to want to stop on every single repetition.   Pull from the floor from a dead stop, hence  where the name comes from. Either way,   if you were used to doing touch and go deadlifts,  and you switch to a regular traditional deadlift,   you are going to have effectively an  increased overload. So there you have it,   guys. Getting bigger and stronger can actually be  boiled down to two words, progressive overload,   and it also relies, again, on the goal that you  have set for your own training. It's possible to   do both, but it's always more easily achieved if  you have a game plan for getting there. And when",
