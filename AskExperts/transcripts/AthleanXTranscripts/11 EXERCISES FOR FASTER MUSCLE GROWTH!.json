        "text": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere. Athleanx.com.  Today, we're going to cover 11 exercises that   allow you to tap into one of the most overlooked  and underutilized muscle functions to get better   results. It's called the stretch reflex.  So today we're going to go through that oh,   why are you back here again? Oh dude, stretch  reflex. I'm What are you doing? I'm stretching.   It's not that kind of stretching. It's not? No.  Oh, this is going to make my intro really awkward.   Feel good now? 11 exercises, guys, handpicked  because they provide you with the best opportunity   to tap into that stretch reflex, which creates  a greater potential for muscle recruitment and   an overall better gain. So with that being said,  guys, we're going to cover every single muscle   group in the body here one-by-one. Let's start  breaking them down. So now the stretch reflex is   actually something we all have. It's just that  we're not really tapping into it if you don't   know how to. You see, to protect the mechanism  that our muscles have, that allows us to get a   better strength of contraction when the muscle  is momentarily stretched to its limits. And we   can do it by actually doing it purposefully,  right, building it into the exercises that we   do. So one of the best ways to do this if we're  talking about our triceps is to do something like   the lying triceps extension. Now there's a reason  why this works better than anything else because   it takes the tricep muscle through a full stretch.  See, if you just did this, this is the tricep push   down. You can see that while I'm getting a stretch  because the elbow is flexing as much as I can, I'm   actually not getting a full stretch of the tricep  because the long head requires that my arm be up   and over my head like this. It's not happening  here. So, the right one is this, the lying triceps   extension. Because here I not only get the elbow  to be bent as much as I can, but I get the elbow   up and over my head that recruits that long head  arm stretch. So here's what we're going to do,   you're going to take this exercise and do it one  of two ways. Either you do it just like this,   which means you get down to the bottom here, go  into a full stretch, and then turn that around as   quick as possible. Get into the stretch and out of  the stretch to elicit that stretch reflex. If you   want to do this in a more advanced level then you  would do this. You take your rep all the way down,   you come up one quarter, hold for a brief  second, and then allow sort of a drop into   that stretch reflex and come out of it. It becomes  a little bit more ballistic at that point. Again,   more for the advanced people who have actually  had experience with the stretch reflex,   but the fact is you could do it either way. If  you want to get the triceps to have a stronger   strength in contraction and greater overall gains,  then this is what you do. Now when it comes to   the biceps, the exercise of choice here is the  incline bicep curl. Why? Because it gives you   that opportunity to put the biceps in a stretch  position. Anything done standing is going to start   with your arms out in front of your body, or at  best, at the side of your body. But if we can   get our arms back naturally behind our body, then  we've already started to tap into that stretch,   but how we do the exercise matters. See, because  if you do your incline curls like this, you're   actually never even allowing the bicep to get into  a stretch position at all. And a lot of people do   this, they cut short the bottom range in motion.  So to do this the right way, what you do is you   make sure the arms are sinking all the way back at  the bottom. And again, you want to make sure that   you get out of this position to apply that stretch  of the biceps. We could do something extra here,   which is another way to utilize the stretch  reflex, and that is to contract the antagonistic   muscle, in this case the triceps. We know that if  we can contract the triceps we have to momentarily   relax the biceps to allow for a greater stretch.  That momentary contraction of the triceps gives   you that relaxation in the biceps, that triggers  a stretch reflex, which allows for that greater   strength in contraction out of the bottom. In  the advanced version we'll do the same thing.   You come down to the bottom, up a quarter, hold it  for a brief second, drop down into that position,   get that tricep contraction, and bounce right back  out of it again. Either way, it doesn't matter   which one you do or where you're starting from,  they're both going to work to get those biceps   contracting harder. So now when it comes to the  back, I actually got three exercise options here   for you. Because you want to stretch the back  out you got to make sure that you get your arms   up out in front of your body. And there's no  easier place to start than right here on a lap",

        "text": "pull down. But you're not going to do this.  You're not going to do the overhand lap pull   down. Now there's nothing wrong with this. I've  done this exercise a million times and love it,   but when you're trying to tap into the stretch  reflex, then you've got to switch your hands to   this position. Why? It's not just about the hands,  it's what happens to your arms when you do that.   Your arms come out in front of your body. And we  know that since the lats attach to the upper arm,   going from a position of here to here creates a  bigger stretch on the lats without even doing any   of the reps in the exercise. So when we do this,  now we come down, and we can do them in the same   way. We either can do them the standard way of  going into that stretch position at the top and   trying to quickly reverse the direction back down  again. Remember, get that momentary stretch, take   advantage of that built in function of our body,  and get back down into a stronger contraction on   that lat pull down. If, however, we want to go in  and do this with a little bit more advanced way,   we can just make sure that we get it up there  again. Remember, pull down just a little bit,   hold for a second, let it fall up to the top,  and pull down again. Now we can do this to other   exercises. One of the ways I like to do it is with  the seated row. And maybe you might have noticed   when Jesse did the exercise the handles weren't  at the level of his midsection or at his chest,   they're actually much lower, why? Because if  we allow ourselves to get our hands down low,   out in front of us, because we're leaning  forward it's actually creating a relative   elevation of our arm, more stretch on the lats. As  you see here now, with me being in this position,   I can get that stretch and I can take advantage  of the stretch reflex by being a little bit   aggressive as I get towards the end of that  repetition. Remember, allow the stretch to take   me through that full stretch and come back into  a stronger, more powerful contraction. The second   version of this would once again be get the hands  up, hold for a brief second, allow it to drop, and   then come back into a more powerful contraction.  The last exercise is one that I actually credit   to my friend and colleague John Meadows, and it's  the Meadows Row. But instead of doing it this way,   if you want to take advantage of a greater stretch  reflex, then what you have to do is just apply the   slight rollout to it. So this exercise you can  see is a great way in a closed chain environment   to train your back. But as I get the bar down  to the ground, I simply roll it out to again,   allow myself to get a greater stretch and  quickly roll it back and right up into the   rep. More powerful contraction, more muscle fiber  recruitment, better muscle gains in the long run.   So now when it comes to the chest, maybe you're  thinking, I know Jeff's not going to go to the   chest fly. Well, sort of. I mean I'm not going  to do an unsupported dumbbell bench fly because   I know the vulnerability of the shoulder in that  position and we wouldn't want to play around with   the stretch reflex of that exercise. In fact, we  don't even do the exercise. However, you could do   the standing version here, which is the 3D cable  crossover. We had the opportunity to do just the   traditional way here where we get that stretch and  then explosively come out of it, or we can take   it up that quarter of a way, drop it back down a  little bit more ballistically again, under control   always, come up back up to the top with another  strong contraction. But we don't have to stop   there. We can apply this to a bench press also  and in the form of a dumbbell bench press we have   a couple things we want to make sure that we do  to make this even more effective. The first thing   is utilize what I've covered before as the chest  master tip. Whenever you're training your chest,   you want to make sure that you take your traps and  you depress them. Because when you depress your   traps, not only is it setting your shoulder blades  back and down, but it's taking your shoulders from   a position of dominance from here and it's getting  them out of the way so that the chest can do more   of the work. But I've also given myself a greater  stretch on the chest, touching the outside of your   pecs with those dumbbells and driving at every  repetition more forcefully. Of course you've got   the opportunity to do that extra quarter rep if  you so choose, to get that more ballistic extra   push to make that repetition even that much more  explosive. So you might be wondering, Well, Jeff,   what about a dip? A dip is a great exercise for  the chest that actually does place a good stretch   on the pecs, especially those lower pec fibers.  However, I wouldn't use it as a choice here   because you're already in a vulnerable position at  the bottom of a dip. So going into a bottom of a",

        "text": "dip more aggressively is just taking an already  vulnerable shoulder anterior capsule and placing   more stress on it. So a good exercise that does  place a stretch on the chest, but not for this   particular use. So when it comes to the shoulders,  if you want to create more width and size,   the middle delt is where you should probably  focus your efforts. However, the side lateral   raise, as you can see here, has its limitations,  as far as the stretch reflex recruitment goes,   because you never really get there. You see,  if you want to stretch your middle delt out,   you're going to have to bring your arm across your  body. And the only way to do this is to utilize   either cables or to change the way you do the  exercise and the position of your body when   you do it. And we could do this here with this  inclined side lateral raise. You could see as I   lay myself on the bench in this way, I don't get  stopped by my own leg in the lateral raise. I can   go across my body, further out in front, and get  that stretch that we're looking for. And again,   we can do this in that one and a quarter way,  take it up just a little bit and then drop it   and more forcefully come out of the bottom here.  The choice is up to you, it depends on your level   of experience, but this is the way to do it if  you're looking to take advantage of this and   apply it to your shoulder training. So now when it  comes to the legs, we can apply the stretch reflex   here as well. Think about it, a squat gives us a  great opportunity to do this. However, you might   be thinking, Oh, we're hitting our quads, right?  No, the stretch reflex when applied to a squat, is   actually placing it on the glutes. Because if you  think about what happens at the bottom of a squat   you'd realize there's not enough stretch on the  quads to actually take advantage of the reflex.   You see, if you get to the bottom of a squat,  and you were to simply lay yourself on your side,   you'll see that this is not placing the quads on  any type of significant stretch. Even though your   knee is bent, it's not bent enough, and of course  to get a greater stretch in your quads knowing   that the rectus crosses the hip as well you'd  have to get your leg behind your body. So this   isn't going to cut it there. But we do know that  because we're in deep hip flection at the bottom   of a squat, we're going to have a great stretch  on the glutes. We're going to get a stronger   thrust out of the bottom of the squat, the hardest  place to perform the lift. Now that being said,   that doesn't devalue the pause squat. As a matter  of fact, the pause squat is done for a different   reason. Remember, there's different aspects to  your training. This is not the only thing you   should be pursuing, the stretch reflex. Because  of the bottom of the paused squat you're learning   to take the stretch reflex out of the equation so  you can get more strength and just overall ability   to overcome the inertia of being at the bottom  of the lift so that when you go back and add the   stretch reflex to it, now you get the benefits  of both of them. And finally, here we can hit   the hamstrings with an exercise like the single  leg RDL or we could hit the glutes. You see, how   you do this exercise will actually change whether  or not you're going to shift the focus from the   hamstrings to the glutes. A lot of people would  do this exercise like this. And this might be   good if you're trying to create a stretch on the  hamstrings. You see, because as you lean forward,   you're not getting any real loading of the hip  because you're not allowing yourself to go into   hip flection at all. You're just simply bending  forward at the waist which creates that stretch   on the hamstrings. This is the best way to perform  the exercise if you're looking to get the stretch   reflex on the hamstrings. But if we wanted to  shift the focus to the glutes, if you sit back,   you see you create the hip flection by hinging at  the hips. And when you do hinge, that will load   the glutes up, preferentially recruiting them over  the hamstrings because the focus isn't so much   on keeping a straight knee as it is on maximizing  your hinge. Again, whichever you choose here guys,   the way you do it's going to be the same, and the  idea is recruiting more muscle fibers to the task   at hand by taking advantage of a reflex you're  probably overlooking right now. So there you have   it, guys, 11 exercises primed to help you  get better gains, start to implement them,   and use them yourself to see better gains.
