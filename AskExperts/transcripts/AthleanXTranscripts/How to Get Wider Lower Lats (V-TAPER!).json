        "text": "squeeze on the lat to really get a good contraction now ever there was a lat exercise that did for the lats with the face pull does for the rest of your body this would be it the one-arm high cable rope and the reason for is because the exercise is pretty damn near perfect and that it gives you that excursion of the elbow all the way out in front of your body and also gives you that height differential from a position way up out in front of you to down all the way next to your hip so you can see if we do this right guys you're going to not only get that big long sweep reinforce from it but we're also going to get that differential in the elbow positioning that we don't get from a straight up pulldown above our head that we get from this exercise that pulls us out away from the body so to perform it properly you want your feet placed wide apart here on the floor and you want to drop this hip back because when you get that arm out in front you're creating all that stretch in the lat so as you drive that elbow down it's very easy to keep it really close and tight to your side and literally target that hip point right here with your elbow try to touch the elbow down to the hip with a little bit of that rotation that this exercise provides so it's an unbelievable exercise option for really feeling what it is here I'm talking about [Music] so it's not often that it's worth it to pull an inclined bench over to a pulley machine but this is one of them the incline single arm stretch pulldown gives you a great opportunity to get that full range of motion and get that stretch and more importantly that peak contraction on the lap if you do it right so we want to do is we want to set the bench up here at about a 45 degree angle and then lay on one side with both of the feet in legs or a favour towards that side so that when I let the arm go up over the body",

        "text": "I get that intense stretch on the lats because I have my arm up all the way but more importantly I get the extra rotation because my hips are rotating this way while my upper body and torso sort of rotated back from here though the most important thing is I've got that clear line to drive this elbow right down towards that hip to really feel that intense contraction in the lap and then getting right back up with that stretch again with that clear line again to be able to really drive squeeze and try to touch that elbow right into the hip [Music] unless we're not least exercise number five they send the fastest way to get from point A to point B is a straight line there's no straighter way to get from point A to point B than with the straight arm push down but rather than performing the exercise as the traditional to arm variation here that actually stops the amount of extension in adduction you can get with the arm because that bar tends to hit your thighs we can do what I like to do here and that is to just simply do it one arm at a time and we it get is additional contraction why because when I get squared up here and I get ready to do the push down normally I would again and counter that thigh and get stuck but because I have a free hand here that's not encumbered by the bar I can actually go back and through the body and behind it to get more of that adduction a little more extension to really fire up the lat and more so to get that elbow even further down right towards that hip right behind me I can get a little bit more approximation of those two points which in the end is going to create a lot more of an intense contraction [Music] some thing I have a guy's five exercise that you can use for your lats to get",
