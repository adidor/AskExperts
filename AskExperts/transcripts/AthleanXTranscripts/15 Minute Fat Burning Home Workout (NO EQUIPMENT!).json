        "text": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere. Athleanx.com. And  oh man, do I have a doozy for you today. You see,   that thumbnail of me, that actually was me after  doing exactly what you're going to do here today.   And the only thing that's negotiable, because  you're going to look just like that, is whether   you look like that in say, eight minutes, around  15 minutes, or maybe even around 23 minutes.   Because this is a follow along workout that you're  going to be able to do whether you're a beginner,   intermediate, or advanced that is going to knock  you on your ass. And I'm not ashamed to say that   it did to me. And the fact is, guys, when you're  looking for that good conditioning workout where   you want to break that sweat, where you want to  feel like your heart's pumping through your chest,   this is going to do it every single time. So what  we're doing is we're breaking it down into three   areas. We have our lower body, the upper body, and  then a core segment of this. And basically you're   going to have four exercises per segment. These  are the ones you're going to be doing. I'm just   going to give you a little glimpse here because  you're going to feel the torture of them all as   you do them. When we hit the lower segment here,  we're going to have the split squat lateral hop,   the ratchet squat, the prisoner walk-up, and  something called the side winder. Now the first   three of these exercises are going to be done  either for 15 seconds if you're a beginner,   20 seconds if you're intermediate, or 25 seconds  if you're advanced. And then you get to rest   the remainder of that 30 second time. So if  you're a beginner you're resting 15 seconds,   if you're intermediate you're resting ten seconds,  and if you're advanced you're resting a measly   five seconds before you get into the next  exercise. Okay, so you're going to be moving   through those exercises. The last exercise  in that group and they're the side winder,   that's the burnout, and you've got to  do that for a full 30 seconds. Once you   finish that entire segment there, you take a  30 second rest, and you move on to the next,   which is the upper body. And here, we're doing  these exercises. We've got the hover hop,   the step through push-up, the push-up toe tap,  and then finally the hover pulse. And it looks   so little but it's so damn challenging because  it's in that last spot. Again, for the first   three here, if you're doing it at the beginner  level, 15 seconds a piece, with 15 seconds rest,   20 seconds a piece at ten seconds rest if you're  intermediate, and 25 seconds a piece with five   seconds rest if you're advanced. We all do the  final exercise here for 30 seconds. You get that   30 second rest and you move on one more time  to that last segment, which is for the core.   And here the exercises are the twisting piston,  the black widow knee slides, lateral mountain   climbers-- changing the way we do this, always--  and then finally the V-sit pulse. And once again,   applying the same rules to how we do them. Now,  here's the cool part: if you're a beginner,   your work is done. If you're intermediate, you  got to go through again. And I actually made it   so simple for you because I'm going to put a  timestamp in my pinned comment below that you   can hit that's going to bring it right back to the  beginning and you go through it again. And a few   advanced guys out there, you get to go through  it two more times. So once you're done with it,   you hit that timestamp one more time, you go  through and you finish it one more time. Guys,   this is not easy, like I said, it left me up  against this wall-- proudly against this wall   because I laid it all out there. You're going to  do the same thing here. Let's get this thing done.   So there you have it. An absolute gut-buster  here, guys. Like I said, this one is meant   to bring you to your knees. Don't have shame  about that. Just feel proud that you actually   got through it. And remember, you can always bump  your way up, beginners can move to intermediate,   intermediate can go up to advanced. The fact  is always striving to get better is the key.   If you're looking to get better, guys, I have a  complete program, it's called Athlean Zero. There   are no equipment requirements at all. And as we  did in this workout here, no equipment required,   very little space required. You can get the job  done if you know the right exercises to do. We   have them all step-by-step in that program. You  can get it at Athleanx.com.
