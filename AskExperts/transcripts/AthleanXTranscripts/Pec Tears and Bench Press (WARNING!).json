        "text": "What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com.  Should you fear the bench press? Are you in   danger of being the next one to suffer a pec  tear? Look, I get it, with the videos that   have been going around lately, you have probably  a good reason to be fearful. As a matter of fact,   if you haven't seen this one, this one's  going to strike fear in pretty much anybody.   Look, there there's no doubt that is one of  the most gruesome pec injuries I've ever seen.   But are you next in line to suffer the same fate?  Now, what people have done sort of ad nauseum at   the moment is break that video down and try to  reverse engineer what happened there as reason   for what you could do to correct or prevent that  from happening to you. That's not the way you look   at this, guys. As a PT, I can tell you, you need  to sort of look a little bit more globally at the   biomechanics of the exercise and see where  you might have some shortcomings that could   potentially increase your risks a bit in terms  of your performance of the exercise. So, I want   to make sure that I do this the right way, guys.  I'm going to put the science back in strength and   break the exercise down for you segment by segment  and see where you might be at risk and maybe   where you don't have to be concerned at all.  All right, so the thing we should do is make sure   that we're all talking about the same muscle,  because when we talk about the pecs, there's a   differentiation between the pec major and the pec  minor. And you can see here the pec minor has a   different attachment point than the pec major does  and is the big difference of why we almost never   see pec minor tears on the bench press and why we  almost exclusively see pec major tears. Because   the major attaches to the arm, which is going  to be able to move in space to create a greater   stretch that can reach his breaking point.  So, speaking of that breaking point,   the pec can tear in one of four different places,  either in the muscle belly itself or at something   called the musculotendinous junction, where the  belly feeds into the tendon that then goes on   to attach it to the arm. Or it could be a little  bit more ugly where it's going to detach itself   or avulse from the bone. And that can be either at  the proximal attachment on the sternum or out here   in the humerus. It's actually the humoral avulsion  that we saw in that video that I showed you.    Okay, so now who's most susceptible to this  injury, because that's probably what you're   most concerned about, are you next? Well, there's  two major categories of people that have to worry   even a little bit here. And that is, number  one, you're an athlete. Particularly a rugby or   football player, a boxer or maybe a professional  wrestler. Because there are stresses that can   happen spontaneously in those sports that place  a great eccentric overload on your pecs that can   result in a tear. Ironically, almost all the tears  that occur in these athletes happened in that mid   belly form. The other population of people that  oftentimes will experience those tendon pec tears   or those avulsion type tears is a weightlifter.  And if you're watching this channel, you're   likely lift in some ways. However, within that  category, there's one exercise that stands above   all the others when it comes to creating that pec  tear and that's the bench press. And we're talking   specifically about the barbell bench press. And  when we look at it in relation to the dumbbell   bench press, there's almost a non-existent risk  in the dumbbell bench press versus the barbell   bench press. The disproportionate number of pec  tears that come from a barbell versus a dumbbell   actually for me holds the key difference as to  why we were at increased risk from the exercise.   And that gives you the opportunity to  make some adjustments accordingly.    To understand the key differences between  the variations of that same exercise,   you want to understand what the pec does  in the first place and more importantly,   how we can place it on stretch by going in  opposite of those actions. And the first   thing I want you to do is take your arm out to the  side and place the other hand here on your pec.   Now, I want you to pull your arm down to your  side. That's called adduction, right? And when we   do that, we can feel the pec engage and contract.  We can intensify that even more by not stopping   at our side but allowing it to actually cross  midline. That's called horizontal adduction,   but it's still a form of adduction. The second  main function of the pec is to actually internally   rotate the shoulder. So, if I take my arm and  I dive it down and then take the thumb and try   to point it down towards the ground, you're going  to feel the fibers of the chest engage even more.",

        "text": "The third function is to actually flex the  shoulder more of a job of the upper pecs,   but still the pec major we're talking about  bringing the shoulder up into this direction. So,   if we wanted to see where the chest becomes most  at risk, then we want to see how we place it   on the greatest amount of stretch, and that is  reversing those directions. So instead of going to   adduction, you want to go into abduction, getting  the arm out away from our body instead of internal   rotation, we go external rotation. You can see  that when we get into external rotation here,   you can feel an even greater stretch on the  pecs. The last thing is not shoulder flexion,   but the opposite of that, which is shoulder  extension, bringing the arm back behind the body.   You can see what I get to the bottom of the bench  press, I'm putting myself in that maximum stress   position. Place a high load there, you're  asking potentially for some trouble.    Well, not so fast. You see, because of  the three motions I just talked about,   there's only one that actually can be  altered and is altered between the two   different positions of the bench press, whether  done with the barbell or dumbbell, and therefore   potentially subjecting you to a pec tear.  It's not rotation. Because rotation and   altering rotation on the bench press, no matter  what form you're doing, is non-negotiable. You   can't change the rotation of the shoulder and  still do the same effective exercise. If I do   the bench press and you look at it from the side  in order to be done right, the bar has to ride   over the forearm directly in line with the elbow,  that is where your pressing power comes from. It's   also where your safe shoulder mechanics come from.  Because if I allow the bar to drift backwards   into more external rotation, not only have I taken  the bar away from the desired alignment over the   elbow, but I've placed additional stress on the  front caps on the shoulder. We don't want that.   Equally as bad, we would allow the bar to drift  forward, taking us into more internal rotation.   This is going to lead to a far greater  likelihood that you're going to see an AC   joint injury than ever having to worry about a  pec tear alone, because these biomechanics are   horrible for the shoulder. And again, nothing  you would even consider, so it's a nonfactor   between the difference of the two versus the bench  press. Which leads us to the extension component,   once again, not something we even consider here.  As a matter of fact, on the dumbbell bench press,   you get more extension of the arm  behind the body because you're not   being stopped by the bar on your chest. Add to that fact that most pec tears occur   in this zone right here. And that is the  zone just a couple inches off of the chest   where you were nowhere near full extension  at the shoulder. Again, fewer injuries on the   dumbbell bench press versus the barbell bench  press extension is not the focal point.    Which brings us to abduction, that third  component of chest function that I believe   is the determining factor of whether or not you're  at greater risk of a pec tear when you're doing   the bench press. See, because if I grab a pair of  dumbbells, you can see first and foremost that my   hands are very close together, much more narrow  than we would finish the top of a bench press.   Hold onto that thought for a second because it  matters. When I lower the dumbbells from there,   you can see that the elbows track pretty close  to the side, generally at about a 45-degree angle   or so from the side. And Jesse even verifies that  here with a goniometer measurement at the bottom.   Now, if I grab a barbell immediately, because I  have to take a non-close grip bench press grip,   I'm going to be gripping much wider at the top  than I would on the dumbbells. Like I said,   what that does, guys, is it takes that arm  into greater abduction even from the start.   If I hold my hands right here as if I'm holding  a pair of dumbbells, you can see that grabbing a   barbell takes my arm into greater abduction  away from the body from here to here.   Now, from there, we drop down, even if  you're properly tucking your elbows,   you're going to find in most people, they don't  have the flexibility to get any closer than,   let's say, 60,65, 70 degrees of abduction, which  is a significant increase over the 45 degrees   that you get on the dumbbell bench press.  This alone adds just enough of a difference,   especially for those people that are lacking the  mobility and the flexibility through the pecs in   the shoulder to handle the stresses, especially  under high loads in the heavier loads that you",

        "text": "would experience on the barbell bench press versus  a dumbbell bench press that can lead to that   sudden pec tear they've now become fearful of.  So why are you at such risk here? Well,   a couple of things are happening. Number one, the  activity of the pecs is greatest during the press   in this area. We know that right off of the  chest, the shoulders contribute the most.   Then it sort of shifts a bit more towards the  chest, doing the majority of the work. And then it   sort of finishes off with the triceps, helping you  up through the lockout. If we apply the fact that   we know that eccentric stresses are even greater  than concentric stresses, most pec tears occur on   the way down. And again, in this red zone where  the packs are controlling the most of the work   and the tension through them is highest. Now, if that tension exceeds what the tendons   can handle, they can snap. Add into the  fact that anyone abusing anabolic steroids   has generally weakened tendons and they are much  more likely to give in and be able to be exceeded   by the force that can be generated through the  stronger pecs, especially in this risk area.    So now is the recommendation they have to stop  barbell bench pressing in order to avoid the   pec tear? No, not at all. As a matter of fact,  again, the risk is very, very low for most people,   especially those that are not abusing  anabolic steroids. But I will tell you this,   you should try to adapt your chest to the stresses  that it's going to have to face in a barbell bench   press that are unique to that variation versus  dumbbell bench press. We could actually use   different variations of the exercise to help our  body to accommodate to the stresses is better.   First thing we could do is a pause bench. No,  not the kind done traditionally with the pause   occurring at the level of the chest. I'm saying  done on netcentric when the stresses of the chest   are at their greatest and that area of the dissent  that they're at their greatest and that is two to   three inches above the chest. Now, of course,  you can take this even further by incorporating   the traditional pause to the chest for a  double pause. Take it down on the center,   hold for a second in that hot zone, two to three  inches above the chest, come down to the chest,   hold for a second and then explode back up to the  top. Now, one of my favorite ways to do this is   actually to get out of the bench press entirely  and take it to the floor in a weighted to push   up. And what's unique here is we're actually  taking it from an open chain exercise to a closed   chain exercise. And that has different kinematics  that make the exercise more safe and has better   stability provided to you when you perform it so  you can explore wider hand positions on the floor   to get your body used to the stresses that  they're going to feel in the best press.    The fact is, all of these things can help you to  accommodate to the stresses so you don't have to   forgo the exercise just because you're trying  to avoid a pec tear. All right, guys, I hope   you found the video helpful.
