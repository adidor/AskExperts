        "text": "what it might look like at a given body fat percentage so you can say yeah I kind of look like that right now but they also help you to identify visually where you want to be or where you want to get to and importantly here guys it's important to point out that the answer to the question that we started with was what specific body fat level do I have to get to this is where the encouraging news comes in it's not just one particular body fat because you can see here that the range even on the guys side here to actually have ABS visible even a little bit like the top row of ABS over here is somewhere in the 1617 percent range and it goes all the way down to the most extreme the same thing here for women it's going to have a large range you can be from unhealthy to a much more healthy range but still be able to see your abs but depending upon what body fat level you aspire to it's going to change the level of commitment and dedication you're gonna have to have and probably discomfort and all-out hatred of the path if you choose the wrong one because if you sit all the way over here first of all not only is this unobtainable and healthy for the long term but you need to be so dialed in here and pretty much be just north of dead to be able to sit at this body fat level for any in sustainable period of time so we want to start to veer towards these other healthier ranges the idea though is it becomes a lot more forgiving in terms of your lifestyle you don't have to worry so much about your nutrition in terms of being dead not accurate every single day day after day after day cheat meals become a thing of reality as you start to veer more towards these as your ideal in what you're striving for so the path itself is going to be heavily influenced by what body fat level it is that you're looking to get to now the next thing we're gonna make sure we point out",

        "text": "though is something called the training effect in other words if you're willing to train your abs along your way to your goal there is a difference in the level who are ability to see your abs at higher levels because we can see right here at a roughly nine percent body fat a much leaner individual here there's not a lot of visible ab definition here probably because there's not a lot of ab training going on here on the other hand though this gentleman here too substantially higher body fat probably fifteen or sixteen percent as much better ab development because he is training his abs directly so there's something you want to make sure you're aware of if you have a willingness to just add some direct core training to what you're doing you're gonna have an ability to have those abs pop at even a higher body fat level so the next question becomes then how do you get there right there's three ways you can do it in only three ways one you could just do nutrition alone two you can just try to train or three you can combine nutrition training you guys know me by now you know I'm not gonna [ __ ] you the answer is always gonna be nutrition and training because we know you've probably tried it in the past that just taking a nutrition approach is really just about adopting a diet which is a short term approach that doesn't usually allow you to even keep off whatever it is that you do lose and then you have the guys that want to just train and they show up with the gym and there's no accountability once they leave the gym for the other 23 hours of the day and what they actually put in their body and that doesn't results either so you're gonna have to learn how to combine both of them and here's why because you're already getting the training effect that we already talked about which has a direct impact on the visibility of the ABS but you're also getting the additive effect",
