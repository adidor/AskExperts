        "text": "What s up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, athleanx.com.  Jesse Lacio, athleanx.com.   You could stay down here, I'm a little bit more  comfortable down here with you down here.    Oh, the shorts?  Yeah. So today we're going to talk about   the deadlift and maybe your deadlift doesn't look  this bad, but when you do it, you've recognized   the fact that there's something wrong here, right?  Either it doesn't look the way it's supposed to,   or you're getting stuck at some point in the lift.  So what I've done for you today as I put together   five red flags that are going to define for you  the muscle weakness that is causing the problem   that you're having right now. You see, only two  things cause problems in the deadlift either you   learn the wrong form and simply ingrained that  over time by adding more and more weight to the   bar on a foundation that was weak in the first  place. Or you just don't have the muscle strength   to do the deadlift right. So for that, guys, we  need to start where we always do, and that is    With a Jesse intro. Run it.  No, no, no, no.    In a world where people pick things up and put  them down. There's one man who picks things up   and puts them down better than the  rest and still has an eight pack.    Listen, two things, number one,  you're insufferable. And number two,   I got to give you props, that was  actually a really good lift.    Thank you, I appreciate it. I  owe a lot to your coaching.    Well, thank you. Can we get  back to the video now?    I guess. So, we have to start with guys   the ability to actually hold on to the bar and  that means what is your grip strength like?    A good grip is imperative to having a good  deadlift because if you don't have a good   control of the bar, well, things like that  are going to happen. So we need to fix that.   In order to strengthen our grip there are a  few exercises that I really rely on the most.   The first is the Weighted Pullup and not only  is this a great back strengthening exercise,   but it does require that you have grip strength  to be able to hold on to that bar when you have   additional weight strapped around your waist. But  if you don't have, let's say, the back strength   to perform the exercise but still want to see  the benefits of the extra added grip strength,   you can simply do a Weighted Hang. Here, you're  not having to pull up, but you do have to have   good shoulder stability, which is another benefit  that's going to carry over into the deadlift.   The last exercise you could do is certainly the  Carry, which is one of my favorite exercises for   a lot of different purposes. But you can easily  mix it in to either the strength training portion   of your workout or into the conditioning  aspect of any workout program you're on.    So let's say the grip is good, but now you  struggle because you can't break these plates   off the ground, and to do that, you're going  to want to have strong quads. That's right,   when you do the deadlift, pulling from the ground  really means you need to have strong quads to get   it off the ground to break the bar off the ground.  I talk about it all the time, the deadlift is a   leg exercise to start, at least to the level of  the knee. Think of it as a Standing Leg Press   and to do that, what we need to do is be able to  strengthen those quads. So the best way to do that   is to make sure you're doing the right exercises  and your other parts of your workout.    And for that, we're talking about a Front Squat.  We know the Front Squat gives us that preferential   ability to hit the quads a little bit more so than  the glutes in the traditional squat. We also have   a Bulgarian Split Squat, which does not only a  great job of giving you a chance to target the   quads better, but to do so in a unilateral way  to expose any imbalances that might exist right   or left. And we also have a Reverse Lunge, which  can be done with either dumbbells or a barbell,   as seen here. Being able to maintain that  upright torso shifts that load once again,   just like in the Front Squat to have that  strength to be better able to pull that   bar off the ground. But it doesn't stop there  because in order to break the bar off the ground,   you have to be stable in the first place. And that all comes from up here. And that is   by having strong lats and a strong core. Because  you need to create the tightness through the body,   through the body to be able to perform the  lift efficiently. So the first thing is these",

        "text": "lats over here, can you pin your arms down to  your side? While we have an exercise for that,   the Straight Arm Push Down and the best way to do  this is either as a traditional sternum push down,   we were really trying to get your elbows tight  to your sides and down as far as you can.   Or you can mimic more the requirements of the  deadlift and perform asymmetrically like this,   which becomes more challenging as you  stand up. That bar wants to drift away,   and you have to have that isometric strength in  place. But whatever you do, make sure you're doing   some version of the Straight Arm Push Down. The second thing is the abs the core,   and that also needs to be tight and what  we do. There is some version of a Carry,   preferentially a Unilateral Carry. When you  hold that one heavy dumbbell on your side,   you're challenging your pillar strength and your  torso to be able to maintain an upright posture.   And though you're doing a bilateral balanced  movement here on the deadlift, you still want   to have the ability to keep a rigid, tight  torso throughout the entire lift. If you want,   you can do it overhead variation as well. With the arms up overhead, you're introducing   a bigger challenge because of the momentum arm  increase. Either way, incorporating them is going   to help you to build more of that strength  that's necessary for your core to help and   assist you to maintain the tightness, to get that  bar going off the ground in the first place.   So let's say you can get the bar off the  floor, but then you struggle at that point   when I'm talking about is from here to here  to and through the knee, not lockout out, but   just in that area from here to here. Well, that  brings up red flag number three because again,   we have to look at the weaknesses that are putting  you in this position in the first place. And the   muscles that are responsible for this are going  to be the hamstrings here and more importantly,   the low back. But we have to choose the right  exercises to do this because we don't want to   necessarily train the hamstrings from a  flexed knee position, but more so from   a flexed hip straight knee position. Allowing the  hamstrings to focus on that secondary role of hip   extension. So we're looking at exercises like the  RDL, and not only does it share deadlift in its   name with the deadlift itself, but also shares a  lot of the same muscle responsibilities in terms   of the hamstring activation. We could also take  the deadlift again and perform it with lighter   weights and a deficit deadlift fashion, increasing  the range of motion of the exercise, which is   going to increase the activation of the hamstrings  in their participation in the movement.   And of course, we have to dynamically work the  low back here too, and my choice exercise is the   Weighted Hyperextension. And what this is doing  is allowing you to put a weight across your chest   and allow the hamstrings to operate again out  of this elongated state. We're focused on the   hamstrings as hip extensors because that is what  their role is during the deadlift. And of course,   the deadlift is a compound exercise,  so it's not just to muscle groups,   the hamstrings and lower back contributing in this  part of the lift. We have those stabilizers that   have to be addressed to and for that, once  again, the lats and now the traps from lower   to middle and upper stability is incredibly  important, especially important in this part   of the lift. To and through the knees is going  to demand that you have good thoracic extension,   ability and strength. Think about it. You've  seen people cave in through that thoracic spine   because they're succumbing to the  weight of the bar in this position.   They don't have full glute participation here  yet. That's going to kick in next. So they're   succumbing to that extra weight and load. You  have to strengthen this as much as you can, and   that Strait Arm Push Down will do just that.  But when it comes to the traps, we can work our   way from top to bottom. The heavy shrug is a  great exercise for building up the strength of   your upper traps and for supporting that bar and  the weight of that load as you start to lift it.   The middle traps are going to respond best to  something like a row done at a better position.   In other words, don't allow your thoracic spine  to round at all when you're doing a row. Make   sure that even if you have to use slightly  lighter weights, you're performing them with   really good thoracic strength, meaning either  neutral or slightly extended if possible.    And of course, we can work those lower traps with  something as simple as the Face Pull with the",

        "text": "overhead element added at the end. All of these  are going to provide more stability and rigidity   here so that you don't succumb to the weight of  that bar. Because again, you'll see it even as   people start to approach those really extreme ends  of their one rep max. They just can't offload that   because this area will never be stronger than the  way that bar that you have there. But the better   you can fortify yourself by strengthening it, the  more efficient this lift will become, and you'll   be performing correctly and properly through  that to and through portion of the deadlift.    And that brings us to red flag number four,  the inability to lock out the lift. And it's   the most frustrating part of a deadlift because  you've done all the hard work, you've just got   to get those hips all the way through. And this  is the part that we're talking about from here   to here. We're only talking about a matter of a  couple inches. And again, it seems like all the   hard work is done, but some people will really,  really struggle here. And your problem is glute   weakness and once again, low back contributing to  that final portion of the lift. But what can you   do? Well we've got to make sure that we're working  the glutes this way. If you can choose exercises   that train the glutes in this anterior posterior  motion, you're going to have a better opportunity   to nail this lockout. And the exercise I love  here is the Pull Through, and this is going to   isolate that hinge element of the deadlift,  allowing us to use the glutes as the main driver   through that final stage of hip extension.  And we can maintain those hinge mechanics,   but make the exercise a lot more explosive with  something like The Swing. You're just going to   want to make sure that you use heavy enough weight  here. So you're not making this a conditioning   focus exercise, but one that's going to have  better carry over to the deadlift itself through   the heavier loads. If you want to go really heavy  and really work on getting through that final   portion of hip extension, then the Barbell Hip  Thrust is another great exercise to do. And again,   don't shortchange your range of motion here  just so you can look good on Instagram with   a lot of plates on the end of the bar, you want  to make sure that you're finishing fully through   hip extension to get the best benefits. And we  mentioned the Weighted Hyperextension before   being a good way to recruit the hamstrings into  the deadlift at that lower portion of the lift.   But if we simply allow that to carry up an extra  phase here to knee flexion and most importantly,   full glute extension, the Glute Hand  Raise now becomes an amazing way to   train all these functions and to tie in  all the functions with the low back.    Well, that looks comfortable.  Well, it certainly is.    All right. So let's say that you have everything  in place. You've got a strong grip. You can rip   that bar off the floor. You've got the strength to  not just take that bar to, but through your knees,   and you can lock out that bar like a champion at  the top. But you have red flag number five and   that is bad form. If you want to fix that, guys,  I put together an official deadlift checklist   everything you need to know about how to perform  the exercise right every single time, you're   going to want to watch that video over here.
