        "text": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. You ready to find out today what your fate is? Do you have the potential to have an 8-pack? I'm going to show you, today, a simple test you can do to determine it. I'm either going to make your day, or ruin your day. Hold on for that, though. The test. All you have to do is take your hands – now I get it. I don’t have a lot that I'm pulling on here. If you have a big bunch of stuff here that you can't even get your fingers around, this test may not be applicable to you. I'm going to say 20% body fat and less is where we're going to target when you should start doing this test. So what you do is, you're going to grab on here with your fingers like this. Grab on and hold onto whatever you can grab, right about the level of your belly button. Then when you stand – because you want to stand here – if you're crunched down like this when you're sitting it's not going to be effective. You stand up, now you tighten your abs. You're pulling away your hands that way, and you're tightening with your abs, and you're just pulling them that way. When you do that you should feel the muscle pull away from the skin, and the fat, and everything else. Then with your fingers being able to be pointed inward you should start to strum your fingers – believe me, this is going to work – strum your fingers over the muscle that's underneath there and see if you feel, underneath the belly button, at the level of the belly button, down below, see if you feel a ridge. See if you feel a bump. See if you feel some sort of ridge that runs left to right across your body. If you don't, then you don’t have the potential to have an e8-pack. If you do, then you have the potential to have an 8-pack. So what does this all mean? Well, in all honestly absolutely nothing because the visible abs that you have, whether you have a 4-pack, or a 6-pack, or an 8-pack; it's not really the number that you have there. It's the fact that you have the ability to see what you have there and you have a completely developed core. Meaning, not just the abs, but you have the obliques to frame it out, and you can get a visibly impressive core. So here's what we're going to do: we're going to look at what I have here with a muscle marker, okay? So start from the top down. As I said, you have the first two abs start underneath the chest and there's a line that comes down here. Now me, interestingly, I actually had – my appearance of this changed a little bit after my second hernia. This got a little bit less deep. It got a little more shallow here. But this comes across here, then I have the next row right here. Again, this got a little wide. This is called a diastasis recti, where you get a little bit of a spreading here.",

        "text": "Again, due to herniation. But that's all right. Coming in here, like this, and then the last row comes in down here and you can see that it runs to the level of the belly button, underneath here, and here. Now, if I were to go and apply that test to myself here, and rub my fingers across this area, underneath that last pack here, I could pull this down as much as I want, and I could rub my finger here. There's no more line coming across that area. I don’t have any more ridges. There's no more connective tissue. So what is causing this? What's causing this is that connective band that runs across that's diving the one muscle – the rectus abdominus – into which area is here; it's just not present here. Genetically I don’t have another band here. But guess who does? Jessie, why don’t you come on the other side of the camera? So now, here I am, Jeff, teaching Jessie, trying to get him and he comes out, rips out with this. So the kid's got one, two, three, to the lower belly button, and – oh, no! What's this?! Four, all the way down here. So Jessie gets an 8-pack when he goes out through here. Now, is Jessie some genetic specimen? He's becoming one, but more importantly he actually has this line. You can feel it. I hate to have to do this. I'm just feeling out this a little, but I can feel this ridge. I could literally pluck it like a guitar string, right here. That ridge is what's allowing him to have his abs pop out, develop, and make a visible 8-pack when he continues to get his body fat level down. Now what is the difference? Because his oblique development isn't necessarily completely there yet, it doesn't look like this, right? He's on the way, but as far as a midsection, this will look more defined as a whole than what this would look like. So an obsession on four, verses six, versus eight is ignoring the main point, that there's so much more you can do to develop whatever it is that you do have, and look really, really damn good in the process. So stop obsessing about that. And if you want further uplifting motivation, look at some of these other guys that didn’t necessarily have 8-packs, okay? This guy, right here, you probably recognize. I think his name is Arnold. He actually – maybe he has, arguably, a 5-pack. He had four, and then one that kind of led down underneath the belly button there, but didn't really necessarily connect. He looks pretty damn good. Franco Colombo, his buddy. Again, we're not looking, or talking about 8-packs, or even the guy that was known for being almost aesthetically perfect, Frank Zane.",

        "text": "Again, you're not talking about 8-packs. But the concept is this: they all looked good and you can look good too, if you don’t obsess about the number. Don’t start getting discouraged because I did this test and I couldn't feel that last, little band there. So what? Get your body fat level down and work on what you do have here. Remember I showed you about the genetic test for the biceps? If you can fit two fingers in here, supposedly, you're doomed to have small biceps. Guys, forget all that nonsense. Genetics exist, but they will never place you in a category that says 'you have no potential to look good'. That is completely false. If you develop what you have, believe in what you have, and work hard you're going to be able to look great. Like Jessie. All right, get out of here you little son of a bitch. I can't believe he has an 8-pack and I don’t.
