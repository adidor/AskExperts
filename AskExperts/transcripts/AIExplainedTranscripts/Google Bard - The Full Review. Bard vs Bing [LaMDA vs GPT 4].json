        "text": "next case study involved more detailed searches than could be done on Google and my conclusion from this is don't trust either of them on dates I asked about how many days were there between the opening of the Eiffel Tower and the Statue of Liberty and both got it wrong if you notice when I pointed out the mistake with Bard and said why did you say three years and four months it did apologize and say yes there are seven months between those dates I also found it kind of funny that after each answer it said Google it please Google it and to be honest I don't know if that's them admitting that their model isn't quite as good as the height may have made it seem or if they just want to keep more of the ad Revenue that they get from Google search but finally it's time to give you a win for Bard and that is in joke telling to be honest being even in creative mode when you ask it to tell a joke it really can't do it these jokes are just awful what do you call a chat bot that can write poetry Google bard okay what do you call a chat bot that can't write poetry chatbt laughing face I don't think Bing realizes that the art of a joke is being concise and witty but hard kind of gets this and says things like what do you call a Bing search a lost cause what's the difference between bing and a broken clock a broken clock is right twice a day okay In fairness they still didn't make me laugh but they were getting closer to a funny joke but now back to a loss for Bard which is in Grammar and Writing assistance I gave it a classic GMAT sentence correction question where essentially you have to pick the version that sounds the best that is written in the best way being guess is right almost every time picking B which is Well written whereas Bard as you can see even if you look at the other drafts gets it wrong more times than it gets it right that's pretty worrying for Google if anyone is going to use Bard as a writing assistant maybe",
