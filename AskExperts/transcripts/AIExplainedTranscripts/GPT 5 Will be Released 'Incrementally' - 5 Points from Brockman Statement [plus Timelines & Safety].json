        "text": "yesterday Greg Brockman the president and co-founder of openai announced the company's ideas about releasing the models Beyond gpt4 in the Tweet he made lots of points of which I found five to be particularly telling I will cover all of them of course and bring in the outside evidence that reveals more but let's start with Jeep T5 which may begin life as GPT 4.2 Brockman said it's easy to create a Continuum of incrementally better AIS such as by deploying subsequent checkpoints of a given training run I'm going to explain that in a moment but then he goes on this would be very unlike our historical approach of infrequent major model upgrades so what he's saying is that it's not all going to be released in one go he describes this as a safety opportunity so it's not like we're going to wake up overnight and gbt5 is deployed more like GPT 4.2 then 4.3 Etc but how would they make incrementally better AI eyes and what are subsequent checkpoints of a given training run to be clear he's not describing a different model each time with more and more parameters a checkpoint during a training run of gypsy 5 would be a snapshot of the current value of the parameters of the model a bit like its current understanding of the data and a subsequent checkpoint would be its updated parameters as it processes either more of the data or the same data more times kind of like someone who rewatched a film and has a more nuanced understanding of it first I want to answer those people who are thinking isn't it already trained on all of the data on the internet how can it get smarter now I did cover this in more detail in my first GT5 video but the short answer is this no we're not yet running out of data in that video I talked about how openai may still have an order of magnitude more data to use that's 10 times more data still available and Ilya satskova the chief",

        "text": "scientist of openai put it like this saying the data situation looks good are you running out of reasoning tokens on the internet are there enough of them there are claims that indeed at some point we'll run out of tokens in general to train those models and yeah I think this will happen one day and we'll by the time that happens we need to have other ways of training models without more data but you haven't run out of data yet there's more yeah I would say I would say the data situation is still quite good there's still lots to go what is the most valuable source of data is it Reddit Twitter books what would you trade many other tokens of other varieties for generally speaking you'd like tokens which are speaking about smarter things which are like more interesting when he talked about tokens which are speaking about smarter things you can imagine the kind of data he's talking about proprietary data sets on mathematics science coding they could essentially buy their way to more data and more high quality data but there is another key way that they're going to get way more data and that is from you they can use your prompts your responses your uploaded images and generated images to improve their services this is honestly why I think he said that the data situation looks good now on another page they do admit that you can request to opt out of having your data used to improve their services by filling out a form but not many people are going to do that it does make me wonder what it might know about itself if it's trained on its own conversations but before we get back to brockman's tweet what might those different checkpoints look like in terms of growing intelligence here is a quick example from Sebastian bubeck author of the famous Sparks of age GI paper so this is this is dpt4's unicorn okay okay so you see you see when I I am personally",
