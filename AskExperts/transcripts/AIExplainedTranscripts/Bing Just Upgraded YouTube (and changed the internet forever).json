I believe you do have to have got through the wait list for Bing chat itself but let me know in the comments if you can access this Dev mode of Edge without the waitlist for being I believe it's very much worth it just like Bing chat itself is and one cheeky final comment before I go I heard rumor on the Bing subreddit that the Bing chat could give you time stamps of the transcript to a video and I was about to excitedly talk about those timestamps for example these on my video before I realized that all the timestamps are wrong and it gives the video as being 6 minutes 50 long when it's actually four minutes 30. I tried it on the Marquez Brownlee video too and it also completely flops so this ability isn't quite integrated yet don't believe the hype if this video sparked",
