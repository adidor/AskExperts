        "text": "18 hours ago Sam Altman put out this simple tweet that you can now disable chat history and training in chatty PT and that we will offer charity business in the coming months but dig a little deeper and behind this tweet is a data controversy that could engulf open AI jeopardize GPT 5 and shape the new information economy I will show you how you can benefit from this new feature reveal how you can check if your personal info was likely used in Gypsy 4 training and investigate whether chanti BT could be banned in the EU Brazil California and Beyond but first the announcement openai say that you can now turn off chat history in chat TPT but that is only conversations that were started after chat history is disabled that won't be used to train and improve their models meaning that by default your existing conversations will still be used to train their new models so how does it work and what does this mean what you need to do is click on the three dots at the bottom left of a chat GPT conversation then go to settings and show and here's where it starts to get interesting they have linked together chat history and training it's both or neither they could have given two separate options one to store your chat history so that you can look back over it later and another to opt out of training but instead is one button you either give them your data and keep your chats or you don't give them your data and you don't keep your chats if you opt not to give them your chat history they still monitor the chats for what they call abuse so bear that in mind what if I want to keep my history on but disable model training we are working on a new offering called chat GPT business I'm going to talk about that in a moment but clearly they don't want to make it easy to opt out of giving over your training data now In fairness they do offer an opt-out form but if you go to the form it says cryptically please know that in",
