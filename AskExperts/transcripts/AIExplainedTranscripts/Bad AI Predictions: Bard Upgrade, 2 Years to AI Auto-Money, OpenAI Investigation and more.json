        "text": "people are starting to get used to the Breakneck pace of AI so I wanted to show that developments in just the last few days fly in the face of what was predicted only a couple of years ago starting with the upgrades The Bard then a snapshot of Claude 2. the all-encompassing open AI investigation and inflection ai's predictions of a self-guided million dollar making AI coming in just two years but I'm going to start with this page from a book released in 2021 called a brief history of AI look at the tasks it says are nowhere near solved and at the bottom it says at present we have no idea about how to get computers to do the tasks at the bottom of the list I'm not arguing that these are solved but this year we are getting pretty close check out the second one down human level automated translation I asked the new bar to write a poem about machine translation and here it is I'm not going to judge the poem but then I asked now translate it into Spanish of course that's nothing new but listen to the quality of the text-to-speech model used to read out this poem here's a snippet is I don't know about you but that is starting to sound awfully human-like now yes it could do this before for English but now it can do it for even Swahili and I know some people will say don't we already have Google translate but Palm 2 which is the model behind Bard outperforms Google translate I covered this in the original palm 2 video but the conclusion was we observe that Palm 2 improves quality both over the original palm and Google translate okay that is pretty insane but what about the next one interpreting what is going on in a photograph are we nowhere near solving that well I gave Bart the meme that you can see and I said interpret what's going on and it said this the image shows a pizza that has been shaped to look like the death star already that",

        "text": "is so Savvy to me that it knows it's a pizza despite it being so strangely formed and it can interpret that the toppings make it look like the Death Star of course as a bonus it can read the text and therefore understand the meme it says it's humorous because the Death Star is a symbol of death and destruction compared to a pizza which is about food and enjoyment a quick bonus tip by the way is that you can scroll to the end of the response and click this modify response button and then you can adjust the output for example I'm going to make it do something shorter and you are going to see a shorter version of this interpretation and here it is apparently reduced by about 25 now the Google lens is incorporated into Bard I use it daily on my walks to answer questions about things around me like maybe I see a butterfly and I ask what type of butterfly is or a plant and one thing to caution you on is that if it sees a human face it will block that out and not answer the question and one more crazy thing that I found that I'm curious if anyone else found this is that I took a photo in my local park in air actually recognized the location of the park and it was not a nationally let alone internationally recognized park at all now that didn't work every time but it is something you might want to try on your next walk or run and you might have noticed that that's quite similar to the one second from last which is interpreting a work of art now again I'm not saying that solved and there may be some reverse image search going on here I asked write a haiku about where the stairs are going in this work of art famously this sketch is about the stairs going nowhere by Esha and it wrote an almost perfect haiku about the fact that the stairs are going nowhere let's now take a break from that book and look at what professional forecasters predicted that AI would be capable of for the math data sets for this particular Benchmark",

        "text": "way the entire world economy will be transformed rapidly there is a curious possibility though that such an AI wouldn't be released to the general public of course I was following the FTC investigation into openai as you might expect I read all 20 pages of the investigation multiple times in fact Sam Altman openly grumbled that the FDC request started with this leak enabling me to read about it it is actually a crazy document and it feels to me a bit like some sort of strip search like they want all internal Communications about the propensity of chatgpt to produce inaccurate statements or reveal personal information and they say at the top do not delete any emails relating to this in other videos I've covered how any model can be jailbroken and I've also covered how Sam Altman said that it might be two years before models stop hallucinating so if the FTC ends up finding open AI or the other companies billions of dollars as they find other companies before I can see one result being much more reticence from these companies over publicly deploying their models of course let me know in the comments whether you think that's a good thing or a bad thing speaking of money though I can't leave out that this week was the start of xai Elon Musk was able to promise up to 200 million dollars as a signing bonus for some of the AI researchers that joined him if companies are willing to promise that much to researchers willing to defect from deepmind or open AI I do find it hard to see the march to Super intelligence slowing down much so let's end with that famous scene from iRobot although perhaps this time with a different ending an imitation of life can a robot write a symphony can a robot turn a canvas into a beautiful masterpiece thank you so much for watching and have a wonderful day",
