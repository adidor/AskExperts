        "text": "gotta be honest with you i don't remember if we put him on allopurinol first and he had a reaction to it or what the reason was but nevertheless we put him on ulrich and that fixed uric acid he was now in the mid-fours and he had to come off his blood pressure medication and his blood pressure normalized so we took the uric acid from six point call it one down to say 4.1 and he no longer needed the ace inhibitor and without any other change this is not a guy who gained weight lost weight made any other meaningful change even in his exercise but his blood pressure now is sort of 120 over 80. and that's i think to set expectations a pretty unusual response to just lowering uric acid but it's also a great teaching point that says don't go after blood pressure until you've fixed uric acid get that uric acid below five and then start playing with the blood pressure medication if you need it but i mean the broader point is try to fix the insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome first which in this case he didn't have but he did have the elevated uric acid before you go after the knee-jerk and easy reaction which is here's a drug to treat blood pressure thank you for listening to today's sneak peek ama episode of the drive if you're interested in hearing the complete version of this ama you'll want to become a member we created a membership program to bring you more in-depth exclusive content without relying on paid ads membership benefits are many and beyond the complete episodes of the ama each month they include the following ridiculously comprehensive podcast show",
