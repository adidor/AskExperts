        "text": "be some set of biomarkers that would suggest an improvement in their lifespan um what do you think about that idea matt yeah so i'm going to agree completely with you that that from a pragmatic perspective and a usefulness perspective that's exactly what we want and i think that's what you know the field has been searching for for a long time it's a complicated um it's a complicated question that you're asking though because you know i think it's it's one thing to uh hypothesize that there are going to be molecular biomarkers that reflect aging right biological age those are not necessarily going to be the same biomarkers that reflect rate of aging and what you're talking about a short term readout almost has to reflect rate of aging or even you know potentially this is speculative reversal of biological aging and so my only point is those may not actually be the same markers for each of those classes so i certainly believe that there will be signatures of um intervention response that are predictive of efficacy i'm not sure that it's going to be the same as the signatures of biological age um and this is actually it's an it's actually a really interesting area because you know i think uh if you had asked me 15 or 20 years ago when i was really getting started in this field you know um the the kinds of interventions you mentioned caloric restriction that's kind of the gold standard that we've been studying for many many years are those slowing aging or reversing aging i would have answered their slowing aging right they are you know decreasing the rate of decline or damage accumulation um what's been really interesting and i think exciting over the last uh 10 years or so is the",

        "text": "observation that at least some of these interventions reverse many of the molecular changes that go along with aging and in many cases the functional changes that go along with aging so you talked about blood biomarkers i agree with you that's a great that would be great if we had blood biomarkers i'm actually a big fan of functional biomarkers so looking at organ function tissue function that's harder to do in people than it is in laboratory animals in some ways but but i really feel like you know those are telling us something fundamental about about future health outcomes um that that you can almost take to the bank right it's there's still some stochasticity involved there's still some luck with staying alive but if you can if you can make somebody's heart function better their brain function better you got to feel pretty good about that that you're and if you can make multiple organs and tissues function better with the same intervention i think you can make a case that you are in fact modulating some underlying biology of aging as opposed to to only the biology of that tissue and organ yeah and frankly matt that's i mean that's exactly what we do in clinical practice the reality of it is and we'll talk about these things but you know i'm not looking at epigenetic clocks right i'm just not um how do i know if we're moving or how do i believe i guess you'll never really know if you're going to talk about this with some humility but what gives me great confidence that we're moving in the right direction with a patient it's basically when all of those functional things improve so if vo2 max improves muscle mass improves strength improves cardiovascular efficiency improves phenotypic markers of disease improve right so glucose disposal insulin",
