        "text": "was because mtor plays such a big role in muscle synthesis that if you inhibit mtor with rapamycin or caloric restriction which is a potent inhibitor of mtor that you would actually see accelerated sarcopenia and that just isn't the observation in laboratory animals again we have to be careful not to extrapolate to people but but it doesn't seem to be the case that you lose muscle uh muscle mass and function and the way that people would Define sarcopenia I think the important complication here is that all of the caloric restriction studies that I'm aware of when they look at muscle function normalized yeah and the calorically restricted mice weigh substantially less than the ad libidum fed mice usually I think it's on the order of 30 35 yes so yeah so it's usually grip strength normalized to weight right so what you're actually seeing is that the calorically restricted mice have maintained muscle function proportionate to their body weight and and I don't know the answer to this but it's something that I thought of when we were talking about this show um you know is let's just say you did that in a person right so you've got you would you would be able to answer this I'm sure you've got a 60 year old person you know who needs to lose 30 percent of their body weight but of course you want to maintain their muscle mass right their muscle function would it would you view it as a good thing or a bad thing if they lost 30 percent of their body weight and 30 percent of their thirty percent of their strength no we I don't think we would and I don't think we would view it as a good thing if that if that because again if you're telling me that someone needs to lose 30 of their body weight presumably their body composition isn't great to begin with so no I think you would you would view that as maybe a better thing than where they",
