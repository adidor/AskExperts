        "text": "idea that says look we basically exist in three different phases of medicine um one of which we're I think not quite into yet but we're in the transition so these transitions are far from discrete and they take in some cases I think the transition from medicine 1.0 to 2.0 took I don't know I would argue from the beginning to the end uh 300 years okay so what are they so medicine 1.0 is when we had no idea of science uh we've kind of keep in mind science is um what you know it's such a political term at the moment that that's really unfortunate but science is a way of thinking right science is not a person science is not an answer science is a process it's a way that we look at the natural world around us we formulate hypotheses about what explains them based on the physical principles of the universe we design experiments to test those hypotheses and we measure the results of those experiments against the predictions of the hypotheses and then we iterate and correct and this was really so so it's important understand like that we're not naturally wired to do that one so Evolution didn't prepare us to do that it had no interest in us doing that I've written at length about this I think I wrote a blog post on this seven or eight years ago called why we're not wired to think scientifically I think we should link to that because I go into much more detail about the time scale of evolution and the process of our thinking so prior to the invention of this idea nothing that existed in medicine could be Tethered to science so anytime something happened you had to come up with an explanation that's why we you know have these",
