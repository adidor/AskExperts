Watkins was elected a fellow of the American Academy of microbiology and was vice chair of research in pathology at the University of Miami prior to this recent transition his early work focused on the similarities between the nonhuman primate simian immunodeficiency virus SIV and HIV in fact SIV is a great animal model for HIV which is where David has spent the bulk of his career and we touch on that quite a bit in this episode because there's a lot you can learn about what may or may not work with corona virus obviously the purpose of this discussion was really to talk about corona virus but really what I find great about this episode is the immunology 101 discussion that I wanted to open with and we did open with but we went deeper than I expected we would go I just can't say enough about that I",
