        "text": "and to this day hypothalamic obesity is a thing that we have to deal with with people with tumors or other damage to the hypothalamus it often causes extreme obesity and what's the nature of the obesity how much of it is due to hyperphagia excess eating how much of it is due to loss of activity or even just a shutdown of metabolic rate yeah that's a great question so if you look at probably the closest experimental analog of hypothalamic obesity that sort of human-like hypothalamic obesity would be vmh lesion so this is something that's been done since i think the 20s they go in with a very precise instrument called the stereotaxic instrument in animals and they lesion this part of the hypothalamus called the ventromedial hypothalamus so basically they're they're replicating they're trying to replicate the damage of hypothalamic obesity and as soon as the anesthesia wears off these animals are cramming food into their faces and if there's no food in their cage they'll eat bedding they'll eat the bedding they will just like put anything they can get a hold of into their bodies and they will continue binging until they have rapidly gained a large amount of weight and then it will start to plateau off but they have extreme hyperphagia and if you restrict their calorie the first experiments that were done on this showed that if you restrict them to a normal level of calorie intake so that of a non-lesioned animal it prevents the fat gains suggesting that the or i should rephrase that it",
