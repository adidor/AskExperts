        "text": "have to go which is is it the enabler or is it the primary cause i mean my argument is that um you know ultimately uh you know as you said these are very complicated you know there's there's many different factors that play out but but my ultimate argument is that the obesity is not causal that it's actually the hyperinsulinemia that is simultaneously driving the obesity and the cancer cell proliferation uh so i think part of the evidence for that is that um you know there are people who are quote-unquote metabolically healthy obese that um you know they store more nutrients in their their subcutaneous fat and more energy and their subcutaneous fat and not the visceral fat and they tend to be metabolic metabolically healthy and do not have insulin resistance and they seem to be no more likely to get cancer whereas when you look at the insulin resistance and people who are thinner but clearly you know i think it's most people actually do have insulin resistance and when you see that metabolic disruption of people who aren't obese they that also tends to correlate with cancer so i think you can to some extent dissociate the obesity uh but then you still have to you know the insulin cancer correlation isn't as strong as smoking either so you know you still have a lot to work with and then you know there's the question that you brought up is i i think this is what you're referring to is the insulin actually you know the first prime step in the process the hyperinsulinemia or is it you know a mutation that occurs",

        "text": "for some other reason and allows the cancer cell to to take advantage of that hyperinsulinemia so yeah is the model basically that if you take um you know a two by two matrix where you have um chromosomal insult yes or no hyperinsulinemia yes no so which one gets cancer is it only the double positive right i mean we would agree that the double negative almost assuredly does not but we would probably agree that the double positive does the question is what's happening in the other corners right what's happening in the individual who has the chromosomal insult in the absence of hyperinsulinemia and what's happening to the person without the chromosomal insult who is hyperinsulinemic to me those are the questions that matter a lot and they matter a lot for the sake of prevention now the the the the obviously um and this is the approach that i take clinically right which is um let's be overly aggressive and assume that both of those are sufficient then you would say well you have to put yourself in the double negative box which is avoid hyperinsulinemia and any sign of metabolic ill health and do every single thing imaginable to reduce the burden of dna insult and you try to narrow yourself and confine yourself into this very narrow box and then you layer on a whole bunch of other things like really aggressive screening and all this other stuff um but but so that's kind of what you would do if you don't have a choice if you're absent perfect information you have to probably act more aggressively but i still think this question of which of the two",
