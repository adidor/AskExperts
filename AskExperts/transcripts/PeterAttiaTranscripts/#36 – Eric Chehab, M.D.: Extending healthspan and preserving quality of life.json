Taylor I remember like it was yesterday in his office for some of the knee injuries I had as a kid so I was exposed to medicine probably more frequently than most people and so I had a pretty good idea but I took a little bit of a circuitous route after college where I taught chemistry and physics in high school but I did it overseas I spending your Milan that's where I saw the great concerts and started an American School there which was a terrific experience and then came back the state's 4-year to a private school in DC called st. Albans an all-boys school there it's very prominent great preparatory school and then went back overseas to Bulgaria about places and tottered an American school there so these three years that you're teaching yes kids in high school did you still think you were gonna go and do medicine or was this a part of deciding if you still wanted to do that no I was pretty sure I was gonna go but as interesting the teaching was fun but I felt like there was more than I could offer I guess and I was basically a high",
