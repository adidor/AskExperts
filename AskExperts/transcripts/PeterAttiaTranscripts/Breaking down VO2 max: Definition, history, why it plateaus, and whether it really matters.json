        "text": "norwegian cross-country skiers is the professional runners and cyclists and things like that but people are usually used to hearing these numbers reported not in liters per minute but in milliliters per minute per kilogram so give an example so people understand those differences because we usually talk about the outliers is a as a number that's a a bigger number than two liters or five liters it would be you know sort of 75 80 milliliters per just explain people how how those are different sure so i i'll use my own numbers when i you know typically when i was tested i could get about a little bit more than five liters per minute so 5.1 5.2 if i remember correctly um now if you compared me to a rower the road would make me look pathetic because the rower would be using seven liters a minute or or more um but the rower is also huge uh you know twice my size or whatever and and and so that doesn't necessarily mean that that rower is better at using oxygen for me because the roller has way more muscle and so the rower is is is the amount of oxygen reaching any given muscle cell may be lower so if you want to compare apples to apples between athletes of different sizes you divide at least for a crude approximation you just divide by weight and so the numbers we usually hear are rather than liters of oxygen per minute it's milliliters of oxygen per minute per kilogram of body weight so for me five liters of oxygen per per minute works out to something like 80 milliliters of oxygen per minute per kilogram of body weight",
