        "text": "and you want to go to bed at a low level and what should be happening is in about the first two hours you should have a huge surge in cortisol so for the listeners only peters actually as luck would have it there's an easel behind us as we're having this conversation and so you want to have this uptick gradual down nice and low at night and just as you're waking up it should be just about to kick off so that's the second factor so you want adenosine to be high you want cortisol to be low and then the third thing you want is you want melatonin to rise and melatonin is secreted by this tiny tiny little gland called the pineal gland and it is secreted in the absence of light it's specifically blue light and it's basically a signal to tell the brain that it's dark so it's melatonin basically removes the brakes of staying awake and that's where the glasses fit in so if you're really trying to optimize your sleep you want high adenosine you can accomplish that by not having caffeine and by being active you want low cortisol that's probably a lengthier topic in itself and then you want high levels or rising levels of melatonin",
