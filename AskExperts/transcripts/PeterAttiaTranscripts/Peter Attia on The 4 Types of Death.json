        "text": "it i talk about four types of death the first one being the one that people think of cardio respiratory pulmonary death like the the what i call death certificate death but then i talk about these three other deaths cognitive death so the really the the death of the ability of the brain the decline of the ability of the brain with respect to you know processing speed short-term memory long-term memory executive function the the physical or exoskeleton death or demise which is basically that which leaves a person in pain and unable to carry out these activities of daily living and then this emotional death and these three types of other death types two three and four often precede one in in some ways the perfect life would be a long life that just goes straight to type one death without detouring through type two type three and type 4 but tragically that's almost never the case and so we think so much about how to identify and treat type 2 type 3 and type 4 but by far the one in which we are the most limited is this identification of type four and part of it is i think shame there's no question right part of it is inadequacy of tools so for example when it comes to identifying type two or type three let's use the physical one we have so many ways that we assess people for movement and strength and balance and stability and stamina and all of these things and usually once people are confronted with how bad they are because almost always relative to our standards for where we want people to be most people fall woefully short but they can see oh this is where i should be if i subscribe to your you",
