[Music] all right Peter welcome to another AMA how you doing I'm doing very well so Peter for today's AMA we're really focusing on One Core topic that we get asked about a lot which is everything around cold therapy and so for people who listen to podcasts follow you on social media we've spent some time recently talking about the benefits of sauna and heat and way back in the day I think it was on AMA 16 you and Bob talked about hot and cold and we've kind of updated your thoughts on hot therapy but we haven't touched on cold and so what we did is we just compiled All Those Questions around cold exposure cold therapy and if that has potential similar benefits to sauna and so we'll hopefully cover them all today including really what we know and don't know about cold therapy how it can affect mood or be a treatment for depression what we know about the claims that it helps activation of brown adipose tissue for metabolic Health any potential cons around cold therapy are there possible geoprotective benefits exercising in the cold and ultimately do we know anything around a consensus for an effective cold therapy protocol so if all goes according to plan that's what we'll cover today anything you want to add before we start jumping into that only that I am exceptionally happy that the F1 season as of our recording is finally back it's a very difficult time for me when F1 is not happening so anyway leave it at that for those listening at the time of this recording it's Friday before F1 starts on Sunday so practice we've just finished fp1 and fp2 for the first race so how many episodes of drive to survive have you watched I'm trying to nurse it along I've only watched five of ten so far",
