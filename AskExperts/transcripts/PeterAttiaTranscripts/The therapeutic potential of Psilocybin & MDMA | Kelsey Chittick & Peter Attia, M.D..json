        "text": "always had a huge blockade in front of it yeah and and i mean i think i think those are two good examples of how those molecules work and i mean i think mdma really has this ability to you know so create this empathy that is very difficult for most people to access um on command uh or or frankly not under the influence of that medication and that's to me if you if you can craft the intention around that it's um you know it can really do an amazing thing for a relationship as well with yourself but also with somebody else especially if there has been something that's gone really wrong sure yeah i mean it's probably been there's been a ton of gifts of grief and i talk about them all the time but i think that that those experiences have been and everyone hates me for it because once i get excited about something i get really excited so i came out of the i come just blazing hot on uh plant journeys and now i kind of understand that you have to be ready and have to want it and have to be ready to be open to it but i am and the other thing i i do think that um at least in my limited experience um i think that the best of both worlds is when you combine that work with the traditional work of therapy and i do think that if there's one thing about the the new appreciation people have of psychedelics that i think is dangerous it's that people believe that the plant or the molecule by itself can do all the work like all i have to do is do psilocybin once a month or once a quarter and and it's all good and it's like",

        "text": "no those are incredible lubricants to allow you to do very difficult things when you're long off the influence of those medications so i i also think like again it's impossible to say what fraction of your recovery has been predicated on that experience versus all that came before it and after and around it um so that's kind of the one thing that i i tend to remind that's smart because yeah i've done a ton of work i've read a bunch and i think the other big thing that i do that has supported all of that is just i have i'm militant about meditation militant and were you before i had started on the path but maybe 20 minutes a day here and there maybe insight timer um once nate died it became a must and to this day and i i saw you guys just got the sauna bag but i will sit in with dispense i think dispenser probably dispenses work has probably changed my life the most in terms of a daily practice they're changing a thought or watching a thought or um knowing that my feelings are transient and that i can change a feeling through it changing a thought or i can say change or i can say stop and it doesn't mean they're not going to come but i do have some agency in how i feel and what i feel which i never believed before um so i think if you if you like you said if you do the psychedelics in conjunction with a very deep meditation and you know a committed spiritual practice that gives you peace whatever that might be you you have a great shot at coming out of pretty much everything yeah it's i've always found it",
