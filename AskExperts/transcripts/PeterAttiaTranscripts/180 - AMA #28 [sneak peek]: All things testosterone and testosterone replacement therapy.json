        "text": "steps um i i'll be honest with you i don't actually remember anymore how many steps it takes to create testosterone out of cholesterol um but what's really important is that it exerts its effect through uh binding to an androgen receptor so um because it is a hydrophobic molecule it basically makes its way into the cell easily it diffuses into the cell quite simply meaning it doesn't require a channel or a receptor on the cell membrane to make its way inside now we'll talk in a moment about how it's transported in the blood but um actually let's talk about that now so as we've talked about a lot with respect to lipids and lipoproteins you know cholesterol can't make its way through the bloodstream the way glucose can or the way electrolytes can you know for example sodium potassium and those things because they're soluble in water they're therefore soluble in in the bloodstream in plasma and they don't need chaperone or carrier proteins but cholesterol does and that's of course why it travels in things called lipoproteins and similarly testosterone needs to be bound primarily to carrier proteins and there are really two dominant carrier proteins that bind testosterone and carry it around one is called sex hormone binding globulin or shbg for short and the other is albumin and directionally speaking shbg is responsible for about two-thirds of the carrying capacity whereas albumin is about one-third but what's important is knowing that it's only the unbound portion of testosterone that is able to",
