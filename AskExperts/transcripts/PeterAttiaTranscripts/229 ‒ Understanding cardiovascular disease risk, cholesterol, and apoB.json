        "text": "words if the reason we begin therapy is because somebody has a positive calcium score which again we covered this in great detail so for people listening we have a dedicated ascvd AMA which goes into heavy detail for about 90 minutes on all this stuff where if this is of Interest that's a great AMA that goes super deep on basically all of the reasons why I think my point of view now is treat early and treat aggressively and I will now also make a very bold statement again it's let's start with the thought experiment right if the thoughts experiment for colon cancer was do a colonoscopy every day on a person's life starting at the age of 30. would you eliminate colon cancer deaths I think the answer is yes and similarly I would say pharmacologically lower apob to somewhere in the 20 to 30 milligram per deciliter range for everybody in the population while someone is in their 20s can you eliminate ascvd and I think the answer is probably yes in other words I think what you're basically going to do is eliminate death from atherosclerotic causes and that would need to be started in 20s I think so yeah very early on yeah so again how do you take that thought experiment and turn it into a practical implication because I don't think it's practical to take every 20 year old and obliterate their APO B although it's clearly something we do in the subset of patients who have significant genetic abnormalities such as the cluster of genetic abnormalities that coalesce around a condition called familial hypercholesterolemia we certainly do medicate those patients usually as teenagers so this is not some completely crazy idea but I think practically what it means is basically by the time you're in your late 30s or early 40s if you have any measure of apob that's even north of the 20th percentile that should be completely lowered so in some ways I",
