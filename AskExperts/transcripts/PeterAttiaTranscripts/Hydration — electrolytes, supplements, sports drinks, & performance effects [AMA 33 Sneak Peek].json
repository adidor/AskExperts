        "text": "one of those places is pretty obvious which is the vasculature so when you know you take blood out of the vascular system obviously water is a non-trivial component of that and it turns out it's about 25 of the extracellular fluid is the plasma that makes up the blood right so blood is made up of cellular contents clotting factors things like that and then of course plasma and you'll notice this anytime you spin blood or see blood spun you know you see if a tube it's red you spin it and all of a sudden it gets very dark at the bottom that's like all the cellular contents predominantly what you're seeing is of course the platelets in the red blood cells which dominate everything else and then you see a sort of clearish yellow fraction depending on um you know how much lipids are in there and that's the that's the plasma which is effectively the water so 25 of the extracellular fluid resides in that space about two-thirds to 60 percent of the extracellular fluid resides in what's called the interstitial space so this is the space that is between cells but not in plasma this is very complicated this is a space that is under appreciated so when you have a cold or you're really really sick some people notice they actually might gain weight um and then they might notice that in the if they're really paying attention in the days after they're starting to get better not only are they losing weight again but they're peeing like crazy and that's because of the expansion of that interstitial space so when we're sick our blood vessels become very leaky and",

        "text": "the reason for that is important that's where we have all the white blood cells and immune cells do something called extravazate from the vascular system so that they can go and reach the tissues but that leaking is what leads to this swelling so if you see a most a more extreme example this is somebody in the icu who's very sick they almost always look like a puffed up michelin man and that's the reason why so the remaining part of the extracellular fluid basically resides in the digestive tract the csf or you know other small fluid uh filled areas within you know epithelial line spaces so the way you can sort of put a bow on this is about 67 of your total body water is inside cells about 20 percent is in the interstitium this area that exists between everything and of course that can really expand when you're sick about eight percent is in the vascular system and about five percent or thereabouts is basically everything else including csf and things like that and do those percentages the overall percent of kind of uh water and someone's weight as well as the breakdown of percent does that change based on body types like if someone's lean if someone has more muscle if someone has more fat and maybe even a follow-up is like does that even matter right does it if you're 60 compared to 65 it's probably what your baseline is as opposed to where you are compared to someone else yeah no but it does change sure for sure so you know muscle is far higher water content than fat so fat tissue is about 10 water by weight we refer to that as",
