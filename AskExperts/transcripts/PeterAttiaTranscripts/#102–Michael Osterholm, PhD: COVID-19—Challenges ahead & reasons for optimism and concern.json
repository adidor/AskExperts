Michael osterholm you may have seen Michael on the Joe Rogan podcast a few weeks ago I saw him then and was immediately impressed reached out to him and asked if he'd like to come on our show which he graciously agreed to Michael is the director of the Center for infectious disease research and policy at the University of Minnesota he's also the author of a book that in many ways foreshadowed this book is called deadliest enemy our war against deadly germs and in that book in particular he foreshadows a lot of what we're going through today Mike and I in this discussion talk about everything from our best understanding of what's happening in the United States with respect to the spread and the slowing of the virus what he's optimistic about what he's pessimistic about what he thinks the end state looks like and what you'd have to believe is true if that is to be altered we also get into the weeds a little bit on some technical things around supply chain limitations with respect to drugs with respect to masks",

Michael Oscar on [Music] Mike thank you so much for making time to sit down with us for some time today and again I want to thank you because I just know that you are constantly being bombarded by requests and there's sort of a challenge you have to deal with which is on the one hand you want to be able to do your job but on the other hand it's somewhat important for people like you doing your job to be able to communicate with the rest of us what you're seeing and more importantly what the implications are and what can be done about it well thank you very much Peter it's very good to be with you and I think that it's venues like yours that serve a very important role in getting information out today far too much of what we deal with is in sound bites it's in three-minute segments and I think that's really hard to convey the complexities and the overall short term long term view of what's happening here so I'm really pleased to be with you thank you well yeah you're in the right spot we're not fans of sound bites here so we'll get right to it and we'll get deep so let's start with kind of the 30,000 foot view which is when we sit here today recording this on March 30th it feels like an eternity ago that you were on Joe Rogan's podcast doing what I thought was just an excellent job of giving Joe and Joe's audience an overview of what we knew at the time what we didn't know at the time what the concerns were what do you feel more optimistic about relative to that time which has probably been three weeks what do you feel less",
