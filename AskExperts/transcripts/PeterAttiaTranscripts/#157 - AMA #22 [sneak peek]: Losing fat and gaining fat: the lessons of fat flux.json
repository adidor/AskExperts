        "text": "losing weight means losing fat and now let's break that down one step further how do you lose fat so broadly speaking there would be two approaches to this one would be to reduce the total number of fat cells another way would be to shrink the fat cells now the former is most typically something that is done with liposuction so that's really the way we lose fat cells is you cut a whole bunch of them out by the way there were some interesting studies that were done a little over a decade ago one published in the new england journal of medicine that demonstrated that there was a totally different metabolic effect of those two approaches so i i don't remember the details of it but basically one group lost a significant amount of total body fat having the fat cut out the other group lost it by you know a dietary intervention that took the same amount of fat off so at the end they both had the same body composition directionally but one had done it through reducing the number of fat cells one had done it by shrinking the fat cells can you guess if there was a difference between them bob i think there might be although i i'm tipped off because i think it was a new new england journal of medicine papers yeah sam klein was one of the authors that's right and yeah there's a profound difference so we should never confuse the metabolic benefits that come from reducing the size of adipose tissue with reducing the amount of it the former uh in the case of liposuction is really a cosmetic procedure whereas uh the latter of course is is has cosmetic benefits but much more",

        "text": "importantly is a metabolic improvement okay so if you accept everything i just said then we can simplify this problem into how do you shrink a fat cell is that fair i think so all right so now let's understand the fat cell and again let's go back to how an engineer would think about this an engineer would think about this by drawing a boundary around this and looking at the boundary conditions and effectively understanding what goes in and what comes out mass cannot be created from nothing and mass cannot disintegrate into nothing so if a fat cell gets larger there is a net accumulation of fat in that cell relative to how much goes out of it and the converse is true so again silly example but if you have a room and the room has a hundred people in it and there were people traveling in and out of the room constantly if you want to understand if that room is increasing or decreasing in the number of people in it you need to understand at every point for which there's an entry or exit what is happening and by doing that you can understand what is the net increase or decrease and i like to refer to that as flux and i won't get into why that's not a technical that technically that's not a perfect definition of flux but it's sort of the way my brain works is to sort of borrow that term from physics and basically say look we're going to talk about this through the lens of fat flux what is the flux of fatty acid substrate into and out of a fat cell and can we infer the behavior of that fat cell",

        "text": "in response to that so i guess before i go on bob i just want to make sure does that does that seem like you know anything you want to add to that or does that seem like a reasonable way to go after this i think that makes sense um a couple of things so you alluded to it that when we talk about weight loss or weight gain or fat loss or fat gain a lot of times we'll hear about calories and calories out right the amount of basically if more energy is entering the system than leaving it the system is getting bigger and vice versa if more energy is leaving the system than entering it it's more or less getting smaller and what you're talking about is at the level of the adipose tissue so we're talking about how much fat is going into the adipose tissue and how much is being released and also how much is being trapped we'll get to i think that's important and the second thing too is i'm glad that you used the word flux because you have an amazing i don't think i don't know if you mentioned it but even amazing blog post on on this topic which is the lessons of fat flux and when we move the we move the uh your blog post over to you know peter atiyahmd.com and i was i was privileged to adding the the header images to the blog posts and in this case i took the liberty of since you used the word flux i have a picture of the flux capacitor and the delorean which i'm sure you you know that it's what makes time travel possible it's also that's we could cover that in another episode it's also an important important concept but those are a couple",
