        "text": "right and i think that that led him to start kind of experimenting with different i different ways to try and restrict blood flow um you know in his lower body upper body etc i think that there's been some stories that his initial kind of ideas he actually harmed himself a little bit because he was maybe applying it too tightly but i think then he actually had a skiing accident and then applied it to himself and actually re have to himself with blood flow restriction and saw some what he thought was some pretty good kind of gains and i think that he really did probably develop a lot of the methods for at least the initial way we were doing blood flow restriction and kind of made it you know very popular and with uh studying and research and things of that nature but yeah i think he's probably the the one who made it more popular at least initially because they started doing research on that in the late 90s early 2000s at least in the published literature so yeah i think the idea is is that it it mimics something that he had felt before in the gym and he wanted to see how he could try and do that and ultimately he found that you can use very light weights low loads but make it feel like you're lifting very very heavy weights which is obviously useful you know if you have a ski an accident or you don't want to lift heavy weights or you have some sort of injury yeah i had a patient last year who was playing with his kids and tore his bicep had a complete tear so he underwent a surgical repair of that but we decided to have him use blood flow restriction during the rehab phase so that he could get back to training",

        "text": "sooner obviously under a far less load and sure although it's anecdotal i mean it was a remarkable recovery that he made which further kind of peaked my curiosity around this so this this term katsu is kind of synonymous with blood flow restriction is it i mean i think it's japanese for like training with pressure or training with added pressure or something to that effect correct yeah it means increasing pressure so it's just a brand okay yeah it's the it's the one that's i i think it's fair to say is one of the first but it's just a brand so we started using i think a lot of people will use katsu as just kind of a generic name but it probably shouldn't be done unless you're using the katsu apparatus but yeah it's a form of blood flow restriction so i want to come back to the different types of apparatus but let's let's kind of talk through it now maybe uh chronologically in terms of the most insights like if i if i was to go back in time to the 1970s and i'm sato and i'm trying to think about how to test this hypothesis it seems like hands down the easiest way to do this would be to use individuals as their own controls and isolate and compress you know one side and not do for the other and have them do the same things or do different things and try to isolate the variables so was that the first experiment that was done yeah the the first experiment done on blood flow restriction at least to my knowledge on how we think of blood flow restrictions",

        "text": "so you know i i always add a lot of caveats because some people will say well if you look in the 30s there were studies done where they applied a cuff but it wasn't done for for the purposes of increasing muscle function so to my knowledge uh with blood flow restriction how we use it shinohara published the first paper in 1998 where they had individuals that all they were looking at was strength but they had one leg do a certain exercise with blood flow restriction the opposite leg did the same exercise without blood flow restriction and they saw a treatment effect meaning the limb that underwent blood flow restriction saw a greater change so that's the the first study was looking at a change in actual function with blood flow restriction it's kind of amazing that that didn't happen until 1998 which is 30 years after sato began writing about this stuff or at least experimenting with it right yes the other question for me that's been very difficult to wrap my head around is what is the definition of blood flow restriction if i were to wrap a cuff around my arm and apply no pressure clearly that's no restriction if i were to create an occlusive pressure that was twice my systolic blood pressure almost certainly it would imply not a drop of blood is making its way past so there's no arterial flow and no venous return that would obviously blood flow restriction that would be blood flow restriction but like everything else you have sort of a continuum so yeah um",

        "text": "how do you think about this and maybe that's the wrong question maybe the better question is in the in the genesis of kind of the study of this how was restriction defined what methods were used and how much variability existed in the studies so the idea of blood flow restriction is to reduce blood flow going into the limb but not completely occlude blood flow so in other words we always want blood flow to be going in so there is a tremendous amount of variability in how the pressure was applied early on that's improved substantially at improvement in my opinion at least the early studies would take a cuff and apply the same pressure to every single person independent of their blood pressure independent of blood pressure independent of limb size independent of the cuff size that you're using so all of these things are important factors that you can account for by doing this one measurement that's that's how we do it now but obviously it's easy to look in the past and throw stones but there's certainly a lot of variability so given that the idea is to restrict blood flow but not occlude it completely during exercise what we started to do and others have started to do as well is before we do exercise let's just take the cuff up to the lowest pressure of which there is no flow at all so if that's 100 millimeters of mercury means that you no longer have flow going into your limb at all let's take a percentage of that so we know that you always have flow during the exercise so now do you",
