Avram Blooming who's a hematologist medical oncologist and an emeritus clinical professor at USC he's also formerly a senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute the book we discussed today is their most recent project a book called estrogen matters which has its name suggests is a book about hormones in particular it's a book about hormone replacement therapy in women now I realize at this moment about half the people listening to this ie those of you who are guys are thinking do I really need to listen to this episode and the short answer is I think you do at the very least if you know a woman or care about a woman you should be listening to this episode why because in many ways this topic has created as much confusion and generated as much bad information as any topic in medicine and yes I am including nutrition science which is the absolute bottom of our understanding of science and the sort of parallels between the story of HRT and the nutritional",
