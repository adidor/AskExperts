        "text": "okay this might be jumping around a little bit but you talked about your continuous glucose monitor and I think a couple people asked about that because they realize that you have a CGM and you're not diabetic it's usually when you have a cg on people say aren't you diabetic because it's what it's typically used for so we could get into a why do you why do you wear the CGM and then probably a pretty nerdy game of would you rather which is obviously not the glucose but let's say like an OG TT with insulin would you rather see that in a patient or if a patient could have the you know the dex cotton v or whatever the latest and greatest is and you knew exactly what they ate for like a month and you could follow those numbers where are you gonna learn more about that patient through one of those tests or the other oh it's cute question I think that to have CGM data on a patient and a lot of our patients don't want to wear a CGM although I think that's gonna change with the Dexcom g6 so I I started my career using the g5 now you know the g5 I love but I could understand why if you didn't actually have type you know diabetes you know that was a bit of a bit of a stretch because you know you're inserting this needle and it was you know it was just a bit more involved plus it required calibration twice a day then a company called Libra got bought by Abbott and they had a no calibration one that got quite popular but we've used it a lot and I find it to be categorically useless it's so inaccurate and you can't force a calibration also it doesn't have you can't it doesn't interact with your phone so it's just like useless in that regard so do those both use a needle in the same place the liebre is typically inserted on the back of the arm and it's a it was at the time a much easier way to insert the new Dexcom g6 which I don't think is out yet but I've been lucky enough to have a prototype for",

        "text": "awhile the the g6 inserts the same way as the Libra it's it's it's plug-and-play it's trivial it requires you don't even feel it going in it's a much smaller needle goes in much faster so you don't you're not you're not the one responsible for the velocity at which it goes into you and it also doesn't require calibration though you can still spot check mine once a day I've been blown away by the accuracy and its interface with the phone is second to none so it's just it's just it's it's amazing I think in reality if I had a month of CGM data with accurate food information that's probably more valuable to me than the OG TT even though I'm giving up insulin meaning I'm not gonna get to see the insulin but I also get to see you know a month of someone in their real environment eating the likelihood that I'll miss in that entire month because they're gonna probably eat something really bad and if I can see how they're reacting to that you know that's probably pretty good but look it's still not a complete substitute for that hyperinsulinemia so it's it's it's it's not perfect but I also find that the CGM for me is one of the its along with the my sleep ring it's the stickiest device I've ever used whereas any other wearable I've ever used it's like after two weeks I don't want to wear it anymore because I've already learned what I need to learn like I know how many steps I take why do I care so I've got this whole theory around what wearables matter you know it's like are you measuring something that matters I don't want a wearable that's telling me something that's irrelevant clinically is the device actually measuring what it claims to be measuring is it am I able to get feedback in real time because that was the problem with the Libra is you couldn't get real-time feedback you know unless you were gonna carry around this other device it came with whereas",
