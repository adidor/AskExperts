        "text": "and an exocrine function so the exocrine function is kind of the the local digestive function and the endocrine function is the more systemic function so this the release of insulin and glucagon from beta and alpha cells respectively fit into the endocrine portion of this and i think i could be wrong on this um my recollection is that the by mass only five percent of the pancreas is really endocrine function is alpha and beta cells that the majority of the pancreatic mass is for the exocrine the local digestive function anyway so these beta cells they secrete insulin um and insulin really has pretty significant effects on obviously muscle cells fat cells and liver cells um and it signals all of these tissues to take up glucose it also tells the liver to stop making glucose so again what what's the purpose of this it's insulin is a signal of the fed state and it's particularly sensitive of course to carbohydrates so it's saying when carbohydrates are abundant we need to take glucose up into cells and we need to stop making more glucose because remember the liver has many functions but one of the most important functions of the liver in fact you could argue the function with which we would die the quickest is its ability to make glucose and put it into circulation and this is a very important thing that insulin regulates it also regulates the output of glucagon so what is glucagon so glucagon is produced by alpha cells of the pancreas and it increases blood glucose via hepatic glucose production via stimulating glycogenolysis so breaking glycogen into glucose and gluconeogenesis",

        "text": "iv of glucose is titrated to match that dose sorry not to match the dose to match the glycemic response okay what's interesting is when you look at the two figures below so the first figure which is the green figure shows what happens to insulin under these two conditions so now again we're sampling peripheral and in the first example you see insulin goes up and this would be sort of what you would expect from an oral glucose tolerance test so insulin peaks at about 90 minutes returns to baseline in about three to four hours but what's really interesting here is when you look at the insulin response under the intravenous glucose administration you see it's a fraction of what is delivered or appreciated in the oral glucose administration in fact it almost looks like a flat line so what explains that difference well that difference which is basically the shaded green area is referred to as the incretin effect which we'll talk about in a moment so looking at the bottom graph now you see the same effect but for glucagon so remember glucagon is secreted by the pancreas as well and it acts primarily on the liver to regulate glucose output glycogen breakdown and glucose production and you can see with the oral glucose administration the attenuation of glucagon is less than with the intravenous administration so again that delta is referred to here as the incretin effect so why does this happen i guess is the question bob what what what insights do you have on this",
