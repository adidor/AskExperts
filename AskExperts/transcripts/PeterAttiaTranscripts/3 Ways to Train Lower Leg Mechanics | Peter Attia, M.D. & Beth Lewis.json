        "text": "okay so we want to talk a little bit about frontal plane motion of the foot uh so when you push off in gait your foot has to resupinate to create a rigid lever and then when you land it will go into pronation before you push off if you don't have those mechanics you're not able to absorb shock uh as efficiently so a lot of force goes up the chain so we're going to start with some simple ways to train this first and then we'll get progressively uh a little more interesting so we're going to start put your right foot right in the middle of the yoga strap and you want to make sure big toe mound and pinky toe mound are right on the strap and we're going to start with supination first actually so i'm going to have you put your left hand here yep take your left leg back just a little bit and put a little bend in the knee so you're going to round through your spine nice and relaxed up top and you're going to pull up against the strap and you'll feel how you have to fight against that yeah so we're working supination here we're actually working this medial compartment hold this for about 45 to 60 seconds and then we'll switch yep bend your knee and now it's right under that big toe mound and you can feel how you're getting that yeah you might even feel some colonials kicking in good again you'll hold this for about 45 to 60 seconds next we're going to take the toe pro and of course you'll do that on both sides and have it in from something that you can put your hands on for balance so we're going to start weight even forefoot and heels open up your heels just a little bit",
