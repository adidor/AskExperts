        "text": "historically to get into a whole mudslide of confusion and debate and disagreement there's a lot of places along the way that could in some circumstances be the bottleneck normally people tend to assume that what is it that causes vo2 max to plateau is essentially what i think what we're talking about and just one thing i should add here it's like why is that interesting it's because you think well if you want to measure endurance just have someone run a mile or whatever you know as hard as they can but any test like that depends on motivation depends on whether you pace it right there's all these factors that come into it the nice thing about vo2 max is that in theory it's independent of motivation that's why scientists like it because it doesn't matter if the subject doesn't really care about the study if you see a plateau you know that's a property of their body and not a product of whether they were excited about the study so the question is this plateau what is it that causes it and it could be in the lungs it could be the heart it could be the circulation it could be the muscle's ability to extract it i don't want to pretend that i know the answer because it's still controversial that the picture that emerges is that almost every part along this cascade is engineered more or less to what it needs to be and so if you perturb any of those elements you can get limitations so for example the conventional wisdom is that your lungs are not a limitation you can always breathe enough in and so then the question is can you diffuse enough oxygen from your lungs into your bloodstream and so on and so forth there are situations where and it's been for decades it's been conventional",

        "text": "wisdom that the lungs don't respond to training because they're overbuilt there was just a paper published a big review in the last month or two arguing that you know in some cases the lungs aren't overbuilt and one of the situations is highly trained endurance athletes they can be limited by their ability to get enough oxygen in and you can also run into situations where an athlete is so fit their heart is so strong it pumps blood past your lungs so quickly that it doesn't have time to fully stock up on oxygen you get something called exercise induced arterial hypoxemia so this this is usually an issue at altitude but in elite endurance athletes is actually about half of them exhibited even at sea level so they're already running into a limitation just in getting oxygen from their lungs to their bloodstream and then at every stage of the way there can be limitations if anything is knocked off kilter and certainly right down to the ability of the muscles to first extract the oxygen from the bloodstream and then to make use of it metabolically in the in the mitochondria so it's there isn't one single answer which is why you get these debates because everyone is i have evidence that this is the limit it's like yeah but i have evidence that this is the limit and that's the limit and they're all the limit yeah i've always wanted to see the experiment where you took a group of athletes maybe this has been done you run them all to max and then you reduce the fio2 of the incoming oxygen so normally we do it with room air so you're getting a the fractional inhalation of oxygen is 21 and the way of course just for the listener the way these things work is the way they're calculating how much oxygen is being consumed is they're measuring the concentration of oxygen on the way out",

        "text": "so you're calculating the delta and so i've always thought well wouldn't it be interesting to start selectively dropping fio2 21 20 19 18 now presumably if the lungs aren't the limitation you should still see the same absolute delta and you could at least start to eliminate one of those variables which would be fio2 and capillary exchange and then you start pointing to some of these other variables again i'm sure somebody has done this experiment but i don't know what it yielded probably not with the the fine tooth comb that you're suggesting people have compared 21 to 10 or whatever and 15 i mean it's interesting when you go to altitude or the equivalent when you reduce the amount of oxygen funny things happen like the first thing you would think would happen is like you can't get enough oxygen so you're going to go anaerobic sooner you're going to produce more lactate and yet the opposite happens there's something called the lactate paradox if you try and exercise to exhaustion at lower levels of altitude you actually give up when your lactate levels are lower than you would at sea level and there's debate about what causes this and even whether it's a real thing but the picture that makes sense to me is is that these things are not just about how much oxygen is making it to the muscle it's also like what is your brain oxygen level and so you're getting these other circuit breakers that are starting to come down that aren't even on this path from mouth to lungs to blood to muscle there's other factors that are saying whoa wait a second oxygen's getting a little low so we're gonna actually cut off the supply to the muscles or reduce",
