        "text": "when you look at organ specific sites colon cancer is generally in the top three leading causes of death for both men and women and what i'm about to say is going to sound incredibly bold and controversial it seems increasingly true to me which is nobody should ever die from colon cancer and i would add the same for esophageal and stomach and the reason for that is especially in colon the progression from non-cancer to cancer is visible to the naked eye through the transition of non-malignant polyp to malignant polyp so if you did this as a thought experiment if you did a colonoscopy on somebody every single day of their life they would never get colon cancer because at some point you would see the polyp you would remove it while it is non-cancerous and they would not get cancer so of course how do you turn that thought experiment into a real life idea well you have to ask the question what is the shortest interval of time for which a person can have a completely normal colonoscopy until they can have a cancer there's no clear answer to this question and we've done a lot of work on it and i've spoken with a lot of gastroenterologists about it and there are certainly some case reports that it can happen in as little as six to eight months of course one has to question whether in fact people had perfectly normal colonoscopies six to eight months earlier and it's possible that they did not and that something was actually missed at the time but i think most people would agree that if you had a colonoscopy every one to two years the likelihood that you could ever develop a colon cancer while maybe not",

        "text": "zero is so remote that you could effectively take colon cancer off the list of the top 10 reasons why someone dies of cancer and so it's for that reason that i'm very aggressive when it comes to this type of screening which also includes upper endoscopy so you basically get for free the esophagus and stomach when you look at the entire colon rectum anus and what are your costs well your costs are obviously the dollar cost which is not cheap i can't tell you what the average cost of a colonoscopy i think when i get them done because i'm getting them done outside of regular screening so i'm paying for them they're certainly not cheap i want to say maybe i'm paying 2 000 for a colonoscopy so that's a huge cost and then there's obviously the risk of the sedation which again is not zero in the hands of someone who's doing this every minute of every day it's very small and then of course there's the risk of perforation which again is also incredibly small especially in healthy individual and even if it does happen it's generally something that's pretty easy to manage so again is this something that i'm taking lightly no it's not and i can't tell you yet what the ideal frequency is because at some point for example a colonoscopy every day would be a silly idea on all of those metrics right your risk of complication is clearly going to exceed your risk of cancer notwithstanding the cost and daily challenges of bowel preps so where is that number i don't know but it's much more frequently than what's being done today that's what i would propose it's not every five to ten years so it's probably every one to three years would be my intuition i think the other thing there and to follow up raja's episode is episode 61 and another good resource on this is",

        "text": "after chadwick boseman passed away we did a weekly email on it and we'll link to it in the show notes it's called colorectal cancer screening and i think the other thing that was talked about in there which you do a little different is not only the frequency but the age in which you start your patients for their first colonoscopy i think the standard is 50 or 45 now but either way you prefer much earlier i think they are moving it down i mean in our practice we think 40 is the age at which a person should have their first colonoscopy if they have no history of colon cancer about when i had my first one was 40 or 41. i'm 49 right now and i'm scheduled for a colonoscopy in a month and that'll probably be my fourth one and to be clear this requires me arguing a little bit with my primary care physician who's saying peter you're being a bit ridiculous but then i say look i want you to go and read what i've written about this let's hop on a call and let's discuss this in the end he's like okay and then you could argue well maybe i get my way because i'm a doctor and i can be more persuasive in my arguments but i think these are the discussions patients need to be having with their doctors if they're in a position that they can afford to do this outside of their regular screening and if not i think they should push to see whatever can be done with inside the bounds of their insurance as well i realize that we're all tainted by our biases but the images of the people that i have seen who have had colon cancer before the age of 50 i mean those are seared into my brain and that's why i think those are just such asymmetric benefits this podcast is for general",
