        "text": "all right this is one of my favorite exercises because it's an exercise that I think everybody can learn to do safely irrespective of pre-existing injuries it's also an exercise you can do anywhere just recently I was at a hotel they had virtually not a single piece of equipment except for dumbbells and guess what with a bench and dumbbells I was able to do step UPS so we consider this a foundational movement and one of the most important ways that you will learn to load the hip and to do a so-called hip hinge during this movement you want to make sure that you're actually loading your front leg a lot of times if you're going to get up on a really high box you're just going to get up there however you can in this particular activity we want to actually be able to shift and push through the front foot so it's going to be helpful if you start on a lower box first usually around 12 inches at body weight get the mechanics and then we can increase the height and load it from there and I'd like to point out that even though I've been doing this for a long time I always do my first set at about 12 inches with body weight just to make sure I'm moving correctly and firing correctly I'll typically then add a little bit of weight at 12 inches and then I'll move to a higher box but I rarely will jump to a higher box out of the gate okay so go ahead and put a foot on and you know important things here we want to be able to shift and get load through the center of that front foot so you don't have to rely on the back foot pushing you up onto the box so go ahead and shift and come up so he's going to shift he loads the hip drives through I like to connect the heel at the top pull the toes up so you can really lock that working hip into place now on the way down the magic here and you don't have to do all your reps here but when you're learning to do it",
