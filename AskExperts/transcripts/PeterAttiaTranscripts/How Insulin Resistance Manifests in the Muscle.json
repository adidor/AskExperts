        "text": "insulin resistance is the thing that sits at the heart of metabolic syndrome and if you have even the mildest interest in being healthy you can't be insulin resistant and i don't think that can be stated enough so i'm going to say that again if you have an interest in being healthy you can't be insulin resistant if you are insulin resistant you're not going to be healthy now there are different degrees of that right you could be mildly insulin resistant and you know maybe it doesn't shorten your life by a decade but if you're in the business of wanting to live the healthiest life you can live which means longer and better you've got to be insulin sensitive full stop and that's why we're going through this discussion so let's talk about what insulin does at a more detailed level so that we can begin to talk about what goes wrong so bob i'm kind of looking at our notes here and i'm looking at the picture on page 15 that we'll we'll show folks this one's titled normal postprandial response to insulin so you got a little person there a little cartoon character they're eating a nice piece of bread so that piece of bread gets broken down into its constitutive starch molecules of which glucose is the main one glucose stimulates the pancreas to secrete insulin insulin does basically a couple of things it tells the liver hey stop making glucose because if the liver was still making glucose you would now have a very high level of blood glucose which we never want and it tells the muscle take glucose in the muscle is the predominant place where we dispose of glucose so you'll hear me say this term glucose disposal glucose",

        "text": "disposal all day long it just means muscle taking in glucose so what goes wrong here and again when i say wrong i think it's important to understand this is a continuum that on one end of the spectrum is just becoming insulin resistant and at the other end of the spectrum is full-blown type 2 diabetes so it's really everything we're talking about is just a gradation along a spectrum so the first thing that really goes wrong here is the muscles take in less glucose and by extension the plasma insulin level has to rise to force that in so the first sign of this is normal levels of glucose going in but at a higher level of insulin so that's easy to miss so the first thing that usually shows up is higher levels of plasma glucose and that's because the liver is becoming resistant to insulin which means it's not slowing down glucose production and therefore in the presence of glucose it's still making glucose which is problematic and also at some point there's not even enough insulin that the pancreas can make to overcome the resistance that we're about to dive into and at some point this becomes so bad that a person needs medication to start to overcome this problem so the first thing that i think is really worth getting super technical and nerdy on is the amazing work that jerry and his team did to understand what it is about the muscle",

        "text": "that fails in this process of glucose disposal so in the podcast he talked about there being basically three places that glucose could go three fates of glucose within the muscle the first is what we call oxidative the second is glycolytic and the third is glycogen so let's take each of those in order the oxidative fate of glucose says glucose comes into a muscle and immediately gets converted into atp through the very efficient pathway of glucose being converted to pyruvate pyruvate being converted to acetyl coa and that going into the mitochondria where atp is generated under something called oxidative phosphorylation that's called the krebs cycle people may remember that from high school biology and that's the most efficient way to generate atp out of glucose i don't even remember i think each six carbon ring glucose will yield about a net of 34 atps going in that pathway the second potential fate of glucose is to undergo glycolysis which is you take the glucose down to pyruvate but instead of taking the pyruvate towards the mitochondria and going through the krebs cycle you turn it into lactate which yields much less atp and that lactate gets recycled and there's a whole bunch of other stuff there so that would be the second fate and then the third fate of glucose in muscle is it can be stored as glycogen and i'll just pause for a moment to explain what glycogen is glycogen is literally a lattice of glucose so glucose is a single six carbon ring but you can join these things in rows and rows and rows and rows and sheets and sheets and sheets",
