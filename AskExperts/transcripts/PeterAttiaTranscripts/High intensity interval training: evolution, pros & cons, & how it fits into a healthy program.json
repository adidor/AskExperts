        "text": "seconds yeah um i just have to tell one quick story about tabata please i i was i was at a conference uh and at the poster session where the researchers are in front of their posters talking about it and i was it was a research on the uh from the mcmaster group which has popularized high intensity into interval training and one of the postdocs was there explaining his interval high intensity interval training research and someone came up and and asked him a question and handed him his business card at the time and i i noticed the postdoc he looked down as he was answering the question he glanced down at the business card and his eyebrows just went like halfway up his forehead and i peeked over and was like oh that's tabata that's cool i didn't realize this was a real person so he was he was there you know asking questions about intervals anyway um where do i think intervals fit i think they're super important when when circa 2008 when high intensity intervals started to be a big buzzword i was like how is this a buzzword that's how runners train like one of the studies out of the mcmaster group was like let's do 10 times a minute it's like that's the roger bannister that's what that's how he broke the four-minute mile in 1954. what what's new about this but it was new to a lot of people a lot of people were like i need to go 45 minutes i need to go an hour i need to do this i need to do that um so there there is let me put this i guess what i was really getting is is the is the compression of that right it's the i don't know if you saw this",

        "text": "well i'll let you finish this but then i'll bring it to where i'm going which is what are the limits of how much you oh how low yeah yeah but yeah yeah well i'll just i'll just say that and just as two general points one is that as a runner one thing i know is that you will never ever run fast relative to your abilities if you don't do interval training um the second thing i would say is you probably won't run as fast as you could if you only do interval training now some people do do only interval training but that's usually they're doing it so slowly that it's not different from just doing a sustained thing so to me when you look at the studies it's like let's compare eight weeks of three interval workouts a week to eight weeks of three 45-minute sustained sessions it's like okay that's interesting it's it's it's useful to know but i i really don't think that's what is optimized and what we should be comparing it just what about one short interval sprint interval session one medium interval session and one 45-minute session that's or or you know some portfolio is to me because there's pretty clear evidence that you get you can get to the same or some of the same health outcomes you can get the same improvement in insulin sensitivity sensitivity say but the mechanisms may be different if you if you're doing a sprint interval session versus or if you're doing sprint uh interval training versus sustained training and so it's like well if you've got two different mechanisms let's hit them both because presumably we're going to get a little one plus one is going to be at",
