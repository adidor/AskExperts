        "text": "they're all probably similar that said I have patients who say like I developed low desire on Prozac or I have difficulty with orgasm on searching but on Paxil but not on so I'm not on Prozac so we sometimes tried a few if I think in SSRI is the best choice that's definitely been our experience clinically is that yeah there's a class effect but at the end of the day it's kind of drug specific and I always tell patients look if you're if you're because we're not the ones that are prescribing those we're not psychiatrists but but if your doctor is prescribing you an SSRI or an snri um I always say the probability that you're going to get it right on the first one in terms of efficacy and side effects is actually not that high so you have to be willing to switch drugs to find that right combination of efficacy and avoidance of side effects and you'll you'll be able to stay within the same class usually but but it's you know there seem to be um you know non-trivial effects right so again we're talking about the condition that you're treating it for usually it's depression or anxiety right and then there's the side effects which amongst um is sexual dysfunction so then there's another category the snris that stands the certain urgent norepinephrine drugs which I know you're familiar with there's more variability in the data on that um so there's Duloxetine there's venlofaxine which is efaxer which is probably the most commonly used one and then there's um Pristiq which is des venlofaxine they're probably all of them are probably similar to the ssris but venlofaxine is interesting at a low level low dose it functions more like an SSRI and that is you kick in above somewhere like 75 is up to 75 is probably low somewhere over",
