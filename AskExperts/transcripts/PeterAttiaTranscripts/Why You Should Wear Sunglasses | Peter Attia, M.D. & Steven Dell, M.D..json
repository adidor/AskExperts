        "text": "northern european ancestry is a risk factor for macular degeneration probably because of the lack of pigment because that pigment is protecting that very vulnerable uh vascularized component of the back of the eye oh wait so the darker your eye the more protected you are absolutely in the same way that your skin is more protected and more melanin so light eyed patients have more light getting in from the front of the eye and so their iris literally blocks less light hitting the lens yes and their the retina has less pigment behind it and so the vascular supply to the retina is more exposed to uv light and that's the way it's evolved because they've been in environments that don't have as much light available but if you live near the equator or your ancestry is from that area then you're going to have more pigment and from an evolutionary standpoint but i understand the fanaticism about wanting to have lots of blue light or you know bright light but i think that it probably is fanaticism i don't think that you know at least if your goal is to reproduce teach your children until they're 15 and then die then get all the light you want but if your goal is longevity or the the postponement of senescence certainly ocular senescence i think it makes sense to protect your eyes from uv light so for example like let's so you you came over here today where it's middle of the day in austin it's a typical austin beautiful sunny day you're driving with sunglasses oh for sure absolutely 100 okay so you you're in sunglasses when you're outside i am after what time in the morning if i'm outside and the and my vision is",
