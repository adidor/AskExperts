        "text": "insights about berberine so berberine is a plant derived extract that has two properties one of which it gets a lot of attention for one of which it might not be as well known the first is that it is a weak am p kinase activator and for those of you that have you know shown an interest in what metformin does that's sort of the the that's probably the secret sauce of metformin is its AMPK activation so berberine when taken at you know sort of recommended OTC doses which I remember the doses anymore I think it's like a it might be actually a comparable dose to metformin it might be like either 500 twice a day or a thousand twice a day does have some of that weak ampk activation and what that the net effect of that is it decreases hepatic glucose output so it's up regulating ampk is telling the liver hey you can make less glucose so send less glucose out of the body and so in that sense it's a poor man's version of metformin I don't find that that interesting I prefer to just use metformin if we're gonna you know we're gonna go down that path like let's do it pharmacologically with you know potent drugs that we understand that are consistent from batch to batch that have a much higher sort of oversight of regulation that kind of stuff the other thing about berberine and this is that this is when I still do use it in clinical practice is it is also a weak inhibitor of the enzyme pcsk9 which any listener this podcast is going to be very well up to speed on what pcsk9 is the word on the street is it probably only works in a subset of people who over express pcsk9 so if you so pcsk9 is a is a is a protein that degrades LDL receptors so if you overexpress this enzyme you're going to really degrade LDL receptors you're gonna have a higher LDL particle number and probably a higher LDL cholesterol if you take that subset of patients they seem to respond quite",

        "text": "nicely to berberine now the question is how do you know that I don't think there's a test anymore to measure that after attack which I think might have got absorbed into vApp or something like that I think he used to have a test but in the end I was like why am I gonna do some tests on somebody to see if they over Express pcsk9 before I give them bourbon I'll just give them berberine make no other change and see if there's not a significant enough difference in their LDL I don't care and every once in a while you just you look like a rock star you get this patient who's LDL is really high and you check your boxes like they don't have their triglycerides aren't that high they're phytosterols are not that high their stands are not that high they're does mothballs not that high hey they clearly have defective LDL clearance maybe they overexpressed pcsk9 which would be one of a thousand reasons you could have hot like literally there are 2,000 genetic mutations that can lead to an inability to clear out there was that because this is like one of them but this one amounts to about 5% of them and so in that patient you hit them with berberine and all of a sudden like everything's fixed do you see that with metformin at all no no I don't think that Foreman possesses that that that that piece of what berberine has",
