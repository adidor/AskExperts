[Music] peter welcome to another ama how you doing i'm doing well we just spent the last 15 minutes talking about why season four of drive to survive was not good so i wish we could continue on that discussion but i don't think anybody wants to hear us talk about formula one anymore yeah it will be interesting to see i mean on the positive front we picked a topic for today that you're second most excited about in terms of right after formula one which is nutrition and in particular fruits and vegetables so i'm sure the excitement we had in our little intro on formula one will be carried over to this one what do you think i think it's hilarious that most people listening to this don't appreciate the sarcasm in your comment that might be true this one's not via video so they can't see you smirking and smiling over there so they might think we're being dead serious this is polar opposite discussion all things formula",
