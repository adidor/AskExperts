        "text": "mutations and it's only been in the last i'd say three or four years that we now recognize these mutations as commonly recognized by the immune system and about 80 percent of patients with the common epithelial cancers it turns out as a result of the research done in recent years do exist that can recognize the products of the mutations but the immune system against them is too small it's not vigorous enough what does that mean create enough cells create receptors that have a high enough avidity for recognition to the uh to the tumor the immune reaction is not very strong and the growth of the tumor can overcome the small impact that an immune reaction might have in killing some some tumor cells plus for a tumor cell to survive and grow it develops certain properties that can suppress the local immune reaction it can make molecules like transforming growth factor beta tgf beta it can make cytokines like interleukin 10. it can cause the development of cells lymphocytes that inhibit immune reactions i mean virtually every physiologic system in the body has stimulatory elements and inhibitory elements you have hormones that can increase gastric secretion some that can decrease it you have a sympathetic nervous system a parasympathetic nervous system well the immune system is the same it has effector cells that can be very aggressive in recognizing antigens and it has regulatory t cells that deliberately suppress immune reactions and that's one of the things that keeps us from developing autoimmune autoimmune disease but there are many of these regulatory elements recently",

        "text": "described myeloid derived suppressor cells can suppress immune reactions and so it's the balance of the aggressive immune reaction against the inhibitory molecules that can prevent that immune reaction that is the holy grail of trying to find effective effective treatments and effective treatments come in both directions interleukin-2 stimulates immune reactions and we now have checkpoint modulators like hippolyme or pd-1 inhibitors that can unleash can inhibit these inhibitory factors and thereby stimulate the immune reaction by taking away the breaks on the immune system so the more we understand the more we can take advantage of the biology [Music]",
