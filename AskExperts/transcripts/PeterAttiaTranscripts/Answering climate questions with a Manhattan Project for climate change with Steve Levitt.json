        "text": "okay so so not withstanding that problem i think my biggest fear steve is there's no question that in five years a well-staffed well-resourced team could come up with what solutions might look like i just don't know that it could ever be implemented from a policy perspective i mean for example i mean i i don't think anybody who's really studied energy seriously disagrees that nuclear energy next gen not i'm not talking about like the nuclear reactors of 70 years ago i don't think there's anybody who doesn't think that next-gen nuclear would play an important role in electricity generation but it's just not a politically palatable solution i don't know where geo engineering falls on that spectrum either for that matter so that would be my fear is you'd come up with solutions but then you'd still be at kind of a gridlock in the implementation of these things yeah so that's uh so that is a good point and that is possible i do think however that one even in that world there is a real insurance value in this investment now so we might not be able to come up with a sensible policy now but if in 20 years all of a sudden the ice shelf on greenland just like begins to slide into the ocean and things are desperate then i believe that we will my prediction is we will do something like my manhattan project for climate change the question's just when will we do it will we do it as we're staring down you know catastrophe or we will we do it in advance and potentially either avoid catastrophe",
