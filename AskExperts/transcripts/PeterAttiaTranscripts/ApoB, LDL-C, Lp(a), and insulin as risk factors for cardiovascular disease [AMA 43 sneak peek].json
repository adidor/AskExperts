        "text": "so now the question is why what's the mechanistic explanation for this I think the two that are most important are the impact that insulin and insulin resistance has on the expression of apoc3 so APO C3 is an is another lipoprotein so April lipoprotein C3 it's a very interesting one it's probably come up on a previous podcast perhaps where I it might have been on the one with near barceli I know I write about it in the book but it is one of the uh genes so the APO C3 Gene is one of the sort of centenarian genes so centenarians are more likely to have a version of that Gene that results in lower expression uh so in other words you can think of it that that's a good thing so the bad version of that is you know what we see the expression uh pattern in people with hyperinsuline insulin resistance is that we kind of upregulate that and if we do that if we increase the expression of that it blocks the activation of something called lipoprotein lipase or LPL and LPL is um uh is an enzyme that sits on cells that basically uh performs a function of controlling lipolysis so it um so so one of the side effects we see of blocked LPL activity is less utilization of triglyceride uh and an increase so if you're using them less what's happening you're increasing the amount of triglyceride you have so now let's think back to what does that mean so if you increase the concentration of triglyceride and again clinically that's very obvious you measure that in a standard lipid panel we know that risk goes up but the question is through what mechanism well it goes up through apob why because triglycerides like cholesterol are not water soluble they're fat soluble which means they can't be trafficked on their own they",
