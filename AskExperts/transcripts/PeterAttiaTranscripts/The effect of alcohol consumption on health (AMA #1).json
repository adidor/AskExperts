        "text": "alcohol thoughts on consumption of alcohol she's a little generic okay so I put this into a couple of categories the first is just a purely physiologic what is the effect of the molecule ethanol on the body and just as I sort of talked about sugar or other things it's really important to understand that ethanol is a toxin but of course the dose makes the poison now the thing that I think many people forget who are not in the world of toxicology is that there is a probability distribution that drives the impact of a toxin on a population and there are going to be some people at one end of the spectrum who are largely unimpacted by certain toxins and there are going to be others who are not and so ethanol is no exception to that just as you know tylenol or pick your favorite poison could be so again tylenol meaning like even though it's at low dose is very efficacious as an analgesic at high enough doses it's a Patou toxic so start with position 1 I'm not convinced that there is a single benefit to ethanol the molecule in the human body so ethanol in its metabolic pathway and it's uniquely metabolized by the liver one of the byproducts is something called aldehyde which is a toxin it really has to in this is a bit of an oversimplification but it has two effects so there's an effect on the liver and then there's effect on the brain the effect on the brain is what people drink alcohol for it's the buzz it's the CNS depression that also comes with some youth Oriya so it's a bit of a paradox there because ethanol it's affecting the CNS as that of a GABA agonist and and gaba of course being is a non excitatory or depressing neurotransmitter but I think as most people will understand a certainly ethanol can have an excitatory effect so you've got this brain affective alcohol you get this liver affect the liver effect is you know very similar to that",
