        "text": "so let's kind of now tie this all together for a totally different type of athlete that most people aren't thinking about right which is the centenarian athlete um and I'm not assuming that we're starting from the standpoint of having been world-class Olympic cross-country skiers in our 20s who never stop I'm talking about somebody who's in their 40s who I don't know kind of has the Epiphany that says wait a minute like it's cool to be a power lifter it's cool to be a weight lifter it's cool to be a CrossFit or a strong man an elite Runner cyclist swimmer whatever but I'm gonna pick a different sport I'm going to pick a sport where the optimization is around my ability to be as physically robust as possible in the last decade of my life which you know means I want to be able to do a bunch of things that most people can't even fathom when they're you know 80 or 90 years old um that you know that means like I can run up an escalator if it's broken carrying my luggage I can put the 25 pound bag in the overhead compartment of the airplane I can pick a grandchild up out of a crib I can play on the floor and stand up on my own no issues right I can go for a hike on Rocky Terrain and I'm not going to slip and fall you know things that you would do blindfolded today but the number of people in the last decade of their life that can do this you can count on a few hands so I'm gonna argue that to train for that you have to make trade-offs right one of the biggest trade-offs you have to make is optimizing against getting injured because the compounding effect of training is so strong",
