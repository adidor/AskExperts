        "text": "suffered from depression because of their Ed 37 of men who have Ed have anxiety because of their Ed we know that it causes impairment and quality of a relationship between a couple and if you look at quality of life scores they're significantly impaired in men who suffer from sexual dysfunction and so when you said suffering in silence you weren't just referring to Peyronie's disease you're talking about also sexual all sexual dysfunction so so there's there's reasons for that so one is if you look at surveys it was actually I got to bring this up because it wasn't a great survey that came out last year 1500 men surveyed between the ages of 18 and 80 and they asked about their mental physical and sexual health so in my world it's mental physical and Sexual Health it's it's a Triad not mental and physical and they're all related but the survey found that roughly 40 of men that in the survey had some degree of sexual dysfunction right 50 of those men said I would love to get treatment but I don't know where to go but was very interesting the Clincher was only 51 of those men told their doctor about it only 44 of those men told their partner or their wife about it that's suffering in silence and the main reason was they were embarrassed also clinicians don't ask about it they never when you go to a doctor's office and my wife is guilty my wife's a family practitioner and I said she said to me look I have to take care of diabetes hypertension Osa and all these conditions in x amount of time and Ed tends to be the bottom of the list so I'm not gonna I don't have the time to ask about it so clinicians don't ask about it patients are embarrassed to ask about it and that's the suffering and silence well uh look one of the desired outcomes of this podcast of course is to empower um people of you know both sexes plus their Physicians to hopefully take a more active role in this",
