I've already had three colonoscopies I get them every three years and I will continue to do that until my life expectancy is so short that it becomes irrelevant and um again totally different approach um so we we have to con and am I suggesting that you know everybody get a colonoscopy through this of course I'm not right what I'm suggesting is that everybody think about their own risk reward trade-off and decide what's the what's the cost benefit analysis so there's an enormous cost to doing that my insurance company doesn't pay for most of those they've paid for one of the three um there are risks of bowel preps right you can you know you do these you do a bowel prep in a person who's significantly older who runs risks from the electrolyte abnormalities that come from those things all of those things have to be you know I certainly wouldn't want my 86 year old dad getting a colonoscopy under any circumstance that ship has sailed right he the bow prep alone could injure him let alone the sedation of it so so one has to be very thoughtful and measured in how they think about doing these things um and I think the long answer to your question is I think when people talk in blanket statements like cancer screening is bad uh they're generally speaking through the lens of policy and population and it kind of leads to another question we saw come through quite a bit which is you know sometimes on the podcast it can get technical can kind of get in the weeds a lot of people were curious",
