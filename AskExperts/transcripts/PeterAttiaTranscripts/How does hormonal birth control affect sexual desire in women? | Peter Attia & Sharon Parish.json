        "text": "some of my colleagues in this area who do like sexual pain and vestibular DNA work say it's somewhere around 10 percent um meaning ten percent of women that are receiving systemic yeah okay who are receiving systems that's probably similar with rings and patches but it's not as well documented and and and then there's some variability like higher dose or oral uh contraceptives have been um more likely um low I'm sorry the very low dose have been more likely implicated and people do better if they have like more robust high dose like sort of more standard 35 microgram pills as opposed to these ultra low like the 20 microns like is low lowestrin considered low yes yes that's an example so the ultra low ones tend to be the biggest culprits that said um the experts in the field feel this is very important for us to understand the ordinary gynecologic Community thinks it's it's relatively insignificant whether they're under detecting this particular piece of it or not is is something that needs more development the other issue with birth control pills is that it can't have an effect on neurotransmitters and sometimes women will develop mood issues with as you probably know with like high-dose oral contraceptives um and that may have an impact on the neurotransmittal milia and the mix that leads to sexual dysfunction and low low sex drive so um then finally and this is probably more important as when we get a little older it might lead us into the discussion about testosterone is that birth so so three things one is they can have an effect on the local vulvar tissue right if we have this issue with particularly the lowest dose estrogen the other thing is depends on the androgenicity of the birth control pill um that's not the that's that that's yet another issue",

        "text": "um and there are Androgen receptors in the Volvo vaginal tissue so that may change sensitivity or even lead to pain that piece of it the second thing is that that intercept intersection with brain neurotransmitters and mood and that effect on sexual function could also be clinically important and then finally and this is like oh like a whole nother thing um what do you do when you make all send all that hormone to someone's body you increase the production of shpg right so so you're binding up more of the hormone right so right you need something well the easiest way to think about it is you need something to carry it around with right and that shpg goes up in other states like pregnancy um and you might ask me like is it the same with versatiles and pregnancy or when you take thyroid hormone any there are other things that make that production of that go up um the data across situations is can like you could say okay it's like around 100 such with this or is not so clear I think it's best just to say it makes it go up um now um the that is a hundred percent of women like I get asked this question like does it matter 100 of women have a higher shpd if they take for example let's just say high-dose birth control pills right let's just stick to that for now everybody who takes it has that and what does that do so it it helps carry it around but it also on you know fortunately or unfortunately whatever you want it's a the fellow Travelers androgens or testosterone gets carried by shpg so because you're increasing shpg there's some um thinking that you're binding up the circulating testosterone and you may be lowering free testosterone in those women and that might be another potential contributor low desire [Music]",
