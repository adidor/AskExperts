        "text": "is called erectin why is this important erectin as a chemical is a wake promoting chemical when you release and dump erection into the brain and the body it wakes the brain up it's an alerting chemical and normally it shuts down at night and that's part of the mechanism of what we call the sleep wake switch it's in the brain it's these erection cells outside of fasting matt what keeps erection in check what attenuates erection during a fed state so leptin and ghrelin will regulate that but it's also regulated by the master circadian clock by the suprachiasmatic nucleus many of our hormones and our chemicals erection included seem to be under the control of our 24-hour circadian rhythm and that's regulated by another part of the brain very close to the hypothalamus in fact it sits very close to the hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus which is the central master clock of the brain and that regulates the release of other things like melatonin from the pineal gland and therefore the instruction is given out as to when to release wake promoting chemicals like erection and when to release sleep-promoting chemicals that's part of the regulation of erection but another part of regulation of erection is independent of your sleep wake schedule it's dependent on your body's energy balance and this brings us back to fasting which is to say that when an animal is placed under conditions of starvation then the erection system senses a change in the energy balance of the organism and it does something remarkable because human beings are the only species that will deliberately deprive themselves of sleep for no apparent good reason the only time that we see this in nature",

        "text": "is under extreme circumstances a good example is in some species when they're giving birth killer whales for example when they leave the pod they go out to a different location they give birth to a calf and then they will sleep deprive themselves to protect the calf on the way back to the main part the other example is starvation when animals go under conditions of starvation which essentially is fasting a fasting signal then these erection cells sense the change in the energy balance they start dumping out more erection and they force the animal artificially awake for a longer period of time the animal will selectively sleep less why is this because it's recognizing that the amount of time the animal is normally awake for it to forage for food in its standard perimeter of geography is not sufficient because it's starving so it needs to stay awake for longer so it can forage in a broader perimeter and stay away from starvation now when you go under conditions of fasting this is what i think is happening that you are giving the body an evolutionary ancient signal of starvation and what happens the brain kicks in it dumps more erection into the system and therefore your sleep becomes compressed now that sleep when it gets compressed one of the things that it does and we see this when we do sleep restriction therapy for patients with insomnia is that the quality of their sleep will actually increase a little bit now you can't sustain that and you never want to sustain that and you similarly don't want to sustain that in fasting but it's partly the reason why you see some of your sleep metrics improve because the brain is trying to do more within a shorter period of time but that's not sustainable ps you can't do that all of the time and we understand that from the science but for that short",
