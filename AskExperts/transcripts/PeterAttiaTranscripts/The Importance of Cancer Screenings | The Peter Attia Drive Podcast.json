        "text": "so the adjuvant setting is when a drug is given to a patient who has no visible cancer so these are patients that may have had the visible cancer removed you believe that they have microscopic disease that remains and you give them a drug like herceptin for a her2 new positive breast cancer and if you compare the outcomes of those patients to the outcomes of patients who were given the exact same drug for the exact same phenotype and genotype of the cancer but in the metastatic setting there's no comparison in the outcomes and one explanation for that may be that the more mature cancers the ones that have been around longer have developed more mutations they are more difficult to treat so it is therefore my belief that the more we can do to screen for cancer and catch it earlier the better we will be but we do pay a price for that we pay a financial price for that in other words it costs money to screen early and we pay potentially an emotional price from that because as we'll get to and you alluded to we have to now get into false positives and false negatives but at a high level bob that's that's how i think about this cancer or that this topic around cancer screening yeah i think it's it's telling too if you look at statistics um on that they call it five-year survival so what are the odds of you surviving a cancer and then if you look at specific cancers like breast cancer you're talking about uh you catch it early and it's a it's a local cancer it hasn't metastasized and the statistics on that is the five-year survival rates are 90 about 99",
