        "text": "when it comes to alzheimer's disease our focus now on genes outside of apoe is pretty significant i don't think richard and i have ever spoken about this on a podcast richard isaacson but it's probably something we need to revisit we're working on a paper right now that we'll get into some of this stuff but it turns out that there are a lot of genes that seem to modify the risk of apoe so anybody listening to this who's been regular listening to the podcast is undoubtedly familiar with apo e and it's three subtypes type two three and four and of course you get two of each so you get two two genes so you can have the six possible combinations there the fourth isoform of that is the high-risk one so if you're a 2-4 it seems to more or less be a wash maybe slight increase in risk the 3-4 seems to be associated with about a two to three-fold risk in alzheimer's disease and the 4-4 probably about an eight to 12-fold or maybe eight to ten-fold increase in risk but we also know at the individual level that even though everything i just said is true at the population level it doesn't explain what happens at the individual level because there are some individuals who walk around with four fours who don't seem to get alzheimer's disease or if they do they get it very late in life and it's indistinguishable from the sort of population variant so they're not getting this variant where they're being taken over by this disease at the age of 61 or something horrible like that it turns out that there are a bunch of other genes that we're now starting to understand modify the risk of e4 some things make it more significant some things make it less so there are certain haplotypes of",

        "text": "the tom 40 gene that amplify risk there are certain mitochondrial haplotypes that amplify risk one of the most exciting genes is the clotho modifier i think it's klvs is the modified snip of clotho that actually seems to erase all of the downside of apoe4 so apoe4 people who have this cloth oh subtype have baseline risk so one other thing that i'm now becoming really interested in unfortunately the ways to measure these other genes it's very challenging and we have to do it by brute force today so we don't yet have a standardized way to do this so it takes a lot of time and costs a lot of money to take a whole genome sequence and do the search for all of these other subtypes takes months a big step in the right direction here is going to be getting more data and getting those data for less than twenty thousand dollars per person yeah that was going to be my follow-up question is how does someone go about getting those genes tested do you have a rough timeline in when that might be more widely available or even less cost prohibitive is that years down the road is that 10 years longer it should be sooner you know this is a solvable problem i think this is just about throwing enough dollars at it and a lot of our patients have actually expressed an interest in this and a few of them are actually kind of working with richard isaacson on ways to potentially speed this up and streamline how it's done but unfortunately at this moment in time whenever we do this it is a brute force labor intensive exercise that again we have the technical chops to be able to do if we can streamline this podcast is for general informational purposes",
