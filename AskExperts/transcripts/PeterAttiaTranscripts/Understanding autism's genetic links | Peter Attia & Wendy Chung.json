        "text": "heritability is one calculates heritability as a measure of the inherited genetic factors but you've mentioned it once already one of the factors in autism is that there are de novo or new genetic variants that occur for the first time in the individual with autism and those individuals aren't captured in that measure of heritability because heritability is fundamentally trying to get it transmitted genetic variants that are going from parent to child and those de novo genetic events or new in the child and so their genetic aspects not included inheritability if that makes sense yep yep so what are the genes that seem to be responsible for autism uh so depending on who you ask and how you want to Define this there I think everyone would agree there are at least 100 genes that have been identified with high confidence as being associated with autism depending on how rigorous you want to be about this process than you know some people would say that we estimate that there are at least a thousand genes and we probably you know are about a third of the way there in terms of having some sense of those genes not surprisingly those genes are genes that are in the brain they're expressed in the brain they function in the brain not surprisingly and many of those genes are especially early or active during developments and so what I mean is intrauterine fetal development within the brain specifically and what do they code for I mean how many of those genes would be genes in the exome versus the intron so um most of the ones we recognize underscore the ones we recognize are in the coding sequence but that's a limitation of what we recognize we do realize that statistically we see that there is a signal in the non-coding space but we have less evidence to implicate specific genes or specific",
