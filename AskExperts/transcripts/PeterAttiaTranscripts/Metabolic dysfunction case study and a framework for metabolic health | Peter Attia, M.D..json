        "text": "metabolic syndrome is partially defined by two of those so again for everybody's remembrance what is metabolic syndrome so it's a syndrome that is meant to closely approximate insulin resistance and it's defined by having three at least three of the following five things waste above a certain circumference that differs from men and women but basically truncal obesity high blood pressure low hdl cholesterol high triglycerides and high fasting blood sugar so this is a really interesting patient because we'll go through his checklist his hdl cholesterol is 54 milligrams per deciliter doesn't meet the criteria the cutoff is 35 he's well above that the triglyceride cut off i think is 150 this patient is 69 so i mean the guy's in great shape his waist does not meet the criteria his blood pressure i have to go back and look he might have triggered it on blood pressure but maybe not and his fasting glucose was 94 and his hemoglobin a1c by the way 5.6 so this is a guy who goes to the doctor and gets the cleanest bill of health let me repeat this you look at his lipid panel and it looks great total cholesterol 166 ldl cholesterol 199 hdl cholesterol 54 triggs i mean who isn't jealous about this guy you go a little bit further and you say well okay let me see what his glucose was because everybody checks the glucose right and his glucose is 94 hemoglobin a1c is 5.6 this guy doesn't have diabetes i mean this guy's a rock star there is nothing that could go wrong with this guy let's send him out the door but what if we dig a little deeper so you look at his lfts and his alt so lft is a liver function test you look at his alt it's 32 and his ast is 32.",

        "text": "now liver function test is a bit of a misnomer here these are enzymes that are produced by the liver under the stress of the liver so as the liver is experiencing any inflammation or scarring these numbers will get higher and higher and higher and we think of normal as generally below 20 but the lab says normal is below 40. we've had this discussion at length bob i'm pretty sure and i know i think rob lustig actually discussed this on one of the episodes as well so 32 and 32 is acceptable but that's interesting okay it's not perfect the other thing that kind of would strike you as you dig a little deeper is his fibrinogen which is an inflammatory marker is 495 just a little bit outside of normal and his highly sensitive c-reactive protein is 1.3 again most people wouldn't think anything of it most people think anything below two is fine we kind of like to see it below one that's a bit odd so we dig a little bit deeper and we see his homocysteine is 12 which again the lab thinks is fine but we don't think that that's fine his uric acid is 7.8 which even the lab says oh that's getting borderline but of course the lab is only thinking about this through the lens of uric acid from the standpoint of gout i'm already jumping up and down because i'm coming at this through the lens of rick johnson so if anybody hasn't listened to the podcast with rick johnson hit pause on this one make sure you go back and listen to that one if you really want to understand why uric acid matters and i've been so influenced by rick's thinking for the past four years that i've been fastidious in making sure that patients have uric acid below five non-negotiable in fact if we can get a patient's uric acid level down into the twos and threes i think it's operative and we've seen incredible benefits on",

        "text": "people's blood pressure and insulin resistance simply by reducing uric acid so all of a sudden this guy doesn't look like a rock star so i want to be really clear this guy is o for five on metabolic syndrome he looks to be as insulin sensitive as they come and yet his uric acid is 7.8 his homocysteine is 12 he's got signs of inflammation and now let's get to the interesting part which is when you look at his fasting insulin it's 15. that's actually quite high and then when we do the ogtt at 90 minutes his glucose goes up to 163 from 94 and his insulin goes to 170 and at one hour his glucose is still elevated at 139 whilst his insulin continues to climb now at 181 and by 90 minutes he finally gets it under control with the glucose back to baseline at 92 and insulin while still dramatically elevated at least down to 50. again you could almost say peter this is just as much a reason to be doing ogtts and didn't you say you were done talking about ogtts and the answer is yes i thought i was done talking about gtts but i forgot about his og ttt until i looked at it here but the point here is this is a guy who metabolically slips through the cracks so the teaching point here is you can't in my opinion just look at the traditional markers of does this person have met sin yes or no you've got to dig a little bit deeper [Music]",
