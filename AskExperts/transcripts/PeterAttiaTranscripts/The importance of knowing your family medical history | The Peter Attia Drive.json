        "text": "okay the next question is you mentioned asking your patients about their family history and how important that is i know we got into that about how important it is how much you can learn from getting a family history and this person asked what questions or information do you ask new patients on family history oh i'm glad somebody asked that question because i something i feel so strongly about a lot of times patients will come in and they'll say i have my 23andme data is that all you need and i was like actually that pretty much tells me nothing we'll take it thank you very much and we will scour the hell out of it and we'll find out if you have a tom 40 snip and that'll increase your risk of alzheimer's disease and maybe you've got a certain fox o3 snip and there's some interesting stuff here and there obviously the genes that we think really matter we're measuring on our own such as the mthfr genes and of course the apoe but what i say to them is look this stuff doesn't mean jack compared to your family history once in a while you'll see a patient who's been adopted or has been estranged from some part of their family for which that's simply impossible to know and that is what it is but for somebody who's not in that situation we actually give our patients a template to be filled out in advance of our first meeting and the template goes through the following so for mother father both sets of grandparents and all aunts and uncles and siblings we actually want to know everything that is knowable so our template is really painful for the patients i will acknowledge that up front so starting with cardiovascular disease does anybody have a history of cardiovascular disease did they take any medication for blood pressure cholesterol did they ever have",

        "text": "it may sound silly but it's almost like doing a book report when you're young and you're doing it on your dad or somebody like that and then just extending it out and then you may learn some things that are really surprising like you're talking about your dad's brother died of a heart attack at age 50 and then you found out they have more siblings and they had cardiovascular disease and it seems a little bit younger and realize like if you haven't looked at it before that you can start to connect some dots there just looking at family history rather than looking at labs i think it's a really important thing i didn't even do my own until somewhat recently in the level of detail that i would expect of a patient and that was kind of humbling first to realize hey i hadn't done it but two to actually learn the information about the true mortality of all the aunts and uncles and even now by the way i can't really provide a single shred of insight about how my paternal grandparents died because they died before my dad was even married my dad is potentially the world's single worst historian so asking him anything about how his mom and dad died i might as well use a ouija board he just keeps rambling off things that make absolutely no sense so i can absolutely relate to my patients who come in and complain of the same thing which is i asked my dad how his parents died or asked my mom how her parents died and they just said they make up something that sounds completely nonsensical so i truly have no clue how his parents died and and frankly i probably have no clue about a bunch of things in my family history so it's tough and but you do the best you can and that information usually pays off quite a bit",
