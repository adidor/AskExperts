        "text": "placebo here's where i punted when i calculated the absolute risk i punched the 19. i divided 19 by total cases carelessly and 80 by total cases carelessly and got an elevated ar absolute risk um obviously here i've corrected that this number is correctly shown as the uh overall number number of severe critical cases by the total number of participants not cases okay makes sense same thing is done over here again the math does not change the delta between those has become the arr and the reciprocal of those is the number needed to treat so now the question now the issue is if you want to prevent a very severe critical infection you have to treat 321 people and when you go down to hospitalization requiring icu admission it was two participants versus 29 participants and that gave you an absolute risk reduction of 0.14 and again the reciprocal of that is 729 and i believe yesterday i had numbers in the 20s here because i had done the same stupid mistake here which was i had divided this by the total number of cases as opposed to the uh total number of participants okay and here's the point that doesn't change from yesterday which was really the whole point of the post all of this was was basically prologue to what i wanted to say which is in the case of the vaccine there were zero deaths in the case of the placebo there were seven deaths so that's an absolute risk of 0.04 that's a rate of death of 358 per million",
