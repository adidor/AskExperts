        "text": "important because if you have a man who starts out with a testosterone level of 190 and you put them on testosterone his PSA should go up it should go up if he's at 290 and you put him on testosterone it should not go up and if you take the guy from 290 and take him to 3 000 should not go up because it's saturated right so it it plateaus so so that's why if I give someone Lupron that testosterone goes down but the PSA goes down right but if you raise the testosterone it's not the more I raise it the more the PSA goes up so the tricky part for me is when patients come to me after radiation therapy because they've been given Android deprivation therapy the testosterone is 50. and their oncologist spent all this time taking away the testosterone that's right and when you get it from 50 past 250 you're going to see that rise until you hit saturation and so the oncologist says what are you doing patient says what's going on I have to set the expectation it's going to rise it's going to Plateau I just have to have the understanding with you based on the saturation model we just have to have this understanding what about testosterone and breast cancer this is a topic I have become very fascinated with um I want to do a dedicated podcast on breast cancer and all things that have to do with it because it's obviously such a comprehensive and such an important topic given you know it's it's obvious impact on on women um but while I have you here do you does does anything you do focus on from a research perspective the effects of testosterone as an adjunct to therapy especially in the estrogen sensitive breast cancers yeah so I do treat women who have a history of breast cancer uh and we can't we may treat them with testosterone it's working with the oncologist many times though I will typically use drugs that are not hormone",
