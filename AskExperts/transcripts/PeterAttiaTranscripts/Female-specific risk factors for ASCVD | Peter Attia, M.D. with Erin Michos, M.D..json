        "text": "I'm glad that we're having this discussion about lipids and women and ascvd and women because there are differences you know women are not smaller men or have unique risk factors even among traditional risk factors diabetes and smoking confer a greater relative risk in women than in men and then women have unique risk factors that we'll talk more about throughout their lifespan that men do not related to menarchy when earlier late and polycystic ovary syndrome and infertility spontaneous pregnancy loss parity adverse pregnancy outcomes like preeclampsia lack of breastfeeding and early menopause in addition you know chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus are more prevalent in women so women having these unique risk factors that are female specific or female predominant and cardiovascular disease also can be different in women which is why we need more trials in women you know women are more likely to have ischemia with non-obstructive coronary disease from coronary microbacaster function or coronary vasos spasm they're more likely to have scad spontaneous coronary artery dissection and more likely to have stress cardiomopathy than men so we really need more data about treating cardiovascular disease in women but let's talk about the life cycle that you alluded to in the beginning with your question estradiol is the predominant female sex hormone in women of reproductive age that seems to have the beneficial effects with lowering LDL and conferring some cardiovascular protective properties but I should mention there's actually three types of estrogen so estradiol which is the predominant one in women in childbearing age and this is the most potent form of estrogen so estradiol is E2 so estriol E3 is the main estrogen producer in pregnancy and then estrone E1 is the only estrogen",

        "text": "produced after menopause it's also the weakest estrogen so you know starting with puberty puberty is a process that starts in the brain so the hypothalamus in the brain suddenly begins secreting gonadotropin releasing hormone or GnRH FSH and LH levels gradually increase during puberty which stimulate the follicle maturation and estrogen production and the ovaries and also the secondary sex characteristics like breast changes and changes in body composition this gets to the point where then there's the onset of menarchy or the first Menses and so this is typically you know around age 12 and it's important to note that you know I treat adult patients but why I even ask adult women about the onset of menarchy is because both early menarchy before the age of 11 and also late menarchy after the age of 17 has been associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk later in life and there's likely hormonal and adipocine and Hearty metabolic imprinting that's related to this there's lots of factors related to the onset of menarchy but but both social economic and environmental factors as well as genetic factors but elevated BMI is a risk factor for early onset menarchy which is why again it's so important that we think about Healthy Lifestyles starting in childhood and I'll talk a little bit now about the menstrual cycle because many people don't know but the lipids do change throughout the menstrual cycle difference in little cholesterol you know as much as 10 to 12 milligrams per decilator difference and so while most women are reproductive age who have lower LDL this is not probably clinically significant in terms of athergenesis it doesn't matter when thinking about the timing of measuring a lipid panel during the menstrual cycle I think that's important to note so during the menstrual cycle you have the hypothalamus releasing GnRH which causes",

        "text": "the pituitary gland to release FSH so FSH is acting on the ovaries to mature the follicles and that the follicle also the ovaries is what secretes estradiol and so estradiol causes the maturation of the egg and the thickening of the uterus lining and preparation for a fertilized egged implant and then the increased estradiol triggers the release of LH which induces ovulation and release of the egg and so ovulation ends the follicular phase and then after ovulation you're in the gluteal phase where estradiol with progestin prepare the womb for implantation but if the egg isn't fertilized the corpus luteum which is secreting the progesterone breaks down so this leads to a drop in progesterone level in the beginning of the menstrual period what does this mean for lipids so after men sees you know total cholesterol and LDL increase rapidly after men sees and so they really Peak during this follicular phase and then this is followed by a decline in the ludial phase which corresponds to the rise in the peak concentration of estrogen and progesterone so when s your dial is the highest in the menstrual cycle this leads to the fall in total cholesterol and LDL HDL is highest around ovulation triglycerides didn't really have a consistent pattern during the menstrual cycle so there isn't specific guidance and sorry just to make sure I understood that Aaron the difference between the peak and Nader of LDL cholesterol is about 10 to 12 milligrams per deciliter or is that total cholesterol that was total cholesterol but it mirrors the difference in LDL as well so this was a study that um published on average total cholesterol may go from 158 to 168 where LDL on average went from 97 to 102. so you know they're not dramatic changes which is why we don't worry about this too much and women of reproductive ages who don't have a lipid disorder but it's you know",

        "text": "interesting to note but if a woman is very high risk like has ascbd and we're trying to Target these really intensive thresholds like ldls less than 70 or even lower it's useful to know that they do change throughout the menstrual cycle so while there's no specific guidance around this you know I generally recommend clinicians measure the lipid panel during the Menses so that it's ideally measured monitored and compared at the same time during the menstrual cycle so usually the Menses is easiest to Benchmark to we do that when we're concerned with as women become perimenopausal and we want to start getting a sense of what's Happening we always use day five so if the initiation of Menses even if it's spotting is day one but we always just pick day five and that way we have a really consistent view specifically of FSH and estradiol progesterone is zero at that time but the FSH and the estradiol really give us a sense of how close she's probably getting to menopause and then we correlate that with symptoms to sort of start to think about initiating HRT but that's a whole other topic which I'm sure we'll get to in terms of lipid panel it's good to be measuring around the same time each month so if you're following serial lipid panels and a woman for a reason so timing it around day five especially if you're measuring other hormones but yeah so FSH would be at the highest during the early follicular page and then declines after ovulation where LH is low during the early follicular phase and then Peaks around at ovulation which stimulates the egg to be released at this point in a woman's life she still enjoys this Pro intents and purposes decade advantage over men in terms of ascvd risk so a 40 year old woman who is still ovulating is at a cardiovascular standpoint as a 30 year old man is that directionally what we would say prior to menopause yeah I mean on average and again people are not",

        "text": "averages you know people are individuals but on average there is a about 10-year offset of ascbd in women developing it later than men and this may be because we'll talk about when we get to menopause you know with the loss of estradiol after menopause LDL levels rise after menopause and so that women may have higher ldls a little bit later in life you know many women's tell me oh you know I've always had good lipid levels and now they're higher you know after menopause and so when we get back to what we started with about the integration of duration of LDL exposure in terms of cholesterol years they may have had lower number of cholesterol years during their childbearing years and then higher levels later in life and that might be why they have this offset but again you don't see this in FH and we don't see this as well in diabetes and so each person is an individual and so we do women a disservice when we presume that all women somehow are lower risk or protected during their menopausal years because we started out this podcast talking about that we absolutely see myocardial events not just things like scad but we see actual atherosclerotic myocardial infarction events in younger women too so they're at lower risk but not zero risk and so we take each person as an individual and then there are things we need to consider related to contraceptions and PCOS that can also affect the lipid profile as well [Music]",
