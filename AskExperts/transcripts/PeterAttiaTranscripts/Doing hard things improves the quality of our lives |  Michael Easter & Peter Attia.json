        "text": "you don't talk about musogi publicly you can talk about it with friends with your with your wife and close ones but you don't put it on Instagram and Facebook and Twitter and the reason for that is so many times now this rule this guideline was a guideline before social media but so much stuff that people do today is often for the grant right you want to do something so you can post it and by removing this all of a sudden you have this question of if you're doing something really hard and you want to quit are you going to keep going for you knowing that it's not going to be for a pat on the back some sort of social with social implications the second guideline is that the mussogee should be somewhat quirky make something up the reason for that is because once you remove sort of artificial metrics that changes the game right if you're doing a marathon all of a sudden you're thinking about your time you're thinking about all these different things that are kind of socially constructed whereas if you just pick some random task it's like well let's just see if we can do it we have no we have no framework for this and that kind of opens up the door for some interesting experiences so some of the misogis that this guy has done is one year him and a few guys they got an 85 pound Boulder and they walked it underneath the Santa Barbara Channel I think it was five miles so one guy would dive down pick up the boulder walk 10 yards drop it go up the next guy would dive down rinse and repeat until you're at point B but there's also simpler things like here's this mountain that we see every day let's see if we can get up there in a single day things like that now the point of these there's two big reasons for doing something like this one is that it",
