        "text": "thinking plants are valuable but i i guess it seems to me that one of the core tenets of the of the diet is that plants are sort of low low grade toxic right i mean isn't that sort of part of the thesis yeah the thesis is basically everything is toxic except grass fed animal foods um so like even tap water is considered uh not optimal but um yeah so the the book spends a lot of time like going through the litany of all the potentially harmful compounds in in plant foods and actually you know what i i sympathize with some of this i think there is a bias toward thinking if it's in a plant it's healthy and i don't think that's true i think the book is right that that's not necessarily true and i think there are some plant compounds that at least for some people are not so good and you know there are well characterized examples of this like if you eat a lot of spinach you can get kidney stones from all the oxalate um there are studies suggesting that the glucosinolates in [Music] cabbage family plants might contribute to type 2 diabetes you know there's like kidney beans if you don't cook them enough they can be really toxic because the lectins so it's not like there aren't examples of this it's it's definitely true that to some degree i think it just gets taken far beyond where the evidence is and you know the way to think about how healthy a food is is not to say does it contain toxins is to say what's the cost benefit analysis on this food and most importantly what are the empirical",
