C s Yagnik and he's done incredible studies in low birth weight babies in India particularly Pune and he's found that already at a very early stage when the babies are born they're already shown fetal hyperinsulinemia their body habitus is already a small tiny fetal potbelly like visceral fat and very thin extremities when you check their skin fold you basically see that they're already have a limited subcutaneous fat when you compare them to Caucasians and so this whole concept has come up about insulin resistance is this really a response to in utero basically and then another theory that he came up with is a soldier to diplomat hypothesis which I found very interesting were initially we might look at this problem as being something that allowed us to preserve more glucose for brain function so insulin resistance really is a evolutionary adaptation that allows more glucose to be available so our brain can use it to really thrive and survive we always talk about our primitive ancestors in terms of musculature but you need to have",
