Turk Topol eric is a very famous cardiologist geneticist and digital medicine researcher / pioneer he's the founder and director of the scripps research translational institute esri and part coming to Scripps he served as the chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic a post he held for about 15 years we actually start the interview by talking about the story that led to him leaving the Cleveland Clinic and actually we spent quite a bit of time on this story which is something that I certainly remember following during its unfolding in the early part of the 2000s he's also the editor in chief of Medicaid and in 2012 he published a book called the creative destruction of medicine what we talk about today though is his I believe his third book but it could be as forth called deep medicine and this is something I've been wanting to talk with Eric about for some time because it really goes into in a non sci-fi way the application of artificial intelligence deep learning machine learning in medicine which is as you probably realize a field that is at times",

Eric Topol thanks so much for for coming over on a Friday afternoon great to be with you Peter this is kind of funny because we've both lived in San Diego for over 10 years and your name comes up all the time I have everybody says to me you must know Eric Topol and I say well of course I know of him but no I don't know him and where it really comes up is every time I'm at Dexcom uh-huh and obviously you're on the board there and I know Kevin Sayer very well and I met several folks on the team so it's hard to believe is the first time we're meeting it is I've heard a lot about you over",
