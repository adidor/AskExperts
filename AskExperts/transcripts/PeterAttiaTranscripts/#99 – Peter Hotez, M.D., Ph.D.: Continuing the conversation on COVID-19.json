Peter Hotez renowned vaccine scientist pediatrician and an expert on the current coronavirus outbreak we released an episode with Peter on March 14th which received a lot of feedback people were very grateful for that and wanted to have him back on with other questions it is difficult to immediately address questions that are posed in the aftermath of a podcast that's five days old because five days in this outbreak is an eternity so a lot of the stuff we talked about today is not actually stuff I thought I would talk about with Peter at the time that we finished our last episode and again that means it might not be germane a week from now but nevertheless this was recorded March 19th in the late afternoon evening and as such it's probably only as relevant as that timing given the temporal nature of things at this moment in time I think podcasts become pretty obsolete pretty quickly so hopefully you're all able to listen to this today March 20th or shortly thereafter moving forward I will",

Peter Hotez hey Peter thank you so much for making time again to speak I know it was less than a week ago that we sat down to do this but a week in terms of this coronavirus seems like a year with respect to the knowledge and insight that we're gaining with respect to everything else in health care I really appreciate the opportunity to be on this was our first podcast together and maybe it was the topic but the response has been extraordinary I've been getting emails and texts from people so many individuals and all of them really enthusiastic and supportive and saying that we did such a good job explaining some complicated science and and asking questions that people who actually wanted to know the answer to but maybe never articulated before and tied so many things together and connected a lot of dots and then in a few cases we've even gotten people reaching out asking if they can help to support our vaccine",
