        "text": "regarding your views on time restricted feeding so it all goes to according to plan we'll wrap all that but I think it will all kind of fit together because I think a lot of what we'll talk about in the protein time restricted feeding will play off what we learn in the dexa so with that said anything you want to add before we kind of jump into the first question nope let's uh let's go for it perfect so the first one kind of just keep it simple just how should people interpret their dexa scans so when your patients do them and you do them and you look at the results what do you care about what are you looking at and even what metrics are they providing that you don't care about well you know I think um probably first I should explain what a dexa scan is for folks so a dexoscan is is um you know it's an x-ray basically it's a sort of a moving x-ray so you lay on a table and a really really low powered x-ray so meaning very little ionizing radiation is sort of run across your body and the way all x-rays work basically is there's a plate behind the the object or the person being x-rayed and it's effectively looking at what's hitting the plate and the more dense something is in front of the plate the less electrons that are going to hit the back of the plate now there's a unit in radiation that we talk about and it's usually Millie sieverts we talk about um you know how many millisieverts of radiation something uh you know offers you and more radiation to some extent is is harmful and so the the NRC recommends that a person receive no more of 50 millisieverts in a year in calendar year now so so the question is then how do you put that in context right so so just living at sea level is something to the tune of one to two millisieverts per year so just being exposed to the Sun at sea level",

        "text": "um and and not just the Sun but of course you know everything that's ionizing um in the uh in space basically it exposes you to you know two three maybe four percent of your annual allotment and that changes so if you lived in Colorado you know where you're basically a mile above sea level it's about twice that amount that you're getting um but when you start to look at something like a flight like what is an East Coast to West Coast Flight well that's a that's you know it's a certain amount of radiation it's not nearly as much as if you're going over the polls um but now you have to measure those things in micro sieverts that's how much lower it is so a flight would be like 40 micro sieverts and again a micro sievert is one one thousandth of a millisievert um so what about a mammogram so a mammogram would be about 400 micro sieverts or 0.4 millisieverts chest x-ray depending on the size of the individual maybe 25 to 50 micro sieverts conversely a CT scan of the chest abdomen and pelvis could be up to 20 millisieverts which would be about 40 percent of your annual allotment so why am I saying all this well I just want to put dexa in context because it is a virtually radiation free technology it is insanely low it's basically anywhere um well I won't get in all the details of why but it's typically less than 20 micro sieverts that's that's sort of the punch line so adexa has no more radiation than even the lowest end of a chest x-ray and we're talking about you know gosh like 1 20th of the radiation of a mammogram and about half the radiation of a cross-country flight Okay so all that is to say the dexa is a really safe low risk uh it's it's a you know",

        "text": "there's effectively zero risk to a dexa scan um and it's not something you need to do that often like I mean we have some patients when they come into the practice they're ordering dexa scans or they've been doing dexa scans on themselves every six weeks that's a total waste of time so this is a type of scan that you would do once maybe twice per year it has the capacity to distinguish effectively three things bone fat and other those are basically the three buckets that dexa is uh distinguishing based on the density of you know what's what's being what the electrons are going through so when you do the scan you basically get four pieces of information if you're looking closely at it now again when most people go and get a dexa scan they're kind of looking at one thing which is what's my body fat um and again body fat can be calculated in two ways but the probably the best way to do it is to take the total amount of fat and divide it by the total mass of the individual and that gives you percent body fat technically you can subtract out bone mass when you do that and get tissue fat percent but and by the way that doesn't differ very much because bones don't weigh that much um but just in case you're wondering where the way that discrepancy can be so certainly body fat is a relevant consideration we'll talk about it um but I think there's three others that are more important and the first is actually bmd bone mineral density and um that is both reported in an absolute amount in grams per centimeter squared and it's also reported in a z-score now",

        "text": "I think we we've probably covered a lot of this in the previous AMA on bone health so I won't go into any more detail on that the next thing that you get is an estimate of vat or visceral adipose tissue and um again I won't go into how this is done but it is clearly just an estimate and it's based on looking at the amount of fat that is in the Torso above the anterior superior iliac crest and the ribs and kind of trying to subtract out what it believes is in the subcutaneous space and therefore looking at the difference and as you'll see visceral fat is a relatively small fraction of total body fat but it's important to get that right because it's so much more indicative of risk and the final thing that it gives you is uh sometimes it does this directly it just tells you the appendicular lean mass index and sometimes you just have to calculate it and you can always calculate the fat-free mass index what both of which we'll talk about so these are measures of how much lean mass you have or muscle mass in the extremities and the way this is always reported is total amount of lean tissue divided by height in meters squared so both appendicular lean mass index and fat-free mass index which is just total mass that is not fat divided by height in meters squared they're both reported therefore in kilograms per meter squared so those are the four things you get when you do a dexa and of course all of these things you want to see how you stack up against a population and that population is typically stratified by your sex and by your age so therefore we have nomograms for each of these things and that's how we present the data to a patient and that's how we therefore make decisions",

        "text": "about you know where you rank and what you need to do and so so to clarify on that so the bone mineral density to that and almi and ffmi those are the four major things and now I think I've heard you say before is not every place you get a dexa scan will give you those metrics but every place will provide those met will provide the metrics you need to come to the conclusion of that for yourself with one exception so there are some dexa places that only give total body z-score for bone and they don't break it out individually by hip and lumbar spine this is important because and I again I believe I spoke about this on the previous AMA you can't make a diagnosis of osteopenia or osteoporosis or frankly assess uh bmd clinically without that feature in other words if you just look at total body bmd the z-score for the total body is um it's it's too easy to mask what's going on in those areas so doesn't mean you can't get a deck set one of those places you can but you just have to understand there's a blind spot which is you're not getting adequate information about bmd so if there's any concern about bmd you're going to have to go to a place that is able to give the segmented information yeah which is good for people to know just because as they're Googling different places and calling around it gives them something specific to ask for to get a good understanding yeah so on that I think what makes sense to do next is dive into each of those four metrics a little more and kind of what they mean and why they're important um with bmd i as you mentioned we covered that in a bmd AMA which was AMA 37 for anyone who hasn't listened to it wants to go back and listen I don't think we really need to dive into that in as much detail just based on that ama but the vat almi and ffmi I think might be worth",
