        "text": "a moment ago you alluded to a statistic that uh i think for many people is just almost impossible to fathom which is the united states has just for the first time ever surpassed uh a 100 000 person mortality uh for a 12-month period so a hundred thousand people have overdosed in the united states for the first time in 12 months do you see this as an epidemic of trauma and shame or do you see this as really just a new um escape valve for it based on the availability of cheap and unfortunately highly potent opioids yeah i think it's a combination of both and i think the data tells us that that more and more people are feeling desperate and disenfranchised right or feeling like look i can't make my way in the world right whatever my chosen route of endeavor is i can't make a living in that right i can't support a family in that i can't get ahead i can't feel good about myself right and we see that in aspects like almost the entire service industry right which is which has changed into a place where people can't have careers that then support their lives and support a family like was the case even 20 20 something years ago right we see that even people who have good jobs right who feel like okay i finally got my wife i worked hard enough i have a good job that often that job is running them ragged in a way that they can't take care of themselves and they can't take care of their families and they feel the same desperation as a person who doesn't have a job right and this desperation builds anger and frustration and resentment and all these other symptoms depression and panic that spin off of it right and that makes it much more appealing to soothe in the short term like that's a basic psychological fact of human beings right the more pain you're in in the short term the more",
