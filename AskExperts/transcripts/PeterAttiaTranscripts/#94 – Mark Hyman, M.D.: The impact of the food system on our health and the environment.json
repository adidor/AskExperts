Mark Hyman mark is a family physician a New York Times best selling author and the director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for functional medicine it turns out we're going to talk about pretty much none of that today we talk almost exclusively on his new book which is due out tomorrow called food fix how to save our health our economy our communities and our planet one bite at a time and if that sounds like a mouthful it's because it is a mouthful this is a kind of staggering topic and even by the standards of this podcast it's probably too much for one episode mark basically lays out a thesis that if you fix the food system you fix a lot of problems so it's not a one for it's not a twofer it's like somewhere between a 3 4 and a 4 4 we don't spend a lot of time talking about the health consequences of fixing food although we open our discussion with that talking about the health impact of food we talked a little bit about gut health but we spend more of our time probably speaking about some of the social consequences and the environmental consequences and of course it ultimately does come down to health",
