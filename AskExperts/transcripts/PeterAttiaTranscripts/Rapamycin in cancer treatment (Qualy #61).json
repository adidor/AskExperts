        "text": "times higher than what they originally tested the females still live a little bit longer but the difference between males and females the gap has closed quite a bit so I think that females for whatever reason at a given concentration of rapamycin are just more affected by that amount of the drug and I think what we did in our high dose study is we just pushed it a little too far we pushed it to the point where rapamycin did something probably to the immune system that that allowed these immune cancers to to escape surveillance or become hyper proliferative and again I'm not I'm not a cancer biologist I'm not an immunologist so I don't I don't have a good feel for what the mechanism is I can tell you what the observation is and that's that all of those animals had aggressive hamada planet cancers when they got this 3 months of rapamycin just out of curiosity more B cellar t-cell do you recall I don't recall it's in the paper we can look it up because there's an opportunity here to do the reverse there's an opportunity to take right now we're seeing just an unbelievable amount of activity and adoptive cell therapy and or even when you just talk about like checkpoint inhibitors and things like that like it makes you wonder are there ways to make these things better maybe the checkpoints the wrong example because you might get more autoimmunity but but certainly you talk about adoptive cell therapy anything that could boost either you know cd8 function or inhibit the regs or something there might be ways I can almost makes you wonder if using rapamycin in a different manner in combination with immune based therapy that might make more sense ya know I think there's a lot that could be done there for sure part of the reason why we haven't explored this in more detail one reason is again as I said I'm not a cancer biologist so it's not that's not the thing I'm most interested and I think it's really interesting",

        "text": "biology but it's not the thing I'm most interested in but I also feel like because the dose that we gave was so high that again thinking translationally about rapamycin as a drug in the context of aging my feeling is that what we've uncovered here is not going to be relevant at the doses that we would think about giving - yes yes so that's why I haven't really spent a lot of my time trying to figure out what's going on there but I think certainly in the context of cancer immune therapies I think we do need to think a little bit more about how effective those kinds of therapies are going to be in the elderly and maybe something like rapamycin could help could actually enhance the ability of those there I mean this question you posed when when David Sabatini Tim Ferriss and knavish endo and I were an Easter Island a year ago over a year ago this might have been our favorite mealtime discussion which is what best explains the increase in cancer incidence with age being in other words what the primary driver be the reduction in immune surveillance or the length of time to accumulate mutations or the frequency of mutations like I mean yeah it's not an obvious answer and I don't think it has to be just one no exactly I think all this yeah yeah I certainly over the last few years have come to think that the decline in immune function is it's certainly more important than I had initially that that's my I mean I secretly want that to be the biggest driver because I think we have a better chance to control that yeah then some of the other ones and I think it probably is that would be my guess and I also think it kind of makes sense that if you have an immune system that's functioning the way it's supposed to you can actually deal with the mutation accumulation because your immune system is going to clear those mm-hmm before they become yeah problems",
