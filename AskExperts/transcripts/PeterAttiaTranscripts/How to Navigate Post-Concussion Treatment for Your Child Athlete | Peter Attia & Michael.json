        "text": "that's that that's my point is like without someone in the ER who's going to do the real oculomotor test or whatever I I can speak to the symptoms but I can't speak to the signs on my own correct yeah and it's even hard to speak to the symptoms you know but dizziness fogginess fatigue light sensitive noise sensitivity headache obviously difficulties falling or staying asleep nausea car sickness difficulty in busy environments cognitive issues you know all those things can you know I mean but as long if you don't have any of those problems and no live your life man it's it's okay you know but it can be subtle that's for sure but it's not gonna bite you Peter you know it's not like I don't wanna like it's something where if your symptoms are are pretty nasty and they're not getting better yeah you better see someone right I mean you want to get in the sooner you get in the better it's going to be if the symptoms are very subtle and improving I'm not that worried about it honestly you just don't want another head injury while that's going on and so that may be a reason if you're a weekend warrior you're going to pick up basketball game you want to play in the next weekend you probably want to get it checked out to make sure this everything's normal if you're not a weekend warrior you're not going to hit your head again and it's getting better I'm not necess so sure you need to see someone [Music]",
