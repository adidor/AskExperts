Smith might not have as much time as dr. Isaacson to sit down and spend an hour with each patient going over this stuff but I can at least point a patient to a tool that can help streamline this process when I'm sleeping without an EPR or without any or anything just guess the way the internet works when I go to sleep and wake up my ex-girlfriend with the phone the phone thing I was trying to show off and impress she said well you work so much and every time you give a lecture okay fine but make money while you're sleeping well it's the same thing I want to help people and educate people I'm sleeping you're right I see seven patients in a day sometimes five because it takes a lot of time but when I'm sleeping over a thousand patients are on that free education website with two hours of interactive educational content about Alzheimer's prevention that's how we impact live so I'm hoping that we can increase that from a thousand to eighty six hundred patients while you're sleeping I would reference 'nor will get the reference to that so does my",
