        "text": "so again I'm curious as to how that experience compared to the passing of retreats he has done where he is not fasted and two experiences where he's fasted and not done the meditative retreat I also wonder how much of a common element or elements are consistent between the experience I had with sleep and this state that you're describing because I again that that whole sleep thing has really made me question this you know addiction I have to the societal norm of making dinner the social meal you know and I if you look at Sachin pandas work and we were all laboratory animals we really ought to be eating first thing in the morning and then tapering off later in the day if we're really gonna follow both our circadian rhythm but also optimize around glucose disposal and insulin sensitivity so why don't we do that right or why don't I do that why do I generally not eat in the morning and then back load it and it's all social right it's like I'm not gonna have breakfast with everybody but I'm gonna have dinner with everybody but of course I have to wonder how much of that experience due to the not the ketones because I don't I don't think it was just the ketones because I had this experience even on the first night when my ketones were probably like one one-and-a-half millimolar which is very easy to attain during nutrition nutritional ketosis but it was some combination of the ketones and or the complete and utter lack of digestive process and that's made me think maybe I should just be getting up eating the biggest breakfast in the world and then not eat the rest of the day could I pull that off and I just I've been too lazy to try frankly but that sleep like that  was awesome like I I want that I want that every goddamn night because like you could do anything I feel like there's no end to the type of regeneration you could have",
