        "text": "is there any clear evolutionary explanation for why different eye colors have emerged why why is what you know what's the advantage of brown iris versus blue yeah it's a protection from uv light and from from visible light in the same way the different skin tones have emerged so typically you see dark-eyed people closer closer clustered closer to the equator because you know the visible light and uv light and infrared light or infrared radiation are really destructive and as you might remember this is one of the few things that people remember from medical school about the retina but it's one of the most metabolically active tissues in the body if not the most metabolically active tissue and because it's constantly being bombarded with radiation effectively it's prone to free radical formation so the what's called the retinal pigment epithelium which is the pigmented layer behind the retina underneath the retina that is responsible from for shielding the vascular supply behind the retina from all of this radiation because that that vascular network behind the retina has a very high oxygen tension and it would be prone to pre free radical formation if it were constantly being bombarded by uv light infrared radiation visible light and that's why you see in people near the equator more pigment and that's also true of the iris as well this podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine nursing or other professional health care services including the giving of medical advice",
