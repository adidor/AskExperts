Stanley [Music] Stanley thank you so much for making time to talk today I've wanted to speak with you for a couple of months now and I know it when we first connected it was just nuts and you said hey Peter thanks for reaching out can we talk when things calm down a little bit and I was so gracious that first of all that you even took the time to respond and then of course now we've been able to work together on a separate project that maybe we'll talk about down the line but I'll tell you the reason I reached out in the first place was really the result of something that my research team came to me and said which was look Peter if you want to understand coronaviruses you've got to speak to Stanley Perlman everybody is a armchair coronavirus expert now but you actually want to talk to the guy who was studying coronaviruses before they were sexy and that Stanley so before we get maybe into",
