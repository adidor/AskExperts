        "text": "below average but that is definitely a step up from low in in terms of how they categorize these that's right um if you then go from low to above average it's about a 60 or 70 percent reduction in mortality and it just continues monotonically to increase again the lowest improvement is going from high to elite that doesn't buy you a whole heck of a lot it is still statistically significant and that's to see that you have to look at um figure c again this is going to be one of those podcasts where it's really going to be better to watch this over video um because you know the data just speak for themselves and of course the show notes are going to include all of these so make sure you're looking at this but remember the hazard ratio for mortality is the reciprocal of the hazard ratio of risk reduction so a tables a and c are basically showing you similar things in the group comparison so again when i said that going from high to elite didn't have as much of a benefit you can see it has the smallest hazard ratio of um improvement in benefit or the reduction going from elite to to sorry you're going from high to elite it's 29 but notice that the confidence interval does not cross one and therefore the p-value is less than 0.05 now here's what's interesting what they've done and you can see all of these listed right so if you compare someone of low fitness to elite it is a five-fold difference in mortality over a decade which is pretty remarkable and that's what they show you above they give you context they put this in the context of other things that we commonly understand as being problematic for",
