        "text": "one of the questions i i love asking my patients is how many of your great grandparents can you name most people can't tell me a thing about one i can't i i didn't even meet two of my grandparents but these centenarians have a gift when you can go to concerts with your great grandchildren that's amazing when you could take a vacation with your great grandchild their superpower is simply delaying the onset of bad things so it's not that they don't get heart attacks they just don't get them when they're 65. it's not that they don't get cancer they just don't get it when they're 60. to me the takeaway for us as physicians or people who want to have an extra five years of life or 10 years of life even if we can't have an extra 20 is nothing matters more than prevention of chronic disease and by the way you don't get to prevent it once you have your heart attack secondary prevention is not prevention",
