        "text": "so um [Music] variation between individuals and body mass index about 75 percent of those differences between people is explained by their genetics that's what that implies and um if we look at other methods that have tried to figure out what are the genes that underlie this what are the genetic differences these are the genome-wide association studies that i think are particularly informative in this regard they simply ask the question if we look at the entire genome and we look at these representative genetic markers where different people have different genetic code called snips single nucleotide polymorphisms where in the genome what markers correlate with differences in body mass index fortunately body mass index is really easy to measure so you can get really big sample sizes in these studies which you need to get statistically significant results because you're looking at i think like millions i don't remember exactly how many but you're looking at a lot of genomic markers so you need tremendous statistical power to detect anything with with a high level of confidence so you have these studies i think the latest is like 800 000 people um the leader of the pack is is the height genome-wide association study i think they have like three million and now they've saturated the heritability they've gotten all the information they can with that sample size out of what the common genetic variants are that correlate with differences in height so i think with body mass index we may in the near future we may saturate it as",

        "text": "well we may know what are all the common genetic differences that correlate with differences in in body mass index so um essentially so far these studies have identified i think like 900 variants that differ so what this suggests is that differences in body mass index between individuals are very complex that genetically very complex they're determined by a lot of different genes with very small effect sizes so you get this sorting of all these different genes and whatever combination you get lucky or unlucky determines whether you're to a large degree determines whether you are susceptible or not susceptible to obesity in a in a fattening environment is the way i would put it and um so they have various ways of looking at what these genes are doing because you know that's one way you can use these genome-wide association studies that's particularly informative you could say what's the underlying biology that makes some people fatter and some people slimmer and i want to talk a little bit about why this is such an important approach one is that you're looking people so you're looking at people in their regular everyday context this is not an artificial lab scenario you're just looking at people living their lives and experiencing higher or lower weight and you're saying what genes correlate with that so it's very naturalistic second it's very replicable these studies are",

        "text": "highly replicable in other words if you do three studies of this nature you're going to tend to get similar results so the methodology it's one of the most rigorous i would say in the biological sciences that we have and then i think that sorry i'll let you finish because i was going to add something to that but go ahead um and the third one is that it's unusually objective as well it has a higher level of built-in objectivity resistance to bias compared to other types of investigation because it's not hypothesis driven you're just looking across the whole genome and seeing what pops up you're not saying i'm going to focus on the connection between x biological process and y outcome you're just saying i'm interested in y outcome what correlates with it and let's see what biology pops up could be anything we're just gonna see and so that really gives you a chance to i think check your thinking on what the underlying biology is in various traits and diseases yeah and i think i think part of that comes from the strength of what ultimately makes genetic analyses like mendelian randomization so powerful is the genes are randomly distributed so that's what cleans out some of those biases is when you are looking at a million people for for whom the genes are randomly spread across them and you take an unbiased view of the sample and then you get those results over and over and over again i think it becomes very powerful and and look you know if people are listening to us saying god what are these guys talking about i mean",

        "text": "i think it's just important to understand the big picture here the big picture here is a thousand years ago a thousand years ago to all intents and purposes none of us were obese but that still means directionally 50 of us at least had the genes that would allow us to become obese in an obesogenic environment that's really all that's that's really what we're explaining here is that there are a highly highly heritable set of genes that will allow a subset of the population and actually one of the things i'm just curious about your thoughts arteleologically why is it 50 why isn't it 100 right like why is it that more people don't have that was this just a fluke of evolution was this you know you would you would almost think that evolution would have wanted everybody to have those genes [Music]",
