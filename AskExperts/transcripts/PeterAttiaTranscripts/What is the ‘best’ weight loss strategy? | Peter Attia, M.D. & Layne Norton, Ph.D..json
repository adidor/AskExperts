        "text": "pretty sure we do agree but let's go with that threat and then i'm going to come back to the jugular question around that very simple you have to have some form of restriction but you should pick the form of restriction that feels least restrictive to you as an individual and this is where people get really crossed up and i'll give you an example people find will find that form of restriction that felt really unrestrictive to them and you hear it all the times i tried intermittent fasting it felt like i wasn't even dieting i lost 50 pounds and it wasn't even hard then they will assume that this is the right one that this is the right approach for everyone because it was the right approach for them and we tend to retroactively then try to justify why physiologically that also is the best approach and this is why you hear people make kind of crazy claims about whether it's low carb or intermittent fasting or any one of these diets which are all excellent tools you know people think that i don't like ketogenic diets or that i don't like intermittent fasting or anything like that and that's not true i just am not a fan of insane claims about those particular diets and i think part of the problem is people will say something like well i wanna i tried restricting calories that didn't work i went on a ketogenic diet and i was eating more and lost weight you probably felt like you were eating more but unless you were weighing out again you were weighing out and the other thing that we should talk about is when you go to a ketogenic diet where you have really you know limited food choices there's not a whole lot of options for snacking like there's not really like you're mostly eating kind of like defined meal foods right",
