Alan Bauman a hair transplant surgeon who is one of the few people who is actually board-certified in hair transplantation there are lots of hair transplant surgeons out there but Alan is one of the very few who's actually board-certified and I've got no Alan very well because one of my patients actually two of my patients went to him for procedures a couple of years ago I was sort of blown away by the results because the best hair transplants are the ones where after the fact you have no clue that the patient had a hair transplant got to know him better and was impressed immediately by how open he was to all of my questions and believe me there were a lot of questions before I refer one of my patients to another physician especially a physician who's going to do a procedure on them I want to be able to vet the heck out of them and I want to understand how they're doing what they're doing and internally we put together summaries of the stuff that we learned and Alan was so gracious in his ability to share his data share his insights acknowledge what he didn't know that over the past couple of years I've sent more and more patients to him who have inquired about both surgical and non-surgical solutions to hair loss and this is of course true for both men and women so at some point I said Alan we need to sit down and talk about this and Alan is of course one of the experts in the world on this topic he's treated over 20,000 patients he's done over 8,000 hair transplants the thing about",

        "text": "has a lot to do with where those follicles come from well one of our more prominent researchers and colleagues in the field took a hair follicle from one place on his body and put it into another place and then move that follicle someplace else and track those lengths of time that it's spent in the growing phase it tracked the antigen the low of the growth phase and so what you would expect initially is that wherever you took it from like let's say the chest it grew for an inch and that's it you put it in the back of your arm should grow or back of your hand it should grow for an inch well it didn't it grew differently in those different locations so there is some local effect so what we do say and especially true for women where sometimes they can have a more a diffuse hair loss problem right because maybe not necessarily all androgen independent that we say that those hairs are relatively permanent assuming they're ever done the experiment where you take a hair and implant it in an area that has zero hair like the palm or of course yes in fact they did that for someone have you ever heard of nulls from YouTube No so nulls from YouTube is a prankster I'm sure he wouldn't be upset with me sharing with you and your listeners that he had some hair follicles implanted into the palm of his hand during his last hair transplant procedure and it grew fine Wow so that is from a just from a pure biology standpoint that is really amazing no it's not because listen the hair follicle is an organ it's a self determining organ if you have a scar which doesn't make any hair on its own you can cut that scar it's gonna bleed right you throw a hair follicle in there it will survive it will grow it will thrive well there must be something very unique about parts of our body that don't grow any hair that I don't know I guess I mean I look I don't think about",
