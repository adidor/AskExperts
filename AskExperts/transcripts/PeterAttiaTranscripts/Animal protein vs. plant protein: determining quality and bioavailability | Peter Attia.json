        "text": "still muscle protein and how do we think objectively about the quality of a protein this is a topic that uh you you've you've talked about extensively but but and there's a there's a there's a way there's a numerical way to talk about that isn't there an efficiency of of that protein versus you know tofu versus you know soybean versus rice you know that all the way down to sort of lower and lower protein density Foods yeah printing quality is something that I think a lot about and I'm actually working with a group now to sort of reinvent how we think about that but I think you're referring to printing quality in a sense of PD casts or Diaz or something like that basically we realize that when you look at a protein there are two there are two factors one is what's the composition of the those nine essential amino acids and the other is what's its bioavailability how well do we digest it and absorb it um with animal proteins and most isolated proteins you know even soy protein isolates uh the digestion absorption is pretty close to 100 it's usually 95 or higher uh for all animal proteins for plant proteins though it gets into uh you need to realize that in a plant the the protein is there for the purpose of the plant and so a lot of it is attached to fibers to structures you know we have but plants have proteins attached to the leaves and the stems and The Roots and the flowers and and uh the seeds and you know when you start to isolate that uh if you just eat it in a raw form uh it may only be 60 70 available uh because we can't digest the fiber so those are the two factors we can put those two together and get a protein quality score and we can determine that a whey protein isolate because of its essential amino acids is 20 percent better than a soy protein isolate just because of the amino acids or we can",
