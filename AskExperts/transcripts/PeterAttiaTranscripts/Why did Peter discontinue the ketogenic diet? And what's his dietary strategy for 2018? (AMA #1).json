        "text": "last week and we were talking about this that I really regret not taking muscle biopsies throughout that three year journey I think that could have been quite insightful but I also know having now put people on ketogenic diets and been around a lot of you know people on key gendai said I was about as good a responder as you're gonna see and there are others that have respond as well as me but but there are lots people who don't respond this well and so you know going back to the previous question I think that's where you have to have a little bit of humility which is like you know no offense to the keto community out there who I'm probably pissing off at the moment but I'm highly put off by the this view that like ketosis is for everybody and if you know if you try a ketogenic diet and it doesn't work for you well you screwed it up or something and it's just like that just strikes me as patently false so anyway that's I don't know if I answered the question was the question what okay and then the other question is what do I do now now I'm mostly vacillate between time restricted feeding and non time restricted feeding with a much simpler set of principles on how I eat which is just try not to eat junk so I don't really restrict my carbohydrates deliberately at all anymore which I know is gonna sound crazy to people listening to this but I just restrict bad carbohydrates yeah there's a general rule if it comes in a package it shouldn't be eaten so like the Whedon's like there's no rule for we thins in the diet all right grams there's a reasons tree somewhere Paleo ancestors were you there were you there are you sure there wasn't a tree you you know it's a very good point I wasn't there it's quite possible that we then's grew on trees with graham crackers my favorite might go to starches you know I definitely like",
