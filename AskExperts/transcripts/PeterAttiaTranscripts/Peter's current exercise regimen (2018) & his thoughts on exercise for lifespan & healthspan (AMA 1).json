        "text": "miles and then the run is 26.2 looking at exercise in general a lot of people ask what's the best exercise for longevity what is the best exercise to improve muscle mass and can you expand on lifting weights your entire life is something you should never stop doing so exercise for longevity exercise to improve muscle mass and expand on lifting weights I think the exercise for longevity is a hard question because I don't think we really know the answer so instead it's probably easier to bifurcate it into two questions which is exercise to improve lifespan and exercise to improve health span so how does exercise improve lifespan well it would have to somehow positively contribute to the delay of or to delaying the onset of atherosclerosis cancer neurodegenerative disease I think there's plenty of evidence that suggests that exercise is beneficial in all of those arenas and I think the question is through what mechanisms so that you could then go from saying exercise to understanding specifically what it could be so you know cognitively we probably see some benefit from a certain subset of hormones right that basically you know does BDNF for example increase with exercise and what is the impact that that's going to have on brain health on the cardiovascular front and also on the cancer front my guess and I think this is true on the dementia front I think that anything that exercise does that helps you dispose of glucose more efficiently and helps your muscles become better sinks for glucose is probably going to improve things so I think taking that off the table because I think that's sort of the one given the question is are there benefits on the cardiovascular system specifically from exercise that go beyond that and I think the answer is probably yes like everything there's a dose you can also probably exercise too much and it's",
