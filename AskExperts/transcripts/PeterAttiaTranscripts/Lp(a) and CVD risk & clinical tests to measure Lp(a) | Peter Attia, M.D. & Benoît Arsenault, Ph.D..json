        "text": "most i mean over the past decade i've seen three different types of commercial assays for measuring lp little a i don't believe two of them are in existence anymore one was the lp little a cholesterol content so i assume that this was an assay that was looking at the cholesterol content of the lp little a's which means the ldls that had apolipoprotein little a on them you just measure the cholesterol content so it was analogous to measuring ldl cholesterol but for this narrow subset is that essay still in existence uh well i think there are certain labs that that still use it but it's really not the way that the the field is moving to because the cholesterol and you can make the same uh the same argument for ldl the cholesterol within a certain lipoprotein uh does not necessarily tell you a lot of information about the number of particles that are in the bloodstream which is the most important thing if you to measure if you want to estimate risk so for for ldl april b there's some discordance uh but for lpa the discordance is even higher exactly so uh so so what you really want to do is uh try to find a lab that will give you an an lpa measurement in in nanomoles per liter right now there are some labs that have done that i i've seen a lot of those labs so one of them was called um god health diagnostics labs i think that was the name of the lab they no longer exist they did calculate an lp little a in nanomole per liter i don't know what their methodology was most labs are using milligrams per deciliter so they are simply telling you i say simply they are telling you the mass of",

        "text": "lp little a now just to be clear are we in that assay looking at the mass of the entire lp little a are they just trying to estimate the mass of the apolipoprotein little a's it's the mass of the particles so so it's a much better measurement than lpa cholesterol that you that you just referred to so uh and and we shouldn't you know let a good be the enemy of perfect here if you have an lpa measurement in milligrams per deciliter and it puts you in a high risk range so let's say you're you're it it gives you an lpa level of above 50 then the chances of the lpa assay that's that will give you a result in in nano moles per liter it will also give you a high a high level so if you have a an lpa measured in milligrams per deciliter you can obviously try to get a second measurement in in nanomoles per liter but you know if you have a healthy lpa in a high range ill both methods will give you uh the the the same information that you have an lpa in the in the higher range now you have to keep in mind though that if you have an lpa for instance of 50 milligrams per deciliter the measurement in nanomoles per liter will be around 125 nanomoles per liter so some some people have measurements using both methods and they just say well for some reason my lpa doubled well that's not the case the lpa didn't double and it's remarkably stable uh over time so most guidelines will probably tell you just to measure lpa once in a lifetime and it's relatively relatively stable yeah i mean i think that's the take-home point here is unlike ldl and apob which are so modifiable",
