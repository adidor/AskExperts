I just recognize that they are discrete lines exactly okay beautifully put um so most people with 2020-ish Vision or with corrective lenses or with Lasik can see 60 cycles per degree some people are better fighter pilots Etc some people someone might be 65 yeah whatever exactly a raptor bird of the sort that I saw this morning here in Texas um like a red tail hawk or red-shouldered Hawk Sees at 120 cycles per degree so that means they can sit up on a light pole and look down at the ground and see a a small gopher raise its head in the ground and it will look like they'll perceive it they might not be able to count the whiskers on that gopher's face but they'll be able to perceive that",
