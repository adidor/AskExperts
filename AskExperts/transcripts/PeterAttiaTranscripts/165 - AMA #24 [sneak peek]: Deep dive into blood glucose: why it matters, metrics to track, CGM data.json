        "text": "life for example i see this in a couple of my patients including a patient who's recovering from prostate cancer who still has some gi bleeding issues patients with gastritis etc women with a heavy menstrual period so people who are losing significant amounts of blood have a higher turnover red blood cells they're going to have an artificially low hemoglobin a1c conversely people who have red blood cells that stick around a very long time people with a microcytic pattern meaning they have very small red blood cells that are less likely to get chewed up in the splenic system which is where we ultimately um kind of break down red blood cells they're going to have an artificially elevated hemoglobin a1c because their red blood cells are living longer on average than um the than the typical person which is about 90 days so that's one reason why i'm not a huge fan of hemoglobin a1c but the broader point here is that i find it unhelpful to simply say if your hemoglobin a1c is above 6.5 and you have type 2 diabetes you have quote-unquote disease if it is below 6.5 you are normal or even if we go one step further and say well there's a pre-diabetes which is defined as 5.7 to 6.4 and those people you know we have to watch out for but anybody at 5.6 and down is completely normal as though there's some enormous difference between 5.6 and 5.7 or 6.4 and 6.5 so while on the one hand i understand the need to simplify things i think oversimplification is erroneous and i think we should view these as a continuum right so glucose at the average level",
