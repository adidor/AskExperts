        "text": "right that that there are traumas that are chronic so you think of the the trauma of neglect right there's the neglect of a child is not defined by an acute incident right it's defined by the impact upon that child of the neglect over time right the same thing with with the aspect for example of systemic racism right of of a person who gets messages over time that they're less than right that they look different they dress different they worship different whatever is going on in them is less than and that's inculcated into the person over time and that can have exactly the same effects on the brain and the same is true with vicarious trauma i mean we are fortunate of course as a species that we can be empathic with one another right we can experience the emotions of another person right in a way that's connected as if they're our own right but the other side of that coin is we can be traumatized by what happens to other people right and sometimes that might be someone we're very close to right or it might be a person who just develops such a strong interest because they're sort of horrified by things they see going on around the world and then are paying very very close attention in a way that overwhelms that person's brain's ability to cope with with that and then you know for example a a person who was so deeply impacted by the crisis in syria right that then develops post-trauma symptoms right and that person like never left their home in the united states but was so appalled and so distraught by what was going on and and didn't know to like divert their attention there was too much attention to something coming from a good place in their heart but that ultimately leaves that person manifesting the same post-trauma signs and symptoms as people who suffer",
