        "text": "are there any other specific differences in sort of male and female training that we could shed light on yeah so I think you know outside like the specificity of like putting together an actual program and targeting certain muscles muscle groups rather um people may have actually heard somewhere along their fitness journey that women tend to do better with higher rep ranges and males do better with lower rep ranges and traditionally I think there's a there's a reason why we tend to see that that style of programming um you know more prominent you know in the gym scene and part of that is due to I guess some of the differences in sex hormones um and that kind of has an impact on our muscle fiber type so females actually have a greater percentage of type 1 muscle fibers than do males and the positive consequence of that um difference there for females is that it means that we're better able to transport nutrients into the tissues and also clear different metabolites um you know during activities so the benefit there is that women tend to be less fatigable um when it comes to training and another thing that kind of coincides really nicely with that is that women um again in either both the fed and the fasted State tend to do better at utilizing um fatty acids so again it means that we're less Reliant upon some of those glycolytic um you know Pathways or anaerobic processes so um we do better um in as when it comes to recovery from different types of training so when it comes to building out that training program again I'm being pretty meticulous here but men I would often opt for a little bit more strength specific training",

        "text": "um and I guess if you look at the definitions of strength training it's the rep ranges between one to six um then you've got your moderate rep ranges or we call that the hypertrophy rep range I'll have more of that with females and then which is about eight to twelve eight to twelve eight to Fifteen and then we've got our endurance strength training which is you know your 15 to 20 reps so some like women will say that they enjoy that type of training and they're able to tolerate it better um more so than some of the strength based training but I would I would still argue that females when you're you know put in the right hands with a good qualified coach um that they could equally enjoy that style of training too but again that's thinking about like the actual differences you know that muscle fiber type and part of that's due to I believe it's estrogen you know women having a higher level of estrogen we've got more estrogen receptors I believe on our skeletal tissues and that's one of the benefits um for you know the nutrient transport so oh that's interesting wouldn't that also suggest that women would have an easier time training without ingestion of glucose right um at least in theory and yet I feel like maybe it's just looking at my wife she does not like to train on an empty stomach she she needs something to you know she needs to be drinking or eating something beforehand yeah I think but I think you mentioned you like to train on an empty stomach I'm the opposite so again I think it's really subjective um we can the science can always say certain things but we've also then got to take into the into account I think the individual's you know perception and often it's you know it is very",
