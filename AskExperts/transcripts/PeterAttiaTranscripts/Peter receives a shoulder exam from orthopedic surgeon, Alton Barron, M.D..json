        "text": "so as we were talking about a minute ago about uh the shoulder I think that with a good history interactive history and certain questions and a good physical exam I can be about 95 accurate in making a diagnosis without an MRI without a CT scan without even X-rays and so I think that conserves resources and also it just gets the information because those little tidbits are what are critical including to knowing what's going to make you the best whether it's going to be an injection PT surgery maybe Etc so the first thing I look at is you know it's nice that you're fit so I can see any true abnormalities I can look for atrophy I can look for asymmetry somebody who's had a shoulder separated shoulder will have a big bump on one side yours are equal I can look at the pecs and see you know some of the nerve problems we talked about the parsonage Turner for instance the mixed brachial plexopath the LC someone with a very indented pectoralis at a patient the other day who's is a rock and roll guitarist and he was lifting weights and and ruptured his pectoralis tendon and so I could look and see right away he had bruising down the arm not the chest wall that means he tore the tendon from the bone here instead of the muscle tendon unit here which a lot of weight lifters would will tear but I could also see gross asymmetry so those are the kind of things you're looking for and I also even care about the sloping of the shoulders because that can potentially be posturally if it's an issue with posture and so forth okay so looking at your shoulder I see nothing asymmetric I I just then so I'm looking at the asymmetry I haven't checked motion yet I'm just going to palpate so I can palpate the AC joint and see that those are tender or non-tender I can palpate the front of the shoulder now this area is always tender it's where the brachial plexus of passing through",
