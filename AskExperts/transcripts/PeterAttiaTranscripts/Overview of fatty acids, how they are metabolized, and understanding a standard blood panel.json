        "text": "i'm sure i wanna start by talking about saturated fatty acids in general okay and what we know is that going back here to the basics and looking at the liver when we have incorporation of saturated fatty acids into our triglycerides okay that is correlated with insulin resistance and adiposity okay likely reflecting accelerated hepatic denovo lipogenesis okay or also it can be what is actually returned to the liver so really too we certainly know that hepatic de novo lipogenesis is a big part of the problem when it comes to elevated triglycerides but we can also make these with some what is delivered exactly back to the liver and so when we see saturated fatty acids okay as a makeup of triglycerides or maybe even the phospholipids there we say oh my goodness that's a marker of increased saturated fatty acid consumption right these people are eating a high saturated fat diet and that seems to make sense and this is the problem with a lot of things in science in general but and nutrition science is no different is that just because it seems to make sense doesn't mean it's the way things actually work okay sarah can i can i explain a technical point on this slide that you and i will take for granted but i want to make sure that a listener understands absolutely please do so when when a patient goes and gets their blood drawn let's just say they get a standard lipid panel it will spit out the following values total cholesterol",
