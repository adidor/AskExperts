        "text": "E3 among estrone types I apologize I don't know that data except that it's no worries okay it's a very weak type of estrogen and so essentially you know women after menopause really have very low levels of estrogen in fact women have low after menopause have lower levels of estrogen than men do men have higher estrogen levels because of they have much higher testosterone levels and they have increased peripheral conversion of testosterone estradiols actually men have higher estradiol levels than women after menopause do you know my other favorite stat that's a great one by the way the other favorite stat of mine is that even pre-menopause women have higher testosterone than estrogen if you actually convert the units to the same units I think some people think after menopause the ovaries are just not active anymore but that's not true actually after menopause the ovaries continue to just don't make us turnile but they continue to produce endorsedinone and testosterone so they keep making androgens really up to significant amounts until age 80. and these androgens are what get converted in fat muscle tissue into estrone so I mentioned this because a lot of my research has been about sex hormone levels after menopause and we've previously shown that post-menopausal women who have higher Androgen levels who have higher testosterone to estrogen ratios you know had a more male-like pattern you know they had greater risk of developing asebd and heart failure over the next 12 years and this was even after we adjusted for risk factors like blood pressure lipids and diabetes and we did a number of studies as well in the Mesa study the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis but we also showed that women with higher androgens had more coronary artery calcium progression they had worse and endothelial reactivity",
