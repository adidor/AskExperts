        "text": "some Dynamic tests so first thing I'll have someone do is to lift up the one of the legs usually I'll do if if the person is complaining of right hip pain I'll have them stand on the other side so that I want to see what they can do with their quote-unquote normal side so first thing I want you to do is just stand on one leg on the left side and try to hold balance and you hold it there to see if that if there's any swaying from side to side how much their body shifts over that side or if they're having trouble balancing and then I have them do the opposite side as well what we're looking for here is to see if the pelvis tilts also if the pelvis tilts during this maneuver it may mean that the hip abductors particularly the gluteus medius may be either injured it could be torn or it could be weak or it could be a neurologic problem where the muscle is not firing you could stand up straight then I have someone do a two-legged squat and come back up with what do they do with their hands so I don't have them do anything with the hands I want to see what they do first I want to see how they're used to doing it sometimes I'll change that up for example and how do you want their feet do you want this to be a narrow squat or wide squat I asked them I first I let them do what they want to do I want to see what's comfortable for them and how they're normally squatting some people keep their foot feet you know outwards some people go really close and some people put their arms up some people put it on their chest so I just want to see what their what their their normal is what's comfortable for them some people don't do squats regularly so they're not really interested in form and to be honest I'm not really interested in form either for this particular part I just want to see how",

        "text": "their body's reacting to that movement I guess in that if you just said squat in the easiest way you could if you had to spend a day down here what would you how would you do it it would probably be at this angle right right and most people can't stick do that either and the other thing I'm I'm looking for is come back up is some people will put their arms straight up in the air when they Squat and that tilts their pelvis and so sometimes it's easier to do that because they're because it what it does is it it accentuates the lordosis of the spine which tilts the pelvis forward and that will affect the hip flexors so if they do that first I'll have them change to bring their arms down try to make their back a little flatter and do the same squat to see if there's any change in the motion at the hip okay um the next thing I do so then I get a good sense of their balance I get a good sense of their hip musculature and then I want to check their their natural connective tissue so some people have connective tissue disease we have something called the baiting score where we get a sense of if someone has loose ligaments ehlers-danlos would be an example of a connective tissue disorder that I want to know about because that may mean they have specific injuries so it's a basically a nine point scale the first thing I do is I I check to see if their pinky goes to 90 degrees if their thumb comes to their forearm on either side that's each of those is one point if they hyper extend their elbows greater than 10 degrees same with the knees and then I want to see if they could put their hands on the floor so I could tell right away Peter doesn't have connective tissue disease even though he can do that the other other things don't add up to enough exactly exactly",
