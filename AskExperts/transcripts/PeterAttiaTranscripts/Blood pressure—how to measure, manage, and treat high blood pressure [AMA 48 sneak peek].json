[Music] here welcome to another AMA how you doing very well thank you awesome you know before we get started on this one some of the people who listen to one or two amas ago when we were going over your decks of results we were talking telling the story about Reese's Pieces and how you had never heard of them and we did a call out to say hey if anyone else has never heard of them please reach out and you will be pleased to know we probably had about 30 to 40 people who are in the same boat as you and had no idea what Reese's Pieces are so you are not the only one not the only one on this planet not the only one I mean again it's 30 to 40 compared to our listenership it's not a good percentage so you're definitely in the minority but yeah shout out to everyone who reached out and the person who was the first to reach out we have something special going in the mail for",

        "text": "definitions so I think it'd be helpful to set the stage early of you know when we say high blood pressure what are the two numbers that we're referring to so people can kind of as they look back at their own blood pressure results can kind of know where they fit well as you said this has changed a little bit so prior to 2017 we had a little bit more leeway in the system but the current updates which have been in place for about six years and which were updated after the Sprint trial in 2015 a trial that I'll explain in a moment leave us where we are today where we are today is normal blood pressure is defined as having a systolic blood pressure at or below 120 or technically below 120 millimeters of mercury over something less than 80 millimeter Mercury so if blood pressure is both less systolically than 120 and diastolically 80 that's considered normal so 119 over 79 normal 121 over 79 technically not normal elevated is when the systolic pressure is between 1 20 and 129 but the diastolic pressure remains less than 80. so we talk about elevated blood pressure as a slight elevation in the systolic but not the diastolic pressure and then we get into two stages of hypertension the first stage is when systolic blood pressure is 130 so we're between 130 and 139 or diastolic blood pressure is between 80 and 89. so does that make sense because you'll notice there's a bit of a gap in there right so you could be 120 over 83 and now you're at stage one one even though your systolic is normal and then stage 2 hypertension is when either systolic exceeds 140 or diastolic exceeds 90. so again in summary normal blood pressure is less than 120 and less than 80. elevated is 120 to 129 over less than 80. stage 1 hypertension is 130 to 139 or 80 to 89 stage 2 is greater than 140 or greater than 90. okay so where do these numbers come from because these aren't just arbitrary",

        "text": "right these are sort of based on something important and that's something important is called the Sprint trial this is a trial I think it was published in 2015 it was like I think it was like about a year or two before these guidelines were shifted and the purpose of this trial was really to ask the question what is the benefit of per lack of a better word aggressive blood pressure control so the study looked at just just under 10 000 people who had a systolic blood pressure of a hundred and thirty or greater who were also at Advanced Cardiovascular risk but who did not have type 2 diabetes and the reason for that patient selection is you wanted a group of people who were at INF risk for ascbd that you could start to see events in a relatively confined period of time you have to remember this is always the goal of clinical trials even when you're doing large double-winded trials you want to be able to have enough events in the trial that you don't have to run the trial for 10 years so you've got a high risk population though it's worth noting they don't have type 2 diabetes and they have to have a systolic blood pressure over 130. so they were randomized into two groups the first group which we'll call the intensive treatment was treated to a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 and the standard treatment were treated to a blood pressure of less than 140. make sense so one group is kind of being treated to not be over 140 the other group was really being pushed down to 120. so at coming in the average blood pressure of all comers was about 140 over 78. now Ethan and I talked about this a little bit but just in case folks didn't hear that podcast or just in case people need a little bit of a refresher is this study did a pretty rigorous job of assessing blood pressure so they used an office visit where blood pressure was measured three times using the following protocol so the patient would sit down",
