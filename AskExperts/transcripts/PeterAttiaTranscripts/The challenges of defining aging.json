        "text": "when i think about you know what is aging um i would say you know over the last several years i have developed uh i think a greater appreciation for a functional definition of aging and so i you know as i start to think more and more about translation of interventions that seem to affect the biological aging process um in laboratory animals outside of the laboratory into the clinic you know i spend a lot of time thinking about well what are some of the functional changes that go along with with aging and and we know that across every organ system in the body we see functional declines that go along with aging and so i've started to think more about you know things like frailty uh uh as an important component of defining aging from a biological perspective you know when when we're talking about having an impact on health and longevity so i think it really depends on the context i guess the other thing i would say is both of those definitions and the way i almost exclusively think about aging unless somebody sort of forces me out of out of my box is from a biological perspective there are other aspects of aging that intersect with biological aging right that are probably as as important as what i think of as fundamental biology of aging to quality of life so social aspects of aging for example are extremely important in people especially right for quality of life as you get older i don't tend to gravitate towards you know that kind of a definition of aging but i do recognize that it's important so you know i think i just i'm naturally always thinking about the biology of aging and and as i already said i tend to focus on the molecular mechanisms that drive the biological changes that go along with aging",
