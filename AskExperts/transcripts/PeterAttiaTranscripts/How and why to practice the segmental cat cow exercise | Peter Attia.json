        "text": "all right the next exercise is segmental cat Cow now many of you who if you for example taken a yoga class are familiar with cat Cow as two extreme positions of spinal flexion and extension purpose of this exercise however is not so much about how far you can get into either of those extreme positions but much more importantly can you transition from one to the other in a segmental fashion the reason this matters so much is by learning segmental control you learn to spread Force out across your spine most of us don't have segmental control and as a result of that we tend to hinge in certain spots for example lower thoracic like T12 and L1 Lumbar and when you hinge there a lot of force adds up there and that force of course leads to injury and pain so let's go through this exercise Beth will put you on all fours and I guess just to show people what's an extreme cat and an extreme cow action yeah so see each one of these things is flexed so cervical thoracic lumbar okay and then extension okay so again for most people that's the extent of cat Cow but what we'd really like to do is see if Beth can move from one to the other almost as though I'm walking along her back and commanding her to just move those vertebrae along the way so you see as I'm doing this all she's doing is selectively moving that vertebrae and she is moving into this position all the way down the line now she can reverse this too do you want to start at the head or do you want to start at the tail let's do the tail first and then okay so now starting at the tail she's going to reverse that and she's just kind of when you're starting out it's actually nice to have a partner because the person touching you actually serves as a proprioceptive q for you to be feeling that vertebrae eventually you'll be able to do this without the cue so watch Beth now do this on her own",
