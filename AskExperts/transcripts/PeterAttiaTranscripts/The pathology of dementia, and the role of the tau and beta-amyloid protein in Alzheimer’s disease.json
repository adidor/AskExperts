        "text": "austin um works with jack delatorre and and they you know really have a strong point of view that says look it's this microvascular disease that is really a big driver here and there's a very compelling rationale for that you mentioned it earlier it's very hard to make it into your seventh eighth ninth decade without unbelievable amounts of microvascular damage and to your point if a critical mass of that is reached it's quite likely that that's going to result in the cognitive impairment and ultimately even higher levels of impairment beyond memory such as executive function and if as you said amyloid is sort of accumulating along the way it makes sense that you could have this mixed picture where you have the the clinical side so you know you meet the criteria for dementia you have amyloid beta and you have a heavy enough burden of vascular disease i guess it begs the question if you had a time machine and you could go back in time for that particular patient and you correct the vascular insult so let's just say in one patient they were you know aggressively you know you aggressively manage their hypertension in another patient you you know kick the smoking cessation in 20 years sooner in another patient you manage the dyslipidemia you're going to impact the vascular stuff do you think that has an impact on the amyloid side of the equation and more importantly does it impact clinically their development of dementia i think definitely yes i mean i know you know again when you had your conversation with richard isaacson",
