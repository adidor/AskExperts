        "text": "that's used by china um which has been extensively given to now again tens of millions of people which is the way that we make the polio vaccine the inactivated polio vaccine or the hepatitis a vaccine or the rabies vaccine so again a lot of experience with that product that there's some question about how effective it is i should also add that the russian vaccine is also a replication defective adenovirus vaccine in that case add 26 human ad 26 followed by human ad five so those are the strategies that are currently wending their way through the world and is it safe to say paul that the either that the whole killed is probably i actually mistakenly said that the attenuated because i tend to lump that in with whole kill but really whole killed is the first play that's really initiated uh vaccination is that kind of the oldest trick well the oldest older oldest trick is is a a live non-human virus i mean the cow pox was was the first vaccine in the late 1700s which so basically the thinking there was that that not that it was thinking at all since this was the late 1700s before we actually knew what viruses were i mean it was just phenomenology but um that that now we know that uh the cow pox virus is energetically related energetically related close enough to human smallpox that immunization with one can protect you against disease caused by the other but you're right the second strategy was the whole killed virus strategy that was 100 years later in the late 1800s in france with louis pasteur making the hole killed for rabies virus",
