        "text": "hand with the reduction in health span in other words by definition when a person has alzheimer's disease their quality of life by either cognition is also deteriorating so they're experiencing both the slide and quality of life and eventually length of life and similarly in people that have advanced atherosclerosis while of course it's true that people die suddenly of heart attacks who are otherwise totally healthy a lot of times um the reduction in you know the ability to carry out activities of daily living kind of moves more hand in hand with that i would say that's a little less the case with cancer obviously cancer is still a disease whose primary risk factor is age so age is the greatest risk factor for cancer just as it is for the other two diseases but it's also in some ways a little bit easier to think of cancer in isolation from the health span stuff the decline in physical and mental and emotional state so if you're trying to imagine a world in which you can live longer as we've discussed many times previously that means living in a world where we delay the onset of chronic disease and or have better tools to live longer with chronic disease but you know that i much favor the former option because we've basically spent most of the history of modern medicine working on the latter option with very very limited success um so okay so let's let's now pause it for a moment that one of the pillars of longevity is minimizing mortality from cancer so where does screening fit into this well screening is one of three pieces that you would",

        "text": "envision right the first piece would be how do you prevent cancer the second thing would be how do you screen for cancer and detect it early and i'll explain why i think that's necessary and the third is how do you treat it when you have it so we can talk a lot about the former how do you prevent cancer we've had many podcasts and we have many podcasts coming up where we're going to get into the treatments of cancer but i want to focus this one on the prevention piece so why do i believe that well this is a controversial topic i want to say first so not all people believe that screening matters but i think the simplest explanation for why screening matters is the evidence that suggests that a cancer that is caught earlier is easier to treat than a cancer that is cost later that is caught later in other words if you catch a breast cancer or a colon cancer when there are tens of millions or hundreds of millions of cancer cells your odds of treating that successfully are better than if you catch the same cancer years later when there are billions of cells and the evidence for that basically comes from examining how patients respond to the exact same drugs in the adjuvant setting versus in the metastatic setting so what does that mean so the adjuvant setting is when a drug is given to a patient who has no visible cancer so these are patients that may have had the visible cancer removed you believe that they have microscopic disease that remains and you give them a drug like herceptin for a her2 new positive breast cancer",

        "text": "and if you compare the outcomes of those patients to the outcomes of patients who are given the exact same drug for the exact same phenotype and genotype of the cancer but in the metastatic setting there's no comparison in the outcomes and one explanation for that may be that the more mature cancers the ones that have been around longer have developed more mutations they are more difficult to treat so it is therefore my belief that the more we can do to screen for cancer and catch it earlier the better we will be but we do pay a price for that we pay a financial price for that in other words it costs money to screen early and we pay potentially an emotional price from that because as we'll get to and you alluded to we have to now get into false positives and false negatives but at a high level bob that's that's how i think about this cancer or the this topic around cancer screening yeah i i think it's it's telling too if you look at statistics um on that they call it five-year survival so what are the odds of you surviving a cancer and then if you look at specific cancers like breast cancer you're talking about uh you catch it early and it's a it's a local cancer it hasn't metastasized and the statistics on that is the five-year survival rates are 90 about 99 and then you you go to a like a distant cancer um so a metastatic breast cancer and it's closer to about 25 in terms of the five-year survival um and also what you alluded to as well the false positives false negatives",
