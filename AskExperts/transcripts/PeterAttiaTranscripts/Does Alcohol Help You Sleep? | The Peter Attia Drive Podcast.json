        "text": "so we got a lot of alcohol questions and we got a lot of alcohol questions related to sleep one of the most frequent questions is can alcohol consumption screw up my sleep i think the answer is hands down i don't think anybody who has had a drink and gone to bed will say otherwise i think there is some confounding data it is a sedative alcohol is a gaba agonist so it will put you to sleep quicker you will lose consciousness more quickly but we should never confuse a loss of consciousness with falling asleep you've heard me say this before a million times i'm sure bob if someone took a baseball bat to your head you would lose consciousness you'd be laying on the ground you wouldn't be moving you might look like you're sleeping but there's nothing that's happening in your brain that mimics sleeping or the restorative nature of sleeping so we never want to confuse consciousness with sleep so alcohol fragments sleep you wake up more times during the night sometimes you don't even realize you're waking up but if you do again pay attention to a sleep tracker you'll probably notice more wake ups and it seems to block rem sleep more than non-rem deep sleep so if you recall i talked about this with matt walker a lot in the podcast i think it was what episode was that the first one i think i think i got it episode 49. so i noticed this personally as well when i have more than probably even two drinks is enough to have this impact on my sleep very little change in my deep sleep but my rem sleep gets very disrupted and gets displaced by more",

        "text": "an afternoon and evening and not necessarily notice an effect but if you start thinking about kind of dinner having two drinks then i'll start to see the deterioration and sleep and the closer those drinks are to bedtime so if it somehow turns into even an after dinner drink or something like that i'll see my resting heart rate really go up easily six eight beats per minute my heart rate variability will be dramatically compressed at a minimum 20 25 but i've seen a 50 reduction of hrv if that alcohol is close to bed my respiratory rate goes up by a couple of breaths per minute and my body temperature will go up by 0.3.4 and this is also dependent on food so you also have this thermogenic effect of food so the more closely i'm eating to bedtime and that's often something that unfortunately happens with alcohol as you start eating more that'll just drive my body temperature up okay and you mentioned too so you're looking at your aura ring for rem sleep so that could be another indicator too if you can track rem sleep you might see a little bit of a decline compared to a night of non-drinking yeah and i suspect that the aura ring and all wearables are using those inputs to determine sleep staging so a follow-up question to that is why do these metrics matter if your body temperature is increased you could see it overnight but say your body temperatures increase before you go to sleep or your respiratory rate is increased or your heart rate is up how can that impact sleep basically these things all suggest to me and i don't know if this is true but it just seems to me that all of these things are suggestive of more sympathetic tone thank you for listening to today's sneak peek ama episode of the drive if you're",
