Peter Hotez Tiger Hotez is a renowned vaccine scientist a pediatrician and an expert on the current coronavirus outbreak his titles are almost too numerous to get into at this point but I'll make an attempt to do so he's the Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine and professor of pediatrics and molecular biology and microbiology at the Baylor College of Medicine where he's also the director of the Texas Children's Center for vaccine development and the Texas Children's Hospital endowed chair of Tropical pediatrics I learned of Peter a few months ago for unrelated reasons that pertained to microbiology vaccinations etc and had wanted to interview him at the time and kind of postponed it for a number of unrelated reasons more recently about three weeks ago I saw him talking about corona virus which was really around the time I started to think I had miscalculated this would have been mid-february the second week of February and I started to realize at that point in time that this was going to be a much bigger deal than I had naively assumed in January I",

Peter Hotez [Music] Peter thank you so much for making time to speak with us you're in unbelievably high demand I saw you on the news at 5:30 this morning your time and I don't think you've stopped since and of course you've been non-stop for weeks now and you've been very generous in making time to speak with me and my team prior to today so again greatly appreciated on behalf of many people listening let's start with a little bit of just the nomenclature people are a little bit confused I think about the nomenclature between kovat 19 SARS Co V to maybe explain which one's the virus which one's the disease and what the history is here Sharik Ovid 19 is official designated name of the disease by the World Health Organization the causative agent is the SARS Co v2 virus SARS coronavirus - just like there's AIDS and there's HIV there's the name of the disease and the name of the virus and and the fact that it's called SARS - as I often like to call it has some meaning because there's a lot of similarity and the type of virus it is compared to the original SARS which I often call SARS one that",
