        "text": "you met you have mentioned a few times on your podcast that you are currently working on writing a book what will the book be about and what is the expected release date so the book will be about my experience as a shepherd what a lot of people don't know about me is prior to you know the stuff I do now I was a shepherd and I you know I just I think there's not a not there not there not a lot of you know pop culture references to shepherds we don't in aren't really sitcoms about shepherds I mean most people just don't know much about what the day in and day out life of a shepherd is like and so I thought that would be a good story to tell to just talk about my experience as doing that and so you know it's been a tough book to write because obviously I have to go back through all of my Shepherd journals which are all bound in leather sheepskin bindings they're beautiful or and I hope to have the manuscript completed by the end of this year which would mean probably a release date in early 2020 now the drawback of having an early 2020 release is I suspect virtually everyone in this country will be hyper fixated on politics at that time as will be spinning up to an election cycle and if your choice is trying to understand if someone's going to challenge the incumbent president from his own party and who the opposition will be versus the life and times of a shepherd I think it's gonna be an uphill slog to try to get the attention of the masses but you know I think one of the other drawbacks of a 2020 release date is people are probably dying for that book to be released and they have to wait a couple of years that's right yeah I think we're the only thing that you can do to expedite this process we'd all be grateful believe me I wish I wish I could I wish I could get to this quicker",
