        "text": "how big a window you have to refeed to maximize muscle growth so so we actually did that first experiment in rats so Josh Anthony and Tracy Anthony were in my lab uh that was just before Lane came uh and what we were looking at was exhaustive exercise again a rodents we were looking at this catabolic State we were trying to look at how to muscle regulate a recovery and so we were looking at what were called initiation factors and we discovered the link between leucine and an initiation Factor called eif4 that is sort of the downstream effect of mtor mtor as a regulator and it stimulates eif4 and S6 and other initiation factors and so what we found was that when you came out of an exhaustive exercise muscle is catabolic until you took in enough leucine to reverse it and so we started looking at feeding right after exercise and Stu Phillips and you know Doug Patton Jones and the Luke Van a lot of people sort of picked up on that um okay so now the caveats um the biggest effect of feeding right afterwards is about a two hour window but that's an untrained individuals um if you begin to look longer you can have a ballot of resistance exercise and you'll detect the difference you'll begin to make them you'll start regulating that red one protein factor and you'll see an anabolic effect the next day 24 hours 36 hours later so when does your protein affect well it makes it more effective all the time um the more trained you get the less you're going to see a post-exercise effect so if you're beginning training you're in the first four weeks post exercise protein probably makes sense if you're well trained you're basically training the same way and you've been doing it for six months I don't see any effect difference between having protein within two hours after exercise versus just having your three or four meals per day you won't see any difference in",

        "text": "either mass or strength yeah I remember having a discussion with Lane as well and and being very surprised by that right being that pleasantly surprised by the way because it says hey look once you get to a point where you're well trained enough you don't have to be so maniacal about meal timing you can just focus on the big picture which is total protein protein quality and spreading it out such that you don't exceed the metabolizable fraction of it at any one sitting right exactly and people you'll hear trainers take that last statement metabolizable energy and you'll hear trainers say well you can't use more than 30 grams at a meal you won't digest it or whatever that's not true I mean you'll digest and absorb 100 grams of protein at a meal but muscle in particular only has a window of around 20 25 to 60 depending on protein quality where it can use it the liver will use all of it I mean it doesn't matter yeah we have what is known as first pass metabolism of protein which confuses the issue even more when you eat a meal of protein approximately 50 percent of the protein is is is degraded to nitrogen and carbon before it ever gets to the blood almost 50 percent the one exceptions the exception to that are the branch chain amino acids leucine isoleucine valine and over almost 75 80 percent of those get into the blood and we're back to that teleological argument why did muscle learn to sense that because that basically shows up in the blood in direct proportion to the meal and the muscle learned to sense that as a meal quality it says oh wow this meal has adequate quality for me to to trigger this very expensive process of protein synthesis protein turnover and until it sees that signal it won't do it [Music]",
