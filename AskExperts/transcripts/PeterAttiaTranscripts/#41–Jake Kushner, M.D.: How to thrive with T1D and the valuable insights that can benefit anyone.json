Jake Kushner a close friend and a pediatric endocrinologist who specializes in helping manage people with type 1 diabetes in this episode we go into great detail about type 1 diabetes probably the biggest takeaway from this episode is that diet can help people not only with type-2 diabetes but also type 1 Jake discusses some of the recent findings in an approach that one of the pioneers in this field dr. Richard Bernstein champion for several decades now managing carbohydrates and protein to manage insulin and glucose and if you're thinking well I don't have type 1 diabetes why does this matter to me the answer is anybody with a pancreas is going to benefit from this and obviously those with a high pancreas which is effectively what is happening in type 1 diabetes we also discuss why many patients who control their blood sugar with high amounts of exhaustion as insulin are at substantially higher risk than people who can control their blood sugar at lower levels of insulin this concept also has implications for everyone else as I said because the word exogenous and endogenous can be interchanged quite easily when it comes to insulin we cover some of the basics the history the increasing prevalence of type 1 diabetes and more importantly what we can do to help kids with this disease and their families and the non diabetics out there learn from them and their disease so without further delay here's my conversation with Jake cush",

Jake guess what my blood sugar is I said what he was 25 I said why are you calling me and not taking carbohydrate because I feel fine so what was his BHB Oh like two or three so he had done to George Cahill experiment where he had this and he Hill subjects were like 6 millimolar 7 millimole 2 or 3 relatively low to be thriving it yeah 25 milligrams per deciliter that's fairly over 1 millimolar and so so he has hypoglycemic own awareness and sort of to quote Peter teal like is this a feature or a bug if it's a feature well he's he's hyperglycemic unaware but he's fine he's bruising around and he had the gumption to call me up if it's a bug well maybe the the Delta in between his book glucose when he called me up with a book because at 25 and a fatal low might be from relatively small I have no idea there are many other things I want to chat about but based on some time constraints I know we need to wrap this up so maybe we'll have to come back and do a discussion about two other things I wanted to get into which is sort of the future of this I certainly remember being involved in the care of patients who got pancreatic transplants that's obviously a transient solution that often comes accompanied with a kidney transplant there are certainly beta cell transplants which have really not been that successful though it's always one of those things where it seems like it's just a year away from being perfect",

Cynthia Kenyon and the amazing work that she did in C elegans from the daf-2 our complex those papers suggest that when you make a modest alteration in insulin signaling the worm lives twice as long and that fundamental observation has now been borne out in model organism after model organism but she did that I mean it's tough to it I mean I've I'm so familiar with Cynthia's work so I don't want to bore people with all of my nuanced thinking on this but it's hard to make that exact comparison to us right because that was a modulation of daf-2 and f-16 so they were she was upping FOXO effectively and downing IGF and to get the real step function change in longevity she had to calorie restrict",
