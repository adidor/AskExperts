        "text": "with them it's really hard so we kind of have to re-learn a lot of this stuff so eventually you sort of progress to the point where you have very little weight on the supporting leg and most of the weight is over here and then eventually you kind of get to the point where you can even pick this leg up and do a bit of the balance here now this looks like it should be really easy because there's not much movement yet it's astonishingly difficult it's much more difficult than that thing i can stand on that balance board with my eyes shut literally i can stand on that balance board and do anything i can dance i can make a clown on myself this is much harder and there's much more involved and if i can go on a good day 20 seconds without a touch that's pretty good so i just want to differentiate again between sort of the subtlety of the real foot lower leg variability versus kind of the gross skills of balance and honestly i think this is a this is a tool as i said it's a surprisingly overpriced thing i don't know how much it cost again but i remember being surprised um but to me it's actually worth every penny and it's something that i'm pretty much stepping on five days a week and again i would recommend starting out without trying to do it in the in the full balanced way but instead just experimenting with it whether it be sitting down and having the leg on it or fully supported as i started out anyway blackboard lower leg variability very important part",
