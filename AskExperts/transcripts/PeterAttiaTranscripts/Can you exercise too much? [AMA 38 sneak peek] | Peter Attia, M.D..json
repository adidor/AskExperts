        "text": "question which is what is the optimal dose of exercise for longevity and quick disclaimer is we're not looking at what is the minimum dose which i think gets written about a lot and i know we've done weekly emails kind of responding to articles that are like you know 10 000 steps 10 minutes of walking a day all these little things are all you need to do so we're going to kind of focus on that core question is like what is the optimum dose so before we get into kind of those types of questions that we compiled anything you want to add to what i just said to set the stage yeah i would add that we're also going to explore uh it can you do too much because most things in biology sort of occupy a goldilocks space not too much not too little i think you know clearly that's the case with nutrition too much nutrition just look around you too little nutrition well that's frankly the problem that you know lots lots of part of the world lots of parts of the world still experience and have historically experienced a lot of so you know with exercise i think that's less clear and that's a topic we also want to really get into today and even if that's not relevant to the majority of the population in other words even if majority of people aren't in the situation where they're butting up against potential limits of exercise in terms of crossing from being benefit to risk i think it's a very important question nevertheless uh and it might speak to some of the the the mechanistic insights around exercise and of course for those people who do want to kind of push the",

        "text": "the benefit in cancer comes through the metabolic benefits that of exercise so um we know for example that the second leading environmental or modifiable risk of cancer after smoking is in fact obesity and as i've probably talked about another podcast i think it's really less the adiposity of obesity that's the problem and the metabolic consequences of obesity that are found in many but not all obese patients obviously diabetes is probably one of the most clear places where you just dramatically see an improvement and this of course has to do with um glucose disposal and insulin sensitivity within the muscle and again i think the list just goes on and on and on but there there really isn't any ambiguity here uh and again we should we should sort of celebrate this fact because there's a ton of ambiguity in a lot of things that pertain to lifespan and health span it's actually nice for once to have a slam dunk yeah definitely so i think what would also be helpful for people is another term i've heard you mentioned before internally as you think about your exercise and how you kind of plot out how you tackle this problem is mets so do you want to let people know what a met is and then why it can be beneficial in looking at a variety of different exercises yeah so i do talk about it a little bit um and i think most people have kind of heard of this idea of a metabolic equivalent or a met um and it's basically an energy currency right so we in the body we think about energy currency and sort of atp but you know that's on such",

        "text": "hours of work done yeah so peter when people think about their mets how do like how is it that knowing how many med hours you're putting out how is that helpful to someone as they think about exercise on a whole you know look i think for most people it's not truthfully um i'm probably one of the few people who tracks my met hours per week and i i don't spend like i don't do it down to the nat's ass i just mean i have a spreadsheet where i'm basically putting in my activity the amount of time i spend doing it at various different intensities and i can at the end of the week say look i'm doing you know 100 met hours per week during this phase of my training during this phase of my training it might be 80. you know back in the old days it was 200 mad hours per week it was you know a much much greater workload um if you're doing one thing that's tied to a power meter like in cycling you know we tend to keep track of kilojoules and normalize power and power so all of these things are just sort of ways to track the work you're doing now i think it partially becomes relevant when you want to evaluate the research because the research you know has to be able to take into account not just how much time you're exercising but what's the intensity of that exercise you know it would be very difficult to provide guidance if we didn't know this for example do we want to say just the amount of distance you run a week tells us everything we need to know are two people who are running 15 miles per week experiencing the same metabolic uh benefit or harm well certainly not right one could be",
