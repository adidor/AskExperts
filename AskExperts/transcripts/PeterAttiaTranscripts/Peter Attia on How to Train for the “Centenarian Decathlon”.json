        "text": "i think that for most people the decline of mind body and and then the burden of disease seems to be won by one in the wrong way meaning the body seems to fail first so it got me thinking that at least for me how would i mitigate that and and so i came up with this idea of um back casting instead of forecasting what i want to do in the end and i borrow that term back casting from annie duke who wrote thinking in bets a book that i love and annie will also be a guest on the podcast soon i hope so the idea of back casting is instead of trying to say well if i'm 25 what do i need to be doing tomorrow when i'm 26 and then what do i need to be doing when i'm 30 and what am i doing before an easier way to do it is say what do i need to be doing when i'm 100 and then how do i work backwards from that and so for me as a ripe old 46 year old uh 45 year old when i started thinking about this the the question was okay well if i want to live to a hundred and again genetically speaking i probably won't because i don't have the genes to to get there but let's assume that you know i can eke my way out to a hundred that's 55 years away what do i have to physically be able to do to be satisfied with my life um and so as i went through that exercise the way i did it was doing it through the lens of my kids so i took the ages of my kids and i projected them forward to how old will they be when i'm a hundred and that's an easy calculation to do obviously anybody can do that for themselves and then i said well probabilistically how old will their kids be so i said well",

        "text": "you know my kids are this this this their kids will be approximately this range and then you realize wow their kids are going to have kids by the time i'm 100. so by the time i'm 100 i'm going to have great grandchildren that will likely be between like one and seven or eight that's basically my calculation okay so then i thought okay well what are the things i'm going to want to be able to do when i'm 100 to just be happy so it goes without saying i would love to not be you know bedridden with disease per se it also goes without saying that i would love to have the the cognitive faculties that i have or at least a high enough amount of them that i'm you know able to sort of you know have the executive function processing speed and you know memory that's necessary to sort of function but then i really kind of double clicked on the physical part of this and um so there are a bunch of activities that i want to be able to do i still want to be able to shoot a bow and arrow i still want to be able to actually exercise like i do enjoy you know some people exercise because they have to i think there are a number of us who exercise because we actually enjoy it and it's fortuitous that it provides benefit um but the one i really focused on was the real simple stuff the activities of daily living and among them is like playing with kids right so i started thinking about well what would i want to be able to do with great grandkids when i'm 100 and they're three four five and in going through that i made a list and there were 18 things on my list and i just began to refer to that as my centenary in decathlon which is problematic because the decathlon has 10 things and my list has 18 things but not within that tiny little detail what's the latin origin of 18",

        "text": "latin origin of 18. yeah like like deca i assume deca is latin for 10 of something right deca octa yeah yeah anyway well whatever okay so we'll come up with a fancier term for it or i'll figure out a way to consolidate let us know so so my centenarian decathlon has these 18 things that i want to be able to do when i'm 100. and some of them seem so trivial that you'd be like how is that even on your list but like for example i want to be able to get up off the floor with a single point of support which means i want to be able to using just one arm get up off the floor now it's not that it's the end of the world if i need to use two arms but like i want to hold myself to that standard um i want to be able to drop into a squat position and pick up a child that weighs 30 pounds i want to be able to lift something that weighs 30 pounds over my head because that's about the weight of my little rollerboard suitcase and i would really be bummed if i couldn't put that in the overhead compartment of an airplane presumably i'll still be flying on airplanes and you know those will still exist you'll be flying yourself yeah yeah right we'll all have little jet packs or something um you know i want to be able to get myself out of a pool without a ladder simple right again how trivial is that to do today where you have you know four inches between the concrete and the water and how how easy is it for us to just pull ourselves out today without the ladder we've seen the guys that can jump without support they can jump out of a pool just jump out of a pool onto the platform",

        "text": "no yeah i think there's some videos nice for that yeah so when i go through that whole thing i then say okay what are physical tasks that would approximate those things so for example like picking up the 30-pound kid who comes running at you could be approximated by a 30-pound goblet squat um you know lifting 30 pounds above your head in the form of a suitcase is also pretty easy to approximate with these things and the goblet squat just uh for the uninitiated i usually think of it as like a kettlebell but almost like you're holding a goblet in front of you it's like a front squat that's right you're going down coming up that's right imagine yeah so picking up a child so um so then i've just been working backwards from there which saying well if i want to be able to do these things at 100 there's going to be a decline i have to be able to do these things at 80. i'm going to need to be able to do it at this level at 60 and i need to be able to do it at this level today again given the inevitable decline and so most of my training today in fact i would argue all of my training today centers around that i no longer train for anything that's not related to that so i don't do any training that's related to racing or competing in anything which is not to say it's bad to do those things i'm just saying that that's the point i'm at in my life and so this is kind of a long-winded answer to what i think is a great question which is a 25 year old who's frankly thinking of something that i most 25 year olds i can't imagine would",
