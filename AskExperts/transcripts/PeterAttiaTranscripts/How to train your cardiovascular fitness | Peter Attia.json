        "text": "2 because we have so many podcasts within you go son Milan people can listen to but you kind of hinted at another thing there which is you know when you start your zone two workouts you'll ramp up but also a lot of times we get questions where you know hey I did a 90 minute workout and I was in zone two for 45 minutes of it is that am I good no I mean what I think what you mean in that question is you know like I went out for a three-hour bike ride today and um when I got back my computer told me I was in I did 44 minutes of zone two so two issues there one is that's just a zone two based on heart rate that's generally the worst approximation of zone two so zone two really is more based on lactate if we're going to be purely accurate or at a minimum rpe but even if you posit that that 45 minutes of Zone 2 from your heart rate is roughly accurate it's not the same physiologically because usually you're passing in and out of zone two in that situation and so you're not getting kind of that constant steady state churn which you're looking for we're really kind of looking for is the harnessing of mitochondrial efficiency and to do that you just you have to be able to push oxidative phosphorylation right to its limit before you trip into glycolysis and you're just you're at the limit of that glycolysis being the dominant energy source whereas if you're on that ride you're going into and out of glycolysis constantly so it's not that you're so much in zone two for 45 minutes as that you passed through zone two for a sum total of 45 minutes which again that's still there's still value in that but not for what we're talking about yeah and what about VO2 max what modalities can you do VO2 max training on uh you know here I think it's it's probably easier in a way right because it's pretty much anything that gets your heart rate up and gets you very tired",
