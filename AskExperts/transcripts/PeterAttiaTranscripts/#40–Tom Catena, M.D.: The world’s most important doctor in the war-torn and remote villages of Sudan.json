Tom Katina now I want to preface this by saying something that you don't know one hand is a little bit embarrassing to admit but I think it also speaks to sort of the significance of Tom I've been very privileged over my life to have met many quote/unquote important people people who are very rich or people who are very famous or people who have accomplished great things athletically or otherwise for whatever reason I've never been nervous going into the first meeting with somebody who is quote-unquote special not sure why maybe just deep down and kind of get that we're all kind of the same and just because one person smarter or runs faster or you know made more money you know in the end it doesn't really matter that much and we're all the same but I gotta say I've known about Tom for about three years we've exchanged emails in the past but this interview was the first time I met Tom in person and I only know how to say this just bluntly it's the first time in my life I've ever been nervous to meet a human being which of course is ironic when you meet Tom and this will come across in this episode because he is quite simply the most humble human being you could ever meet but I I suppose I see in Tom what I consider to be the greatest of any qualities or characteristics of any human being and so it humbled me and intimidated me to meet him since about the year 2000 tom has been a missionary",
