        "text": "i was mentioning to a patient yesterday i think you could potentially make a case that the association between alcohol consumption and alzheimer's disease could potentially be mediated almost entirely through the absolute destruction of sleep that alcohol causes especially sleep fragmentation one of the things that we've been seeing routinely in our work with alzheimer's disease and sort of alzheimer's disease pathology within the brain is that fragmented sleep sleep that isn't nice and continuous that has multiple awakenings throughout the night it's not just about quantity of sleep it's about two forms of quality one is consistency in other words going to sleep and going and waking up at the same time and keeping that nice and consistent don't shuttle that around the 24-hour clock face they've been going to bed at 1am one night and 10 p.m the next night and then midnight that confuses your biology we are creatures of rhythm that's how we were designed and our bodies love consistent rhythm and when you force it out of that rhythm your circadian rhythm as a consequence is markedly disrupted it's what we call social jet lag where you're sort of sleeping late going to bed late at the weekend and then you kind of need to drag it back it's like flying back and forth across the country so consistency is a good one from one night to the next from one night to the next from one night to the next within the night however the second part of quality is just having continuous sleep with as few awakenings as you can that's where alcohol is vicious it will litter your sleep with numerous awakenings and those numerous awakenings mimic exactly what we see as a sleep phenotype that predisposes you to a higher alzheimer's disease risk and i think people need to understand that",

        "text": "they are not necessarily conscious of those awakenings this is one of those things where there's some people who say look when i drink alcohol man it's a sedative it puts me out and i certainly used to think that until i started wearing the ring because the ring shows you no actually first of all you're never getting down into deep sleep you're basically vacillating between non-rem light and one-minute wake-ups where you're not fully awake and conscious but you're actually even probably out of theta waves and you're just sort of bouncing back and forth between god knows what maybe alpha theta alpha theta alpha theta something like that and so at the surface level at the level of your cortex you feel like well i'm groggy enough this is sleepy but but in reality no it's highly interrupted and of course there's the other little stuff that i think people sort of miss out on which is you know alcohol inhibits vasopressin so it's a potent diuretic you know someone who's not used to getting up at night to pee is very likely going to get up and pee just from the alcohol not from the volume of the liquid but because of its impact on inhibiting the antidiuretic hormone so it's just adding insult to injury because you get these frequent what we call sort of arousals or frequent and sort of awakenings and then you will have a top of that these bathroom breaks which are even harder to then sort of get back into set as it were and get into sleep those two things together do not make a happy sleep marriage in that regard and that fragmented sleep we know seems to be a predisposing factor for greater likelihood of amyloid and tau pathology which are the two proteins that seem to contribute right now to alzheimer's even if we say well we don't know exactly if the staging is accurate",
