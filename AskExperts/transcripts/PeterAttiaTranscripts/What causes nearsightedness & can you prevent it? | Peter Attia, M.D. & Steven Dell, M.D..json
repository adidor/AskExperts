        "text": "of the population is now nearsighted in certain southeastern asian cities when that becomes such a dominant phenotype something is really oddly off so so this really transcends evolution because you can change if you can change something in years within the it's not evolutionary it's within the eye it's adaptive within the eyeball itself so if you take a group of children and this has been done seven to 11 year old children and you send half of them outside for 80 minutes during the school day for recess and half of them stay inside in an indoor environment for their recess the risk of or the incidence of nearsightedness is 50 percent higher higher or it's half in the group that went outside so you cut your risk in half by going outside now we think that without any instruction to go and look at things far away but just by the very fact that if you're outside there's so much more to see and you're going to be looking further out right and it and this has been further studied in terms of is it just being outside or is it the light yeah it's actually both but the light is really the most important driver of protection from nearsightedness so if you are outside on a bright sunny day you're releasing a fair bit of dopamine from your retina and dopamine inhibits the growth of the eye so the worst thing you could do is stay inside in a dimly lit room and perform near tasks that raises your risk of nearsightedness 16-fold compared to kids who go outside i'm sure",

        "text": "there's epidemiology that would suggest that the further you are from the equator does that imply that you have a greater risk of near-sightedness just based on the light part of this argument yes there is some data to look at that that shows that and not only that they've taken children and given them equal intervals of outdoor activity but the ones who had noontime outdoor activity did better than the ones who were outdoors at 8 a.m where there was less illumination and we know from animal models that it is illumination that is critical in this dopamine release so you know does that mean we need more skylights in classrooms or more windows we need more natural light could we artificially mimic some of the sunlight by making these rooms brighter and predict and prevent some of this myopia epidemic is a photon a photon a photon i mean does it i mean i i don't think that it's known frankly peter whether that's the case because there are different there's a whole spectrum of light so is the blue light more important this is tangential and we'll talk about this i know but blue light you hear all this negativity about blue light blue light is critical for wakefulness or attention for i think for preventing myopia and by the way when we say myopia nearsightedness it's not just the inconvenience of wearing glasses or contact lenses or having laser vision correction when you're 23 years old there are pathologies that are much more common in very near-sighted patients compared to the general population it's much more common to see cataract formation in myopic patients they get something called myopic macular degeneration they're at risk for glaucoma they're at",
