        "text": "can create these these uh these predictive algorithms and so what the the idea that has emerged from that is you can do that at the population level and then if you identify individuals whose chronological age doesn't match up really perfectly well with their epigenetic age in other words they lie off of that best fit line that those people may be biologically younger or older than their chronological age and so that's where this idea of these epigenetic clocks has come from is you then at least in principle can predict a person's biological age depending on how well they fit the best fit line for this this algorithm and i think that the evidence in support of that um comes mostly from from longitudinal studies in humans where you can you can create a training set and a test set and you know what the future outcomes were for some of these people they've been sampled you know let's say over 20 years and indeed you can see a a relationship between the people who's predicted biological epigenetic age uh say is younger than their chronological age and then when they when you look at them 20 years later they have a lower likelihood of developing specific diseases or potentially of dying so i think that's that's that's the case that can be made for these epigenetic clocks that they are telling you something about future um future risk i think in my view the limitation to these epigenetic clocks there's several uh one is that there are about two dozen of them and and honestly i can't tell from the way people argue with each other which are the best and which aren't um but i think more what concerns me is nobody has ever done what i would view as the definitive experiment which is to actually show in the same individual or in the same population that you can you can actually predict future health outcomes now some",

        "text": "people will argue that the longitudinal data you know makes that not not necessary i think there are a couple reasons why why i don't agree with that one big one is that the environment that we live in as humans has changed dramatically over the last three decades and we know that environment plays a huge role in epigenetic modifications and so the epigenetic marks that are that were most relevant for health outcomes 30 years ago might not be the most relevant today so that's that's one the other is this is actually a pretty easy experiment to do in mice and it really bothers me that nobody has done it yeah i was going to ask you that matt so how many times is someone doing a mouse study that is going to the end of life i mean like as we sit here speaking right like so so why do we not have the definitive lifespan study for each of these epigenetic clocks i think that's a legitimate question i don't i don't know the answer i mean people will tell you that you know the clocks aren't as good in mice and look it should be doable and honestly it should have been done three four years ago so so i think that's a it's a you know it's a black hole in the literature that hasn't been filled yet and just to be explicit i mean i think the experiment you want to do right is you take a cohort of mice at say 20 months you measure their epigenetic age in blood you do a few interventions that we know should extend lifespan right you measure their epigenetic age in blood six months later you do it six months later and then you see at an individual and population level what the what the survival is and you can do end of life pathology and so if the clocks are working you should absolutely be able to detect that signature well in advance of end of life right and",
