        "text": "unfortunately an under involvement of clinical trial leadership these steering Committees of these trials have a dearth of women cardiovascular investigators there was a paper a couple years ago that looked at Major cardiovascular trials you know published in the leading journals New England Journal Jama Lancet you know only 10 percent of trial leaderships midis were women and more than half about 56 of these trial leadership committees had no female representation on the trial none of the trial steering committee were women investigators and less than 10 percent had a woman in the first or last author position and which would indicate a senior leadership position we know from other studies that the likelihood that a study will report a sex and gender-specific Analysis actually is you know increased when there's more women authors of the study and more first and last authors women I think women tend to publish more about science related to women so I do think it matters there is some data from my work and some other work from other authors that have shown a modest correlation it's not perfect but a correlation between the proportion of women authors the the trial steering committees and enrollment of women participants in trials for example we did this for afib and we showed that for every one percent increase in women authors there was a 19 higher enrollment of women participants in the trials I mean there's a lot that we can do to tackle this one of them is having more representation and by diversifying study team and investigators I think also we need to include more patients and trial designs include more women in trial designs patient-centered designs you know we hear that women are approached but often our decline participating in trials and I think women tend to be a little bit more risk adverse and this is where it's really important to provide education dispel misconceptions",
