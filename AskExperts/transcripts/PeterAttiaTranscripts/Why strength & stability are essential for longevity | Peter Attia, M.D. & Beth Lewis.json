        "text": "and i think this is a perfect analogy for us as humans if you have muscles that have great strength great contractile force but that force can't get transmitted to the outside world i.e through your feet and your hands that's how we transmit force to the outside world because you lack the stability which means force is escaping through the knees through the hips through the ankles through the back through the waist all of these areas then you're not gonna transmit force well and furthermore if you don't have the ability to load the feet or the hands correctly you're gonna further more experience what we would think of in a race car is slippage so you have the most powerful motor in a car but it has a loose chassis that powers all over the place if it has lousy tires there's no grip yeah in in training we call those energy leaks exactly yeah so it's like you're you're moving something from point a to point b but if you're not able to respond to it with what you're moving it with there could be a leak yeah use the example of a bicep curl something like that if you're doing a bicep curl and you're holding the weight and the weight overcomes you because your grip and your fingers aren't strong enough that energy is going to leak through the wrist as opposed to sharing force through the tissue and i think it's important to remember too with stability we often think of bracing like hanging on for dear life and over bracing is just as detrimental as not bracing enough um so we have to train stability in a way so you can be malleable and and reflexive um as opposed to just hanging on for dear life yeah in fact that's the i like the word stability with one exception and it's that which is for most people stability conjures up the image of static stability that's the",

        "text": "wrong way to think about it you want to think about kinetic or dynamic stability and that's why a world-class pitcher can throw a hundred mile an hour fastball and i can't right it's not necessarily that he's that much stronger than me it's that when he throws that ball there is zero escape from his toe to his finger whereas if i do it and again it's a kinetic motion i'm losing power everywhere i cannot transmit like a whip across my body that sequential force transfer is is important and it's important to remember that that's vital for being a human you know even even walking you have to be able to transfer that force through your feet yeah absolutely so so how important is this stuff well look as as as a member of this species you've pretty much peaked in terms of your muscle mass and strength by about the age of 25. so most of you watching this are over 25. uh so we're all on the downhill side of this thing um and for some of you if you've been you know voracious exercisers your whole life you'll you'll already understand what that feels like i know that i'm not as strong i don't have as much muscle mass i'm i'm half the man i was when i was 25. but the good news is uh we can do a lot to mitigate that so so how bad is it well if you look at the published literature on this subject matter from the age of 25 until about the age of 50 we would expect to lose about three to eight percent of our muscle mass by decade that's a pretty wide range and it speaks to how much you can offset that by training right yeah i mean if you train obviously you'll do much better if you don't train the rate of decline",

        "text": "is staggering it is in fact uh it's not uncommon for a person by the time they're 70 to 75 to have lost 50 percent of their muscle mass from their peak in life so why does that matter well it turns out that there are a couple of physical metrics that are insanely correlated with longevity and again it's impossible to know exactly how causal these are because you can't do this experiment so we're left sort of looking at correlations but the strength of these correlations suggests that there's causality in them and the two associations that are so strong with longevity are muscle mass and strength which couple very tightly together and vo2 max so beth you and dan have done a ton of work on this kind of walk us through what you found as the sort of pillars of strength that are essential so i mean a lot of people um kind of correlate exercise with more sports but we're thinking more activities of daily life so you know picking up an object taking it downstairs putting something on a shelf and you know a lot of that requires things that you don't even think about so being able to reach grip strength not just squeeze strength but also finger dexterity so grip strength and finger strength and even grip modulation um grip reactivity those that is that was kind of the first chunk that we found very very very important so basically how do your hands interact with the outside world whether it's turning a doorknob right picking something up yeah or reaching for something yeah and when we think of the hand you don't think of all the things that your hands do like you don't just grab",
