Cameron when he was doing a Whipple procedure you got to retract and you got to remove the gallbladder you have the privilege of being yelled at if you're really lucky well I mean it's funny because if you were in the general surgery categorical program you couldn't wait to get in there and do that now of course if you were one of the neurosurgery residents that might not be as appealing because you're like oh my god you know I just got to get through this thing but but I loved it so anytime I got to be in the o.r with dr.

Cameron is holding the Bovie which is this is called the electric artery but everyone just calls it a Bovie and this is a device that revolutionised surgery it's hard to imagine you could do surgery without electric cautery so this is a device that cuts and simultaneously cauterizes so almost everything we're doing in surgery is using this device and it was invented by of course cushion and so as he's holding the Bovie and he's starting to get a little act now that she doesn't even have a clue yeah he says he invented the device I'm holding in and he rattles off whatever year it was 1907 no idea no idea he must have rattled off ten other hints she finally blurts out her best answer Ben Carson who at the time was a pediatric neurosurgeon Hopkins who of course has since gone on to become a volitans and he loses it he's like I suggest you learn your history of neurosurgery I couldn't wait to get out of the oh are that day to",
