        "text": "uh what are the the drivers of of risk in patients with with high lpa and we're starting to study that then we see that there is some residual risk effect even in patients with with high lpa so we see that for instance uh if you have a high lpa but have lower crp levels or lower like inflammation you might be you might not have a risk that's as high as if you have high crp so you can argue that residual inflammation is very important but there need to be more studies on this because one can make the case that while it might be the same for smoking or type 2 diabetes or any other cardiovascular risk factor that you can think of but even then if even if lpa is not fully penetrant it is so common that uh it is by far the most important form of this lipidemia that will explain a lot of cardiovascular events at the population level and what i find so tragic about that statement is the number of good physicians out there really great doctors that are working hard taking care of patients frontline physicians family medicine physicians internists who have no idea what it is you know you ask them about it and they look at you as though you've asked them something in a different language i still struggle to understand that disconnect given its urgency i i wonder if that's a uniquely american phenomenon do you have any insight i know you're not a clinician but do you have an insight as to whether or not the literacy around this in canada and europe is higher i don't have any reasons to believe that the literacy in canada or europe is higher than it is in the in america even",
