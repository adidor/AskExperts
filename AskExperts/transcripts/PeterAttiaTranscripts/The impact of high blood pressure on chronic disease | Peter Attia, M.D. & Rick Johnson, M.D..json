        "text": "um okay so let's talk a little bit about blood pressure um it seems to play a very important role in really all of the major chronic diseases except for cancer and if there's a role in cancer i don't know what it is but there who knows maybe somebody knows that but certainly when we come to neurodegenerative disease cardiovascular disease cerebrovascular disease and renal disease uh which are really the main pillars of of death um hypertension seems to work against you um so what is it about everything that we've spoken about that ties into hypertension yeah so high blood pressure which is sometimes called primary or essential hypertension is extraordinarily common in our country um and throughout the world maybe one-third of adults have high blood pressure i mean it's huge percentage how is it defined today in most places of the world it's defined as a blood pressure greater than 140 over 90. 140 over 90 or higher but in this country uh recently it was redefined as being greater than 130 over 80. but i i think that for the majority of the world um the definition is 140 over 90. and from a physiologic perspective where do you fit on that spectrum i mean you're the nephrologist so you take care of the organ that is arguably the most sensitive to blood pressure you could make a case that even more than the heart and the brain the kidney is the first place that damage shows up i don't know if you would agree with that but is that is that a true statement",

        "text": "well there's actually three main sites where high blood pressure really causes problems and the first one is stroke it's the major cause of stroke it's also the major cause of heart failure and it's one of the two major causes of kidney disease and so those are the three main pressure related uh diseases pressure that related conditions where pressure is driving the higher the pressure the higher the risk for stroke heart failure and kidney disease the studies show that the greatest risk for stroke heart failure and kidney disease or when the blood pressure is like 170 160 to 180 systolic is kind of the turning point where when it's above that level there's really a dramatic increased risk for these conditions but it's been known for a long time that there's been that there's a tendency for a linear relationship between blood pressure and stroke and blood pressure and heart failure going all the way down to 120 over 80. so um so there are a lot of people that would like to say that you know 120 over 80 or 130 over 80 should be our cutoff because it's really a linear relationship but most uh you know studies done like around 1900 showed that less than 5 percent of the population had blood pressures of over 140 over 90. um and so based upon the the normal gaussian curve of the population back then uh probably about 140 or 90 should was the cutoff for what was thought to be high and i i'm a believer that 140 over 90 is",

        "text": "a good mark for where we should be uh viewing hypertension um as a condition that really should involve you know active management so rick does that imply that if somebody has a blood pressure of 135 over 85 which would be below the cutoff that you're saying you would deem the time to act of 140 over 90. at 135 over 85 you could roll around at that blood pressure indefinitely without any damage to the kidney yes exactly so there's relatively minimal risk with a blood pressure 135 over 85. it it it but however it's uh in epidemiology studies over many years you can show that you know 120 over 80 is superior to 135 over 85. thank you for listening to this week's episode of the drive if you're interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you more in-depth exclusive content without relying on paid ads it's our goal to ensure members get back much more than the price of the subscription now to that end membership benefits include a bunch of things one totally kick-ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic paper person thing we discuss on each episode the word on the street is nobody's show notes rival these monthly ama episodes or ask me anything episodes hearing these episodes completely access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having to listen to spiels like this the qualis which are a super short podcast that we release every tuesday through friday highlighting the best questions topics and tactics discussed on previous episodes of the drive this is a great way to catch up on previous episodes without having to go back and necessarily listen to everyone steep discounts on products that i believe in but for which i'm not getting paid to endorse and a whole bunch of",
