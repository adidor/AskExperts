        "text": "when I bring up testosterone replacement therapy for men the question I get asked the most is about prostate cancer now I've documented and discussed this in so much detail I think I've probably done two if not maybe three podcasts on the subject including a dedicated AMA podcast on all things that relate to testosterone as far as risks and benefits and um I would say we've spent more time on this than than just about anybody perhaps not as much as you we came away from this analysis with the belief that there was no evidence that exogenous testosterone application was increasing the risk of prostate cancer and there was actually some evidence that hypogonadism may not be increasing the incidence of prostate cancer but may have increased the incidence of high grade prostate cancer furthermore we saw virtually no evidence that exogenous testosterone therapy was leading to an increase in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease though there was one study that suggested in the short run I.E within one year highly susceptible men might see an increase in the risk of ascvd but that risk decreased at two and three years post-treatment so with that being my current state of understanding can you fill in the gaps let's talk about is this a great topic so so look this this thought that testosterone causes prostate cancer started in 1941 Huggins and Hodges Nobel Prize based on one patient one patient in 1941 when they gave exogenous testosterone the prostate cancer got worse if you look at the different paradigms the American Urologic Association in 2018 came out with the testosterone guidelines guideline on that under Section patients should be informed there's no association between testosterone and prostate cancer strong recommendation so finally patients say I Googled it I",
