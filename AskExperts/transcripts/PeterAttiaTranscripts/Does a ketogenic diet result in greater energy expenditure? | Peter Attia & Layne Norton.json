        "text": "that could still be very significant over a long enough period of time there has been a significant debate about the validity of doubly labeled water in a ketogenic diet you mentioned john speakman he and kevin hall wrote a review about this suggesting that doubly labeled water really doesn't apply there's an artifact in a ketogenic diet so if you just look at the chamber data and say well you know 50 kcal per day does that really matter not sure but regardless it wasn't 250 or 500 kcal per day and to me that was a very important insight because prior to that point i didn't really know because if you look back at you know the vermont study from the 1960s if you look back at ansel keys stuff where they didn't have metabolic chambers they're on wards but it wasn't quite the same it was really unclear to me i would say today the evidence has to be overwhelming that if for example a ketogenic diet produces remarkable weight loss it has to be doing it through intake reduction not through an increase in energy expenditure i think that you're 100 right and i'm going to take that kind of piecemeal so the first thing i will say is let's throw out the energy expenditure stuff for now i know we just spent a lot of time talking about energy balance it's important but we're assuming that these measures are accurate there's even air in direct telemetry because you can only measure as accurately as your equipment that you have to measurement that's right and and that those numbers i just touted you could argue that they were at the limit of detection at least for the indirect calorimeter the 57 kcal per day was probably right at the detection so it could have been zero it could have been a hundred it's we're",

        "text": "we're really you know we're really on a razor's our uh edge of detection and i think that the point you made was that you know the carbohydrate insulin model of obesity would predict a much bigger change in energy expenditure so therefore at least that version of it it has to be falsified based on that and even with the 150 calories that would not explain the difference and again if we look at studies that assess loss of body fat under controlled environments we just don't see differences between low carb and low fat when calories are controlled calories in protein are controlled we don't see it in fact there's actually a very small favoritism towards low fat but again i think that that's probably a data artifact and not actually a real difference um there was you mentioned david ludwig there was a reese or more recent um meta-analysis he did that got a lot of buzz because basically his his assertion was that well if you look at the short term data yes there doesn't appear to be much difference but if you look at after 17 days there appears to be you know a large difference in the energy expenditure anywhere from like 150 to 300 calories per day favoring low carb was that with doubly labeled water again that's it so that's so the issue was and i went through this with a fine-tooth comb and again the meta-analysis itself was very well done the statistics were very good but when there was metabolic chamber data",
