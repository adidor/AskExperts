        "text": "last question here on exercise before we move on um it's one you've kind of talked about in various forms but i just thought it'd be interesting to kind of knock it out in another setting just based on this thread which is this user said i'm consistently conflicted about how to approach the second half of my life on one hand i hear a lot about calorie restriction being a key driver to longevity on the other hand i hear about maintaining muscle mass as a key driver for me it seems to be like one or the other they said they're a naturally lanky person and calorie restriction seems to prevent them from gaining much strength and muscle but when they wrap up their calories they can put on some muscle but they're not getting the benefits of calorie restriction so the kind of overarching question is how do you think about calorie restriction muscle building for a person from a longevity perspective and does that change if you're 30 50 70 and on top of that even does it change based on your body type if you're someone who is naturally lanky that has a hard time putting on muscle versus someone who is more muscular yeah i mean there's a very good question and there's a lot embedded within it i think that in no particular order taking some of those issues i think the older you are the more important it is to emphasize anything that's going to allow you to maintain and build strength and maintain muscle mass so that would make me very um reluctant to put an excess fasting routine in place for for somebody like that especially if they're not heavy to begin with which of course then gets to the second equally important consideration which is a big big part of this is body",
