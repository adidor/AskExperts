        "text": "okay we've got another topic on how to talk engage and question your doctor and this is related to a couple of weekly emails where you talked about how to find a good doctor and questions to ask of your doctor and another weekly email that talked about colorectal cancer and screening in particular colonoscopies and there are a number of questions that were considered for a gi doc we got a lot of questions around how do i ask my doctor these types of questions without offending him or her and essentially really how do i approach my doctor with this information i think it really comes down to relationships and i think physicians are in a tough spot these days especially those that are kind of in a culture of managed care where you know they're really held to a standard that i think is not fair which is you've got to see patients probably to the tune of six an hour and if you're not doing that you're sort of not doing your job now imagine that if you only had 10 minutes with a patient and they were coming in for whatever they were coming in for and then all of a sudden they wanted to ask you questions about a topic without you even knowing what the topic is in advance it's asking a lot and the first thing i would say is you got to know your audience a little bit what type of a rapport you have with your doctor and is there a way that you can kind of preview the information that you want to talk about with them prior to the appointment now again i'm sure that doctors are not at home sitting there asking hey how can i come up with extra work to do when i'm home like reading patients emails and such but i still think at least you have a chance",
