Arne Levine who discovered p53 and that was an inspirational experience because he is got scientific insight that's absolutely incredible and then I went on to Cold Spring Harbor lab where I was a postdoc with Bruce Stillman and again another incredible scientist and it was an incredible scientific environment there were a whole cadre of investigators there that were making major contributions in the field of cancer at the time and it was just a very thrilling experience to be in an",
