        "text": "okay you have referenced to the estrogen ation of man as one of the most important yet largely uncovered trends what is this what causes it and what can be done to fix it I feel a little bit bashful trying to answer this question because truthfully I don't think I'm robust enough in my understanding of the fact base I think I have enough of the facts to appreciate the trend but I don't think I fully appreciate all that's going on if you take a look at if you took a bunch of men in the 1950s and you drew their blood and you measured their testosterone levels their estrogen levels etc and you did the same thing today with a similar cohort you match them for as many variables as you could you would notice that their testosterone today is lower and their estrogen today is higher and so the question is why I don't think we know the answer but one of the things probably would have to do with just the increase in obesity because obesity obviously implies more adipose tissue adipose tissue is where we're going to see more of the enzyme called aromatase that turns testosterone into estrogen and so if you have more adipose tissue and potentially more aroma taste you will undergo that chemical reaction more of turning the testosterone into estrogen silly question but is that is that a part of like the nature of puberty when if women are putting on more fat that it's converting some of that testosterone to estrogen probably although I think for the case of women going through puberty the dominant production of estrogen of courses and the gonads so I don't know how much of the testosterone estrogen conversion is actually taking place for them or more to the point how much it contributes to the overall level of estrogen because as we know for example if you just take a step back and you look at a woman's ovulation cycle yes testosterone varies a little bit during her ovulation cycle it might vary by a",

        "text": "factor of 2x but estrogen can vary by more than so you know that that's really being controlled at the level of the ovary I think another factor that has been proposed and I think is worthy of exploration and honestly this is a topic I would love to find the world's expert on and explore in detail is chemicals that can mimic the effects of estrogen and or increase the production of estrogen and so lots of plastics have been proposed to do this again I don't think all plastics are created equal so I I'm not sure that you know putting your your leftover cereal I was gonna say who has leftover cereal I don't know but putting like your leftover whatever into your plastic Tupperware into your fridge I don't know how much of a role that's playing versus say drinking your coffees out of cups that have those little plastic lids especially where the slit that you drink is superfine and therefore you know you're probably more likely to sort of soluble eyes some of those plastics there so look one of the things we do with with with patients is we just sort of try to get them off plastics especially off plastics that are going to have any temperature any any high temperature with them so you know I'm kind of the hard liner in my household about this stuff which is we just switched over to all the glass containers we still use some plastic stuff but I try to like limit like if I make whipped cream I'll put it in there and put it in the fridge because it's basically starts cold stays cold less of a concern you know I try to and again sometimes I'd lose this fight but I try to make sure we don't put anything plastic in the dishwasher again part of it is like if I'm not there to do the dishes who might have gripe about it but if I'm doing the dishes I'm not putting plastic in the dishwasher I'm just gonna wash that stuff by hand how much of the stuff how",
