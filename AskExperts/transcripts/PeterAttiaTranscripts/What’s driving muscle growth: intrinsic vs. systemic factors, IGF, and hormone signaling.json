        "text": "cortisol as well and into signaling i'm sure so growth hormone not anabolic to skeletal muscle uh and the growth hormone response to exercise appears to be mostly substrate driven that it's that growth hormone probably increases as a response to exercise to increase lipolysis to liberate free fatty acids for use as an energy substrate now here's where people get confused the igf-1 the autocrine igf-1 that is released by the muscle tissue itself in response to mechanical tension is very anabolic so let let me just explain for a moment to people the difference between endocrine paracrine and autocrine so the endocrine function of something is when a hormone gets released and its effect is all throughout the body so you know insulin is a great example right so the pancreas the beta cell releases insulin insulin goes and acts on all sorts of cells in the body paracrine is when something when a hormone gets released and it only impacts the cells right next to it and autocrine is on itself as you would guess now going back to what you said earlier the i the one way we explain this to patients is igf-1 is the integral of growth hormone so if you want to get a sense of how much growth hormone is floating around to a first-order approximation you get a sense of how much igf somebody has you get a sense of how much igf is being produced by the liver and to your point that's all systemic or what we would really think of as an endogen an endocrine igf now what you're about",
