[Music] hey bob how's it going today going well peter how are you it's good it's a little unusual today we're uh we're doing this a little bit on the old school tip no video today we're going to be a little bit more descriptive in our terms since people can't watch our facial expressions although that somehow provided any value we won't do any screen sharing i think we can manage what do you have in store for us today so i aggregated a whole bunch of questions around hrv heart rate variability and alcohol many questions on both those topics i know this has been something you've been asking me about for a year when are we going to do one on hrv when are we going to do one on hrv so i think the answer is now all right we'll dive in first question seems relevant what is hrv and it's funny this is a tougher question to answer without an image but i'll do my best so as you pointed out a",

        "text": "second ago hrv stands for heart rate variability and that's a pretty descriptive term because what it measures is the variation in time between heartbeats and that's measured in milliseconds so a thousand milliseconds is one second so if a person's heart is beating 60 times per minute you might say well there's a thousand milliseconds between every beat but it turns out that it's not really that way you see even if your heart is beating 60 times per minute or once per second between the first beat and the second beat it might be a thousand ten milliseconds and between that beat and the next beat it might be 960 milliseconds and between that beat and the beat thereafter it might be 1027 milliseconds when you start looking at this thing at the level of thousandths of a second you realize that there is actually some variability if anybody has ever seen an ekg which i'm sure everybody has seen but maybe you haven't thought so much about what all the little squiggly lines mean without going into the details of what the p wave and the q r s and t waves mean i think most people will recognize that there is a very big spike for each of those beats and that's actually the r spike if you now measure the distance between the r's we call that the rr interval and you take the root mean square of the successive differences between the heartbeats so that means you calculate the time difference between each rr interval each of those values is squared so multiplied by itself then the result is averaged before the square root of the total is obtained so this is kind of a mathematical method for trying to",

        "text": "approximate differences you get what's called the rmssd again if you just think about that in units you took something that was in milliseconds you squared it so it became milliseconds squared you added them all up it was still milliseconds squared you took the square root of it it's back to milliseconds so rmssd is reported in milliseconds if anybody's been paying attention to wearables a number of these things will calculate your heart rate variability typically while you're sleeping and you'll notice it gives you a number in milliseconds i think prior to the advent of wearables this was typically just done with an ekg or another sort of chest strap like device that was very accurately measuring the electrical activity of the heart the next question is probably why do we measure hrv so you talked about heart rate i think people would understand measuring heart rate and maybe why that matters why you might want a lower heart rate in general why do we measure hrv what does it tell us or what can it tell us possibly as i alluded to above the heart even when your heart rate is not changing and if you're at rest which is when we measure hrv so we don't really measure hrv when you're out and about moving around because just the movement itself that you're undergoing is going to change your heart rate so if i stand up from my desk and go and walk over to the kitchen and do something well that's going to increase my heart rate just because i stood up and if i'm exercising obviously my heart rate is changing quite a bit so this is really something that we care about when you're at rest but as i said there is variability between those beats and it turns out that that variability is heavily influenced by which of the",
