        "text": "it might be that free will or the absence of free will is what determines a person's maybe call it genetic propensity to change habits or form habits there may be some people for whom that is easier than others but that's probably a spectrum and it doesn't imply that a person who struggles with a given behavior can't learn to master it uh just as a you know so again using an example i'll never be a michael phelps like ever right there was no there was no scenario under which i was going to be as good a swimmer as michael phelps so even if he hadn't started swimming until he was 15 and my parents threw me in the water at two i was never going to be that good but it doesn't mean i couldn't learn to swim uh and similarly had he never been thrown in the pool we would never have heard his name so uh i i guess that's how i kind of rationalize it which is there are going to be people for whom it is easier to go through the exercises that we're going to talk about and there are people for whom that's just going to be more difficult and in the end you're sort you can't change that part of it that's the part i guess that is sort of set yeah and i a couple thoughts to add on to that so um i thought of this when you first brought this up a few minutes ago i don't know if you're familiar with david epstein very much sports gene and range and so on so david's great and a good friend of mine a really nice guy and just very thoughtful with the way he puts arguments together which i always appreciate um and i was having a conversation with him about some of this stuff and he said one of the things that surprised him when he was researching the sports gene is that",
