        "text": "up with each decade of life if I had access to that lecture I used to give I could show you what happens but but certainly with each decade of Life your blood pressure goes up on average if you're looking at a population of people is that normal is that part of normal healthy aging or is that just a function of pathology is it a function of something going wrong over time to your point is it's something about decreased kidney function or maybe as an increased vascular stiffness over over time I think all those things are possible and probably probably probable so for a long time it was assumed that a blood pressure that was normal for somebody in their 20s and 30s was probably too low and not normal for somebody who was in their 60s 70s and 80s and so we let had sort of had this permissive hypertension in elderly people because we thought well gosh they required it's just part of the aging process and it really hasn't been until the past really 10 plus years that we've begun to ask specifically in really well-designed clinical trials is that the case and is it the case when it comes to looking at an important clinical outcomes and I think uh you know my take on this now is different than it was 15 years ago and that is that 120 over 80 is normal no matter where you are in life and that anything above that is abnormal and you know just to kind of get to the punch line what I tell patients is that my aspiration is that we can get you as close to 120 over 80 as we can without harming you because there are certainly potential harms that are associated with treating people to these low numbers they can be in the form of side effects or impacts on lifestyle they can be in the form of real toxicity you know hyperkalemia have risk of death",
