        "text": "like thinking about anticipating willingness to engage and that if you didn't separate it you were missing something about what could be a problem for someone like so that 35 year old or that 39 year old we're talking about I think she's 41 now but yeah no we made it because our kids were I wasn't letting her have kids at 25 but okay good point her kids if you said they were 10 and 12 I made I was just trying to be realistic um the other thing is I I feel like it it comes up in that like the if it's not late reproductive post-menopausal it's like 38 to 41. I don't know why but I hear that a lot those there's sort of time for frames that come up I we can talk about why that one is but that's why I picked it um but she might say to me like you know I'm exhausted I have these kids I have this job but I um agree and I I'm like and I'm always kind of like it's still even to this day surprised to hear but you know I said you get turned on well yeah I mean I feel feels fine I do have an orgasm oh yeah yeah and is that satisfying yeah but I don't want sex you know so they that if you get rid of the idea that desire is separate you miss that right right um and I think you know there's a lot of variation on that we could talk about a different patient where they say like theoretically I really want to be with this person but I know that like things aren't going to work I'm not going to feel anything I'm not going to get wet I'm going to have pain so that like then I I avoid right and then I don't want because of that reason like there's variations on that so it's really helpful to keep these Concepts separate right yes um there's some work coming out I don't know if you want to get into this it's come out over the last decade actually in some sort of lay press books that are smooshing them together saying that",
