        "text": "last thing on Ed I wanted to talk to you about is this device that a couple of my patients have talked about I think it's called gainswave sure what is it so gainswave is just a company uh but that uses devices for Shockwave therapy okay so I just have to give you a little bit of history about Shockwave therapy in 2010 Dr vardy European study was the first to start using shock waves to treat Ed and you shock waves are not new to urologists we use high intensity Shockwave for kidney stones right yes it's called high intensity shock wave this is called low intensity Shockwave therapy or list right and when I first saw that I'll be honest with you I thought it didn't make a lot of sense I said this is ridiculous he's shocking the penis two to three times a week three weeks 2500 shocks what is he doing but the science is actually quite clever the science is you're inducing trauma when you induce trauma you bring in neoangiogenesis right you actually recruit stem cells right you help with nitric oxide synthase so it actually is helping improve the condition we weren't the first cardiologists have been doing it for years if you look at cardiologists they were shocking the heart and they look at the reperfusion and it was reperfusing the heart Orthopedics to it for uh joints and they use it for plantar fasciitis and it's used for a lot of conditions but this was shocking the penis in 2010. so since then and again pardon my ignorance how is the device applied so it is think of it like a probe and what happens you have to have someone doing performing the procedure we divide the penis in six zones so it's shaft hilum and cruise and in in two sides so six zones and we will typically and sort of just explain where each of those is so the hilum is the shaft is obviously the shaft of the penis the hilum is where the at the base of the penis and the cruises underneath the scrotum okay",
