        "text": "so on ascbd i've also become far more aggressive on the timing and magnitude of apob reduction so now the question becomes well when should you start apob reduction and how much should you lower it and i'll tell you i used to take a point of view that if a 40 year old had an elevated apo b let's just put some numbers to this right so the 20th percentile of apob is about 80 milligrams per deciliter i used to say that let's say somebody was at the 50th percentile they're 40 years old their calcium score is zero and they were ambivalent about lipid lowering therapy and let's assume that they're not insulin resistant and you've done all the things that you can do reasonably with nutrition i wouldn't push that hard i've now taken a very different stand which is i've basically taken the stand with others that i've taken with myself which is the evidence is overwhelming that infantile levels of apob are not deleterious in any way meaning an apob of 30 to 40 milligrams per deciliter which is the level that children would have poses not only no risk to children as evidenced by the fact that i mean that doesn't require an explanation but as evidenced by what we see in the literature on adults with levels that have been pharmacologically reduced tells me that we need to be lower and the amount of time it takes to see a benefit tells me we don't want to wait until there's an issue in other words if the reason we begin therapy is because somebody has a positive calcium score which again we covered this in great detail in is that ama come out yet i was just gonna say that ama will be released two",
