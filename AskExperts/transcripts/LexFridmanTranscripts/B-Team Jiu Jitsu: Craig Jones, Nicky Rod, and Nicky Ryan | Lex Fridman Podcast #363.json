(soft chuckling) That really gets me over the line. - What are the rules in the streets? - Do you think, if you're on steroids, you would've finished the choke? - I mean, for sure. - Who knew that the cure, to the Dagestani Wrestling, were the Aussies? - The following is a conversation with Craig Jones, Nicky Rod and Nicky Ryan. Who together with Ethan Cranston, and others make up the B-Team, a legendary jiu-jitsu team here in Austin, Texas. It was formed after the so-called Danaher Death Squad. The team headed by John Danaher split up into New Wave Jiu-Jitsu and B-Team Jiu-Jitsu.",

And I, as a practitioner and fan of grappling, jiu-jitsu, and martial arts in general, am here for it. To see the best grapplers in history go at it both on the mat and on Instagram. I like the people on both teams, and train with both. And am really happy to see the exciting rapid evolution of the sport that these athletes and coaches are catalyzing. This is, The Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Craig Jones, Nicky Rod, and Nicky Ryan. Craig, can you introduce everyone? - Yep. So, we got Nicky Rod here. Brown belt, two-time ADCC silver medalist. Nicky Ryan, here. That's it. (laughter) - Okay. Who are you? - And I'm Craig Jones. Also, two-time ADCC silver medalist. - Silver medalist. So, the number one loser. - Number one loser. - And maybe a little bit more, your bio says, \"Widely known as the black belt slayer, hails from New Jersey, the land of pizza and biceps.\" - Ah, yes. That's pretty accurate. - Okay. You also do carry a gun on you a lot? - Yeah. I keep it loaded, you know? - Yeah. - Keep it on me. - Uh huh. - Do you have one today? - Uh, in the car. - That was a mistake. That was your first mistake. - Yeah, I think you're too close.

Let's just get out some introductory questions. What in general, accomplishment of the things you mentioned are you most proud of? - I mean, I'm proud just to not have to work a full-time job just to get by on the bullshit I've done so far. - Yeah. - Honestly. - [Lex] Just making money of a thing you love. - Exactly, yeah. - When was the first time you made money on a thing you love? - Oh, probably a jiu-jitsu tournament. I think maybe in Abu Dhabi where I won a thousand dollars. Thought I was rich. - Yeah, yeah. What'd you spend a thousand dollars on? - Probably something bad? Probably drugs or something at the time. Maybe blew it at the after party. (light chuckling) - That's a good introduction to Craig. So, what about you? When's the first time you made money on jiu-jitsu? Or, what's-- Actually, stepping back, like, what's the thing you're most proud of? Is it a similar kind of thing? - I think I'm most proud of is, I mean, for sure two ADCC silver medals, which hurts cause you're so close to getting that gold. But, you know, it takes time. I'm understanding that, you know, the sport of jiu-jitsu takes quite a while to be at the tip top to be the absolute best. So, and I'm just being consistent in my training and my craft and, you know, I'll get that number one spot one day. - What failure or loss is the most painful to you? - I don't know. I have probably a pretty short term memory. So my losses, I just like, I'll just forget about 'em. Yeah, I mean, for sure my loss at this past ADCC in the finals, you know, that one stung a bit,",

I mean, like, it takes a while to produce the skills or the reactions more so, that you need to have to be, you know, to be that number one pound for pound guy. And, you know, pre-ADCC, I was coming off of injury so it took me a little bit to find the right mentality and physicality that I needed in order to, you know, get the wins that required gold. So yeah, it's just a process. - Interesting. You keep saying process, like it takes a while to build up. So, you're not like thinking of a loss, like ADCC as like a specific failure. You haven't gone long enough in a particular process to being a champ. - Well, I mean, for me, I'm closing in on five years of specifically jiu-jitsu training. I'm at about four and a half right now. And yeah, it's just the, you constantly have these ups and downs in training where like, as long as you stay consistent, you'll have a gradual raise. But you know, it's still, you'll have these peaks and lows. And you know, just trying to get better every day. I'm definitely not where I will be in a few years from now, but I'm striving to get there. - Are you actually a brown belt? Or was that a joke? - Brown belt, yeah. - You're a brown belt. Like how many stripes? - No stripes. - No stripes. Okay. - Stripeless. - Okay. Is that part of the process, that you're working through? - Definitely part of the process. I mean, I think a black belt is just based upon how much knowledge you have. Obviously, like, you know, if you're talking competitive wise, like from when I started, I was able to beat most black belts. That's just kind of how I was gifted from my wrestling experience.

Or like, how much does it come into play into-- - Yeah, I mean it's like Nicky Rod said, you know, it's based off of knowledge, not just, you know, what you do out on the competition mats. Cause you know, like he said, he had years of wrestling experience, and obviously he's very physically gifted. So, we grade based off of the amount of knowledge that you have. - Like, how do you measure knowledge? - I think teaching is a good measurement of it. Like, how well you're able to show the moves, and you know, really make sure that you have an understanding of what you're doing. - Yeah. It's an interesting rank. It's like, it's something that takes many years to accomplish, and for a lot of people it's truly meaningful. It's like it represents a particular step in a journey. But for you guys, it's almost like different, because you've been so focused on competition that I guess if you take it seriously, it is a big step for you too, like as martial artists, that's bigger than just being like top of the world competitors, right? So, I thought it was a joke. You guys are actually taking it seriously. Like-- - That he's a brown belt. - That he's a brown belt and he's, and you're taken seriously, the rank of black belt and like, it's part of your journey. - I think by the time I get a black belt, I'll be no more pound for a pound. I think it'd be pretty nice to accomplish that as a brown belt and then maybe toss a black belt on top. - Maybe get promoted on the podium.

One of the things I really love is at the end of the match when they lose they just, there's no, they just run off. - Yeah. - They're like almost pissed off. It's like some mixture of anger and frustration at themselves. - I think sometimes that people like freak out on the mat. And I think that's just to show everybody, like, they're acting like they cared a lot. And really maybe they didn't work enough to you know, get to where they want to, where they expected to be.

I do think it's something that's kind of held me back over the past few years cause, it makes it so that I'm not as active as I should be. Cause it's like I really hate that feeling of, you know, after a match that you just lost. So, it kind of prevents me from competing. So, it's definitely something I need to work past. - So, like when you think about a competition, the possibility of losing, which is always there in competition, is the thing that like weighs heavy on you in the months and weeks leading up to it? - Yeah, my whole life, you know, my financial stability, everything depends on, you know, my ability to go out there and compete, and my ability to teach. So, you know, it's a huge hit to the brand if you lose. So, you know, leading up to matches.

It's too easy sometimes to like think about, oh my girls in the crowd and my family's watching. Like, I wanna win cause they're there. But at the highest level, if you're emotional at all, that's affecting you. - Yeah. That's tough though. (lightly chuckles) That's tough. Especially like leading up to when you're on the map maybe, but leading up to it. - I think it's okay to be emotional prior. Like, you know, if we know ADCC or it's coming up and we have a big match, like definitely I'll go out and practice, and I'll visualize, I'll put myself in that competition. That way when it's game time, it's like, I've been there a thousand times already. - So, not the actual competition, but even leading up to it, like stepping on the mat, like all the walk, walk towards it, all that. - All that stuff.

Like, how do you prepare mentally for tournament like ADCC? - I push it completely outta my mind. Don't even think about it. Try to avoid any visualization, any rituals, warmups, anything like that. Block it out until the last second. Yeah. Try not to think about it. I just kinda train to have fun, learn a bit. So, I try to approach competition the exact same way. I don't warm up in training,",

And there were like four locker rooms, and they put me with all the DDS guys. It was just me and all of DDS. And I think we had competed the weekend before. So, I thought it was gonna be super awkward, but it was actually, it was actually pretty chill. And the Kasai was in New York, and they suggested to come train that week.

Is there a part of you that, you know, finds it heartbreaking that DDS split up? Does part of you miss working with John and everybody? Can you steal me on the case for that? - I mean, I miss certain aspects of it, but I also do prefer the freedom of being apart from it. It's obviously a very strict regime under John Danaher. You know, obviously there's parts of it. I miss the parts that the public doesn't see of John, the behind the scenes banter. I feel like he's very conscious of the imagery he portrays to the world. But basically, closed doors, he's always making jokes, always finding, I guess, more in line with the Australian Kiwi sort of culture. But you don't really see that in the public eye. So that perspective, I do miss that relationship with John. In terms of setting aside personal differences, Gordon was a good training partner. Definitely a good training partner to train with. But obviously, the negative things we can't really talk about outweighed all of those things.

Clayton, New Jersey specifically, but Gloucester County. Yeah. So, it was about 130 miles. And without traffic, it was about two and a half hours or so. But on the way back, man, we, it'd be three plus sometimes, you know, you're catching that rush hour. - What year was this? Do you remember? - This was in 2018. - I forget how young you are. I was there before, before all that. All right, cool. Anyway, you're doing the long drive and then what? - Yeah, doing the long drive and then, you know, once I won ADCC trials, I was able to make a couple bucks. And then, you know, I got my silver medal at ADCC, and I was able to afford to live up there in New York, in north Jersey area. So I lived up there, trained there full-time every day and you know, just kind of stuck with the team throughout the turbulent times and found ourself in Austin. - In the jungle. - In the jungle, yeah. - One of the things we shall not speak of. What, are there things that you remember that you've learned from John Danaher from your time you spent with him? - Yeah, I mean I definitely learned a ton from John",

And once I became a bit more verbal with my training and you know, I'm showing, I'm expressing all my curiosities about grappling to these guys definitely helped boost my technique and my career as a whole. - Yeah. Did you understand what kind of stuff, like technically you want to get good at, what fits your body? What, like, what would be good for you? What are your weaknesses and all that? - So initially, and when I started grappling, I had an innate ability to just get to opponents back. So I was like, all right, I'm good at getting to the back. Let me perfect controlling the back and then submitting opponent via rear naked choke. And then besides that, I really focus on leg lock defense, and then eventually came the Rody lock pass where, you know, I'm really good at body lock passing my opponents now. And yeah, just takes a quite a long time, cause you have to find different sequences, and then there's always these an abundance of opportunities that your opponent gets from these specific sequences. So, takes a while.

And, I really just went into training just as like a means to exercise and lose weight at the beginning, cause I was pretty fat as a kid. So, I went to the first class, loved it.

And, you know, I just absolutely loved it. I knew what I wanted to do with my life at a young age. So, I ended up dropping outta school actually, after my freshman year in high school. So yeah, 15 I ended up dropping out and just pursuing jiu-jitsu full-time.

What do you mean broke? Which part breaks in a toe hold? - Okay, so in a toe hold there's a few different grades of it. Like you could get a few pops and have some, you know, walking issues. And people consider that a break. And then you could break it fully and have your foot be like a limp noodle, you know? I think what are those? Achilles? Is it was the front of the Achilles or something? - I mean, probably the ligaments. I mean it's funny like, a lot of people say they broke something. But like to me, you break bones, you tear ligaments. So I would imagine, you probably had a grade three tear. - Grade three. - How hard do you think is it to, I always wondered that with like a straight foot lock, how hard is it to break the shin, or like the actual bones versus the tear stuff? - Depends how many steroids they're on.

Let's see, trying to hang. Oh, okay. I go with defense first. Whistle blows, I'm able to escape in like 17 seconds. And then immediately after, I go on his back, and he gets out in exactly 17 seconds. I'm like, shit, all right. I thought I had a good start. And then he gets on my back right after that, and he's able to ride me out for pretty much the entire round. After that, I got back on his back, he escapes in maybe like a minute and some change. I think where I went wrong in the overtime is I should've been less adamant about chasing the submission, and more aware of collecting time. If I kind of diverted my attention towards acquiring, you know, time on the clock, it would've been, you know, more of my favor. But yeah, at the end of my overtime round I'm able to lock up rear naked choke over the face, but there just wasn't enough time to fully finish. You know, I got a few seconds of squeeze in there.

And the task is to escape, and then the other person gets the same thing. What do you guys think about that rule set? - I like it just because... First of all, I don't like the idea of having to put somebody on my back, but I do like the definitive answer in the match. Like, either you escaped in time or you got, you know, written out. So the absolutely, like you have a, you get to the final winner. That's great. I'd much rather have that than a close decision and it kind of goes the other way. - What about you? - I mean honestly, there's all the different roles. When I look at the role sets, I just try to think of what role set I could beat that individual in. And I sort of gear myself towards that. That's really the strategy there. I think there's some guys that like, that stall a lot, that you would love to have EBI overtime with at the end. You know, they're stalling until they have to give us a good position.

You know, people find it very entertaining to watch. You know, cause people wanna see submissions and you're putting people, - [Lex] Yeah. - Yqou're putting the athletes in a position where you know, you have like the highest percentage submission in the sport. So obviously, you're gonna get a lot of submissions. My issue with it is, it is a rule set that allows somebody that's overall worse at jiu-jitsu to win a match. You know, a guy can go out there and just stall and just get completely dominated for the entirety of regulation, and then he gets to start on the guy's back. So, that's my one issue with it. - But also, I mean isn't it interesting to see, like the best people in the world have to be put in a really bad position?

And it would of course be in the-- - Something interesting about Gordon, he's the first author that's written more books than he's read. - Pretty good. (laughter) If you face him and beat him, what's your take on what it takes to beat Gordon? I mean, you guys are kind of joking, they go pretty hard recently on each other.

He's looking for a large insult in a small insult. And for me, like Australians, we just attack each other, all day, every day. And for me, like if I see someone that takes himself very seriously, that's like blood in the water. That's funny to me. To me, if I can just gently provoke and get a strong reaction, that's hilarious. Like Aussies, we'll just attack each other, and the first person that gets upset, he kind of loses the exchange. So, I think that is very, very entertaining. - Like if you were to beat Gordon, would the mental game off the map be part of it? - I think it would be a factor for sure. But I mean, I'm never gonna come out too crazy direct with him. You know? Like I don't, I can't, I find that like if you get too upset online and you're going crazy, I find that-- I'd be embarrassed to do that myself. Obviously, everyone's different. Everyone has a different style, you know? But like, yeah, I think mental, the mental aspect would play a big factor. I mean, mainly because if I were to beat him, I would send him a message every day until I died. - [Lex] Yeah. - Just to gently remind him that I got the last one. The last one. It's all that matters. We're not keeping score here. - Win it back. - Yeah, we're not keeping score. - So like, once you beat him, you're going to run for the rest of your life. - I mean run, but look back. - Yeah. - You know?

Do they really? - No. (laughter) - Oh, I was waitin' for you. Oh, sorry. I'm slow. I'm way too aggressive mode in my head. - Now honestly, - [Lex] Half listening to you. - Islam is pretty cool. I wanted to stir it up a bit, you know? Cause like I felt like that was a massive fight and it probably should have added more attention than it was receiving. So, I wanted to just gently stir it up a bit. I feel like Sambo guys are in the same lane as catch wrestlers. Very sensitive. You know, like obviously, there's only three people in the world that do catch wrestling. Sambo, maybe 10 to 15. So, I figured we could really provoke them with that sort of jiu-jitsu sambo stuff. Islams took the jokes very well. The Russian fans not so much. They're very serious. There's not many smiles in Russia, you know? They didn't take it as well. - I'm trying to suppress the anger. The rage is building inside me, slowly. So, you guys mentioned steroids. - I like that you bring that up after we talk about Russia. For the record.

I'm always a little bit, I don't know, so I'll be honest, I've never seen anyone take steroids. I've never taken steroids. I don't even know if that's the right term to use or like TRT, any of that. So, I'm very careful like, to not let my naivete like, lead me to take conclusions. But, I do feel a little bit weird about the witch hunt nature of it. That some people a little bit too eagerly claim that others are on steroids just because they're successful. But at the same time, it does seem that a lot of athletes will do whatever it takes to be successful. - Yeah, I mean if a sport doesn't test, you gotta assume most people are gonna do it. And especially now, as more money comes into the sport, you gotta assume more people are gonna do it, you know? - But generally, like, do ADCC and like, does jiu-jitsu test? - [Craig] It's actually encouraged. - What's encouraged? - No, I'm kidding. - You get a pamphlet. Okay. They don't test? There's no testing? - They test to make sure we're on steroids cause obviously it's a big show for the UFC five plus in the future.

Because obviously, you know, testosterone helps with recovery rate. So if you're on gear, you're able to train a lot more. Now with that being said, if you're not able to learn, obviously it's not gonna help in that aspect.

And I think, trying to teach those guys real specific positions, even like real specific types of guard, is just beyond them. I think the best way to learn is through problem solving. And I think if you show the technique before they've discovered that problem, the learning is sort of held back. So, I like the idea of using kids style games to show them a problem and then use the techniques to fix the problems they've just discovered. I think that's the best way to learn. - Can you give an example of a problem to show them before you give them the techniques?

But the rules, the constraint would be one guy is forced to keep upper posture and one guy is forced, well not forced, but he's allowed to keep a bent of the hips, lower posture. And obviously within that constraint, the guy with the better posture is going to have more success. He's gonna have a better posture to secure a leg or secure both legs, and therefore, you've demonstrated the flaws of bad posture without having to explain it to 'em before they really tested that out. - Okay. And then the result of that you would realize that the bent over posture is better. - Yeah, you have that Aha moment rather than just being having been spoken to. - You wrote Craig, \"I'm a big fan of constraint based learning,\" I guess, was what you're talking about.",

Then I see how the guy got out and address issue by issue. Crossface and hemp control and so on. Okay, so what are some other examples? Like side control? - Yeah, that would be an excellent one, side control. Like obviously, we say oh you secure a crossface so they can't turn into you. Much easier to have them try to hold someone down without explaining what a crossface is, and then use that technique to address the problem they've just encountered. So, I think you could do that with a lot of areas of jiu-jitsu. Like even more advanced, say 50/50, obviously a mirrored position where you both have access to each other's heels. Most people will stall out in that position and keep their feet crossed. I think a great constraint for both of them, you can't cross your feet. Now, you have to learn how to slip the heel hook when they expose it, and how to safely re-attack of your own. So, the constraint is you can't be too defensive in that position. And I think the rate of learning increases. - Why do you think the rate of learning increases? Like, why do you think that works? - Because you encounter more problems. Say in that situation, they're gonna get you heal a lot more in whatever period of time you allocate the drill for than if the legs are crossed. I don't think the hard part's splitting the legs to get to the submission. I think the hard part's practicing control while they're trying to slip it at a later stage. And then obviously, trying to slip your heel when you're in more danger. So, it makes you more comfortable in that bad position, if you're used to doing it with open legs. - Yeah, I think that probably that style of teaching forces people to focus on. Cause it's so easy to fall into focusing and like memorizing a particular details of a technique without thinking like, why the hell does this even work? - [Craig] Exactly, yeah. - And if you don't have that,",

Which is kind of interesting cause it's not obvious to me that bent over posture is the right posture for jiu-jitsu, right? I'm confused actually about that. I don't know. - [Craig] About the correct posture? - Yeah, for jiu-jitsu. Like, what's the right answer? - I think bent over posture's still good for jiu-jitsu. - Even with the judo and all of that. Like, why are so many jiu-jitsu people, like at a high level, the posture is higher up? - Well, I think wrestling posture is just a bit too low because it's not necessary, right? If wrestlers are like low enough to the ground where your hands could touch the mat. But in jiu-jitsu, you know, it's kind of a mix between like wrestling and like, judo or Greco-Roman wrestling. So, I think it's just a bit more lax, and it's bent over but it's not upright. And it's also not super low, you know? - Bit more room for error too, because obviously the jiu-jitsu guy's shot isn't gonna be as athletic or as quick as a wrestler, especially a wrestler who shoots. - So, it actually comes down to the fact that jiu-jitsu people just on average, even at the top level, are not good at shooting. - I think so, yeah. I think obviously, I mean, all the wrestlers in America and stuff, they're starting super early, super young. You know what I mean? By the time they get to the same age we are really, in our sport and stuff, they've spent much longer doing the actual sport than the average jiu-jitsu guy. - And then there's another level of wrestling of course, with the Soviet block,",

Hickman was down there too, one of the Hickman brother's wrestling coach. So, we were sort of like, problem solving and I mean basically, we were confident in Volk's fence wrestling, his cage work. He's super good on the cage, super like, under respected in that position. And we knew that if you were able to take the scrambles to the cage, he would be effective against Islam. Cause again, Islam is background in Sambo of freestyle wrestling. But I mean, honestly, he's probably got the same experience on the cage as Volks. Obviously, some of those wrestling skills will translate very well to the cage, but the cage is still somewhat of a gray area, an equalizer. And Volks, again, incredible ability to stand up. Incredible defense on the cage, which you saw. We worked on strategies to get up, and a ton of submission defense. Islam loves Kimuras, obviously rear naked from the back, arm bars, those are sort of-- And arm triangles dominant submissions. But again, the guys he submitted, not grapplers.

So, we didn't even come into it thinking Islam was this unstoppable boogeyman that people make him out to be. So, we approached it from that, just focused on the techniques, ability to get back up, using turtle to get back up. Using turtle to scoot to the cage to get back up, and hand fighting from there.

But, - [Lex] Okay. - They break guys mentally. And they fatigue 'em, and then they take the submission that's offered.

I think jiu-jitsu's a terrible way to get back to the feet because if you were to retain guard and go half guard or closed guard, super hard positions to get up, you're basically putting yourself in a leg tuck for wrestling.

So, I think it's a bit more efficient passing from the top as opposed to sweeping from bottom. - Bottom's reactive, top is active. The top player decides how to engage, how to approach the guy. They can use angles, they can use footwork, they can throw people, throw the legs by. So, it's an active position. Bottom's reactive.

(chuckles) (Lex chuckles) Put in a good word for me. - Oh, oh I will. Yeah. (laughter) - That's right. He takes a joke pretty well. - [Lex] Yeah. - No, you'll be welcome with open arms. (Craig laughs) - I think your average jiu-jitsu coach, MMA fighters have bad experience with jiu-jitsu guys. Jiu-jitsu doesn't have a massive place in MMA. Obviously, rounds, standups. It's hard to submit people. Your average Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt doesn't know anything about holding a guy down, doesn't know anything about how to stand up. - [Lex] Sure. - So, I think if you over overly utilize that jiu-jitsu guy, that hasn't had experience in more modern No-Gi, or training MMA fighters previously, it's gonna be a complete waste of time to 'em. I think they're smart enough to realize that. - Do you have, and do you guys, do you have interest in MMA at all? Just not even like, well certainly, just competing yourself. But like, just understanding the puzzle of MMA? - Yeah, I mean, I've been a fan of mixed martial arts, you know, for a very long time before I trained jits. Personally, I'd much rather coach than fight. But I mean, I'd fight somebody for,",

(laughter) Who do you think is the greatest MMA fighter of all time? Craig, we can start with you. Just as a fan of the sport, as somebody who's been deep in it. - I mean, from my perspective, after that performance, I'm gonna say Volkanovski because he was able to decisively outstrike Max Holloway, one of the greatest strikers in the sport. - [Lex] Yeah. - [Craig] And he was able to hang with the wrestling of Islam Makhachev. And in terms of Ortega, he was able to survive Ortega, who has some of the most dangerous submissions in jiu-jitsu. So, I think in my opinion, technically, he's the best. - So even though, he technically lost, he still has a crown. - [Craig] I believe so. - Proven himself, - Given the size difference, given he's moving up in weight. - [Lex] Yeah. - I think all those factors really. - The underdog, everything, the pressure. - Did you think he would be able to hang in any of the wrestling exchanges with Islam? - No, no, no. I was really surprised. That's why my eyes like, it's kind of funny. Like, winning at the end of the day, I feel like judges influenced that. Although, I did think Australian judges would, would rob the other way. (chuckling) But I was assuming they kind of, somebody paid somebody and not enough maybe. But in general, I just thought he won sort of in the eyes of what martial arts stands for. Like, sort of go to the fire and survive and thrive. And finish the last round strong, which is kind of was like spiritually is what a victory is. So, I wish we kept going like. - [Craig] One more rounds. - Yeah, exactly.",

Like, who do you think is the greatest of all time? - I think the fighter I paid most attention to was John Jones. You know, he has a great ability just to mix the high level striking, high level grappling. Although his, you know, jiu-jitsu by itself isn't, you know, probably isn't like, you know, super high level. But his ability to mix everything together, I would say he's the best. And he's a fellow, you know, heavier guy, heavyweight now. So, it's nice to see, you know, how those guys move at that weight. - And a fellow natural athlete? (soft laughter) See what I did there? All right. What about you, Nicky? - Yeah, if I had to pick a G.O.A.T. I would probably have to say Khabib, just because he was undefeated. And he had a very, you know, high finishing rate. You know, very few of his fights actually went to a decision. - [Lex] Yeah. - So he just, overall, he dominated almost every single opponent he went against. - The dominance. I mean, we've been joking about it, but Craig, what do you think makes the Dagestani fighter so good? Like, from this small region of the world? So, much dominance has come. - I mean obviously, the amount of freestyle wrestling champions from that region probably puts their wrestling above and beyond the best in all of MMA. And obviously, even in the Olympics, a lot of champions outta there, right? So, I think that skillset combines with them adding effective pin controls on the ground and jiu-jitsu submissions. But I mean, again, I think it's that hard training those guys like Khabib, would maintain that pressure throughout the entire fight and break guys down.",

Of what's specific about their training, what's specific about their culture that creates that. Okay. What do you think about like the flip side? Do you admire somebody like Conor McGregor who knows how to create a spectacle? You Craig, who likes spectacles. - Spectacles, yeah. I mean, I really admire early Conor McGregor, cause I found him absolutely hilarious. You know? Like, I felt like that was peak banter. I feel like he just took the American world by storm. Aussies, British, Irish, Kiwis. I believe we have a way better level of banter and attacking each other. And it's almost too easy to pick on Americans to take themselves very seriously.

It's like, it's a bit of, I mean, some things he definitely takes too far, you know? But I felt like early on he had the right balance, where he wouldn't really cross a line but he would do, he would do enough. He just took it to another level, Obviously, later in his career.

And if you're relatively close in technique, then a lot of times, a stronger opponent pulls it out. - But it could be also just a limitation, right? You hold position too long. What about for hobbyists? Do you recommend weightlifting? Like, when you've seen people in the gym? - I always recommend weightlifting. I almost see muscle as the body's armor, right? The more armor you have, the more damage you can kind of take. And, you know, maybe recovery is a little bit better. And I've always seen weightlifting as a means to stick to my routine.

Which is inevitable with playing guard. And I was very hesitant to shoot as well. So, I came out with the idea of just trying to use hand fighting to tire my first opponent out. And then mainly look to get to underhooks or over hooks and do mostly upper body wrestling. In the beginning of the match, I, you know, successfully got to an underhook. I got to a rear body lock, he tried to roll and I ended up in top position and side control. But it was during the no points period.

I'll visualize how I'm gonna get to my most dominant positions. Cause you know, in comp, I wanna do what I'm best at. And also see, I see my opponent in his best positions and how I'm gonna escape those if necessary. But most of the time I'm just visualizing exactly what I'm gonna do in that match. And I go out there and do it. - Okay. So, when your teammate Craig is, you know, another like world class athlete has a fundamentally different philosophy than you, do you visualize being frustrated at him? - No, not frustrated, but I'll definitely come into practice with like solutions to problems that Craig gives me. You know, like if Craig's, you know, catching me a sub or giving me issues like, you know, I'll go home, I'll watch him a match that he lost for motivation and I'll come back and I'll put it on him. (laughter) - Just DM him like a highlight reel of him losing. - Yep. (soft chuckling) What about you? Like, does it affect you that you're a bit of an outlier? - Usually before I compete, or right before I go out there, I go, why am I doing this? - [Lex] Yeah. - Do I still need to do this? - [Lex] Yeah. - And I think, fuck, hopefully I don't embarrass myself affect my instructional sales. That's the last thought. But, I didn't even put too much thought into the whole competing thing.",

The day before, the day of, are there rituals that you follow? - Honestly, like the few days leading up to it, it's different for me every time. Like, sometimes I'll warm up before I compete, sometimes I won't. Sometimes I'll fast, sometimes I'll eat. So I literally, it's just completely random. I don't follow any specific thing. But in the training room leading up to the competition, I'll definitely, you know, like Nicky Rod, visualize that I'm walking out onto the competition mats. You know, I'll pick somebody that's, you know, a similar body type to the person that I'm competing against. And then, you know, we'll start out with some distance between us. We'll come out, smack hands, and you know, act like everything's a real competition. I'll even sometimes have, you know, corners that will yell out times and things like that just to replicate it as much as possible. - That's funny, because I've talked to a lot of Olympic gold medalists.

Sometimes the pressure of taking everything way too seriously can break you. - I mean, I just don't think it's that big a sport really. You know?

I couldn't do that in other sports. - What was the toughest match you've ever had that pushed you mentally, physically, technically? This doesn't have to be the best person you faced. But was there like a moment in your career that was like, really defining for you? - I mean, I would say like the toughest mentally, was just this last ADCC, you know? I just had a big injury leading into it that kind of screwed the whole camp and weight cutting everything up. So yeah, I would say the last ADCC. - Are you proud of your performance there?

What about you, Nicky Rod? - Dude, honestly, most of my toughest matches are in the training room, right? Because I started with these guys, I started training under them like, you know, started training at DDS when I didn't have any knowledge. Like, I knew wrestling, I knew like a knee cut in jiu-jitsu. But like, I started training with them when I knew almost no jiu-jitsu. And then I had to like, you know, really work my way up. So definitely, in the training room, like being, like having one of these guys on my back or like, there's a stretch of like a few weeks or months when Covid first hit and there was just like, four of the best grapplers in the world. And we just did drilling and live rounds with these four guys and it was just, it was hard. It was very hard, you know, every round we're doing six rounds, seven days a week with the best grapplers in the world. And it's like, you get no break, and you're forced to learn on the go. So, I think, for me in the training room, that was definitely my toughest matches. And that's where I built, you know, those mental callouses. - That was a period where I drew with Nicky Rod probably, what, nine months? 12 months? - [Nicky Rod] Yeah. - And typically speaking, like I said, no warmups the first round, we usually take it pretty easy. First round you start in mount. The whole room, the rest of the training room, they take mount very lightly. Me and Nicky Rod would be fighting to the death every day. I felt like we did an extra round every day. It was very grueling-- - I'm very mean when I'm in the midst of drilling or live. Like, we would do, we would drill wrestling, you know, quite a bit, like stand up. And in the drilling, like, I just wouldn't let Craig take me down.

So is that, would that be the hardest versus like live training open like, starting from guard? - I would say mount and turtle definitely, definitely made me very tough. Cause you spent all this effort getting off of bottom mount, and then you gotta get on top of a guy. At the time I'm not that good at holding guys down, so they escape quick and I'm like, fuck, I just tried to hold him down. Gotta go back down. Same thing with a turtle. It's like, you start bottom turtle, you're trying to explode, get out and get away. And then you know, you switch and this guy gets up pretty quick and you're like, damn, I gotta go right back down. It's that constant circle man. It's very tough. But definitely, you know, built some character on the mat. - What do you think is the value of positional training in general in jiu-jitsu? Actually, this one just interacting with you guys. It's not commonly done in just like regular jiu-jitsu gyms. What do you see? Because probably it's not commonly done cause it's so-- Most of the experience is just frustrating. Like, if you're evenly matched, you're basically frustrated the whole time. If you're doing it right. - There's a psychological battle that happens in like the mountain turnarounds. It's like, you know, cause maybe you get close to subbing a guy, or maybe you do sub him, you know, when you start on turtle and you're on their back, you finish 'em and then you get this high point and then immediately you gotta go back down to defensive posture. - Yeah. - And it's very like, it's emotionally like up and down.

So, I think like a lot of, if you're a big fish in a small pond, you don't do positional sparring, you're probably gonna get exposed in competition. You might even look silly in those positions. So, you really have to force yourself to do it despite the fact that you've given someone worse than you a position where they might catch you. So, you have to sort of put the ego aside. - Yeah, that's one one of the things when I was training regularly, of course training with you guys, it's like trivial. But, I didn't work on putting myself in bad positions. When you get better and you regret it. Cause, the big negative thing it has consequence it has on competition is you don't take as many risks, cause you're kind of afraid for your back to get taken. All that kind of stuff. - That was me before I went to DDS. I remember I showed up there in that old position, I was like, fuck this. (laughter) You better earn this position, you know? - [Lex] Yeah, exactly. - I didn't really have escapes. That was a learning curve for me, for sure. - Do you see the value in positional training? Or is it just the source of tremendous frustration? - Yeah, I definitely think it plays a big part in, you know, your confidence when you step out onto the competition mats, you know? Being confident that even if you get put in the worst possible situations, you know what to do and know how to work out of 'em. - So, I had a long argument with Roger Gracie, when you visited and he thinks mount is the most dominant position. Even No-Gi versus Beck. Is there a case to be made for that or no? - I think all of your opponents utensils, their tools are in front of them. So, like if you're on mount, they still have, you know, there's a few ways to get out mount.

Or is he just that good at mount that he says? - He might mean the Gi, cross collar, you know? I don't know. Or did he mean-- - Well, he says controlling-wise. He just believes that you can complete-- That there's, he actually thinks there's more ways to get out from the back than there is from the mount. - Prior to-- - Getting up, including like, physically. - Prior to the keeping escape, I would probably agree with him.

How do you balance that with running a school or being a world class jiu-jitsu athlete? - Oh, me. I mean, the secrets of travel for me are two drugs, Xanax and Modafinil.

Well, what about on the actual mat over training? Like explaining too much time with the mat? - Well, I-- - Like, psychological, physical over training. - I think you can definitely overtrain but it's more of a, like, as your body's healthy, you have to make sure your mind is sharp. Like sometimes, maybe taking a day away or even diverting your attention in a different aspect of training can help you be a little bit sharper overall. Sometimes it can be like, it can get a little like stagnant, cause you're doing the same stuff over and over. But I think if you just keep like, you know, over-training, then your overall baseline just gets higher and you become, you know, accustomed to that. - What about you? You don't seem like a guy that over. - I've heard of it. Never been close to it. Nah, I think controlling how hard you train is definitely protects you from injury, you know what I mean? Like, if you are redlining yourself and then you're fighting to the death in the gym, that's a hundred percent when you're gonna get injured, gonna get sick. So, I try to make sure I've had enough sleep, I've had obviously enough food post-training.

Like, how do you get better? - I think being consistent, like find a schedule that you can consistently train. Maybe it's like, you know, three, four times a week. Or even a little bit less. Just be consistent over the years. I think too often people are like, \"Oh, I wanna get really good really fast.\" And it's like, definitely takes a long time to get to where you wanna be. What about the, what you're doing during, like while being consistent, what kind of stuff you're working on? - So honestly, I think one big thing for me, which I, something I actually started doing once B-Team was formed was filming all of your rounds and then watching it every day.

I think it's just, I mean it just shows like, I mean, I have heard some numbers on the viewership for the Gi World's finals and they don't even compare to the undercard of like, who's number one events. So, I think like when I was coming up and competing in the Gi all the time, you looked at those guys that won black belt championships, and you were like in awe of them. It almost had that ADCC champion feel. But now, that's not the case. You know, I just feel like that the younger generation aren't looking at who's winning black belt Gi Worlds. I personally don't think, and I don't think they're like, they wanna be that guy. They wanna be like a Ruotolo, Gordon. You know, those are the people they wanna emulate. - So, you think like the Gi, like IBJJF Gi tournaments will just keep declining in popularity? - Oh, I think people will still do it. I mean, it's easier I think as you over 30, cause the Gi's a bit of a slower thing and the master's participation is bigger in the Gi. Cause obviously in No-Gi is now heading in a wrestling direction. Wrestling and heel hooks, you're over 30. That's a terrifying prospect, you know? What's terrifying about the Gi?",

Foot sweeps and arm drags. I would say pretty, pretty popular in our sport. - Arm drag. It's just go arm drag to Okay. - Arm drag either to get 'em, like, get to behind them or even just to cause reactions, make them pull away and we can start reattacking. - Are you talking about it in a context of what's the best takedown to score? What's the safest takedown to mitigate the risk of guillotine submission? Or most effective in general? - Yeah, most effective combined. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, hopefully it's about scoring. - I think any sort of body lock, you know what I mean? Locking your hands around the body. You've been able to put 'em to the floor that way.

Even if they don't want attack, put 'em to sleep. But, as far as like something I've been working on now that I'm now starting to implement in competition, Yoko Sankaku's side triangles. Like, it's a beautiful thing. You have multiple options. You have the triangle to finish. If that fails, you have the Kimura, you could break the arm. You could also just transfer and take the back. So, Yoko Sankaku, I'm a big fan of, and I continue to progress and be better at it. - Have you ever broken anyone's arm? - Oh yeah. I mean the first few competitions cause I was like, you know, pretty athletic grappler or athletic wrestler going against local black belts and brown belts. Like, one of my first matches I broke somebody a Kimura. Pretty much every time I've got a heel hook, which is only twice I've broken an opponent. If I have a joint lock, it's probably gonna break. Like a lot of times it breaks before they tap. (Lex chuckles) Yeah. - You seem like a really friendly fella. How hard is it to break an arm or any break a joint? - Well, I don't think it's that hard. I think, like if you're talking about an arm bar, we have this position to where like people are kind of holding on, holding on, and then it slips and their arm starts going. - Sure. - And then it just breaks before they even, you know, get a chance to tap. - I love this sport. - I knee barred a guy and he didn't tap one time.

For sure, have an ego, like if you're training competition mode. But also it can prevent you from learning and progressing if your ego's too high. Like you really have to shut the ego down when you're in the mode of learning and trying to, you know, develop skills. Cause you're gonna put yourself in these bad positions. You're gonna have issues with training partners that aren't necessarily, you know, up to your skill level. But because you're in these bad positions, you have to make these certain sacrifices. And for sure, ego can be a good or bad thing.

Judo? - I think if it's a one-on-one, I'd go, wrestler wins. But, if it's like, you know, it's like a multiple people, you gotta go Muay Thai, stay on their feet. Can't go down to the ground if it's more than one person. - Big double leg maybe.",

Is to win the fight and not go to prison? - I haven't thought of it through that way. (Craig laughs) Yeah, certainly. Yeah. Yeah. Not go, not to kill the person. - We got mutual combat here in Texas, we good. - Is that in Texas? - Mhm. - Do you know what the paperwork for that looks like? Do you have to actually sign something, or can you just say? - I hope I don't need to find out. (Lex chuckles) I did hear a story where guys were on Sixth Street and they looked at a cop. They were like mutual combat, mutual combat. - Yeah. - And just got like the cops to say yes and just duped it out. They could be false though. - That sounds crazy. - [Nicky Rod] I'm saying. - I kind of admire that, but I've also been playing Red Dead Redemption recently. So, I like internalized the cowboy a little too much. Just to return to gym stuff. No, because it's a business. Because you're running a business, there's money involved. But, you're also friends. But, you're also training partners. Is there a tension that money creates that can threaten to destroy friendships? That's something I always worry about with money. I try not to go do any kind of business with friends or family. - I think if you're all very clear and honest and open at the start, makes it much easier. I think people have issues when there's like, kind of like things are written and fine print, and nobody knows the exact answers. - And a lot of jiu-jitsu guys can't read. You know, that makes it challenging as well. - [Lex] We're learning that today. - Yeah. (laughter) - [Lex] Uh, no. - Definitely complicated though. - Yeah I mean, it's not always obvious",

        "text": "how to be transparent and stuff about everything. Have you felt that tension? Because in the jiu-jitsu world, money's not really unlimited. Just running a school. What's that like? Because it's the first time you're running a school, running a gym. - Yeah, I mean it's just constantly updating people about what's going on, what your expectations are. You know what I mean? We've had some problems with coaches who I feel like think the pies bigger than it is. You know what I mean? They feel like maybe we're getting rich out of this, and they're missing out on things. So, it's like even amongst managing staff, that can be challenging too. So yeah, I mean it's a constant work in progress to make. Not only to make sure everyone's happy, But to make sure they're comfortable enough to reach out and tell you they're unhappy. But I feel like those challenges are common amongst any small business. - Still, it sucks. Just to mention, I'm clueless to this. But I'm just now learning this. Somebody I met and talked to and I really like is Isaac. And he just learned because you're also active on Reddit. What's your name on Reddit? John Belushi's mom. - John Belushi. As under cover as possible, you know? - Oh, it's not you. It's actually John Belushi's mom. Right. (chuckles) So, I've done my research, I guess. And I guess you guys had a falling out and have split. I just wanna say that, I don't know the few interactions I've had with him, he's a beautiful human being. So. And that just shows to me, - Visually, maybe not internally. - And sexually, just the experience. No. He's just a kind person. I don't know.",

        "text": "I liked him a lot. Like to me, in a business setting, yeah, tensions are created and it sucks. I don't know. I mean, I suppose money, all the stuff that happened in the jungle aside, probably money had a role to play to create extra tension. Money and egos about like who was the leader, who was not the leader, it's tough. It's tough to manage that kind of stuff. I've seen it happen with jiu-jitsu schools a lot. I don't know exactly what. Cause it's like there's also a hierarchy inside grappling jiu-jitsu schools. Like people that are better or not. There's literally ranks black belt and brown belt. There's like competitors that are better. I mean I don't, it's a weird dynamic in which to operate. Cause like usually, there's more politeness and like humanity layered into the way a company works. But here there's just a bunch of, I mean, it's like violence laid on and on display. Plus money. It's crazy. Is there something you could say to that? Like, how you try to minimize? Or something you want to comment on Isaac? - Yeah, I mean it was unfortunate situation. But it just didn't work out. You know, like, there's gonna be personality clashes. Some people... - I can't imagine anyone having a personality clash with you. - [Craig] With me? - Yeah. - It's hard to imagine. - Yeah, it's surprising. You know, I mean, I don't even know what to say on that. I don't want to touch on it too much, but obviously his expectations about his role in the gym, obviously different from ours. Led to some personality clashes that were sort of unresolvable. You know, some things happen that can't be resolved. You can't fix those things. - [Lex] Yeah. - You know? Obviously, a lesson I hope for both of us. Definitely a lesson for me from a management role to try to address these things sooner.",

        "text": "But also, sometimes I came up in a different time where there was no money, no opportunities. I had to pave that. I had to pave that way totally for myself. Especially coming from Australia. Like, being a professional athlete in jiu-jitsu was not, I think so I had to pave a lot of opportunities for myself. And I feel like sometimes, ohh, I don't know what the right word is. Sometimes people don't appreciate some of the ways you help them. And they just think, feel like almost they deserve or are entitled to certain things. And that is very difficult to manage. But I think again, like we both see the situation different. I do hope he finds a better, a more comfortable place to train. But yeah, obviously I've known him for a long time. Sort of like a brotherly relationship. So, that's gonna really make personal problems a lot worse when you're that close to someone, you know? - I just hated that like I've seen in jiu-jitsu especially, but in other places, where like close friendships were destroyed because of like gym stuff. Like, people running gyms. And as a person who is, in this case just a fan, but like in general, just like a student, it like sucks. - But again, in my position, sometimes I wonder if there really was a friendship or mere opportunity. I have to be careful of that with some people in the sport. Is it a sincere relationship? Or like, I mean it's difficult for me to tell. Or am I means to an end? - Sure. But I think it's actually a trade off because I think a lot of close friendships we have like even relationships we have. Like, when tested, like, can break if they're not properly communicated. Like, some of it could be just misunderstanding for a prolonged period of time. It's not explained to religious. Just like a lack of integrity. It's just like you have to like talk through that shit. Like, just be honest with each other.",

People say that that's something I would enjoy a lot cause my brain is I think natural on MDMA. - I'd recommend it for sure. - [Lex] For sure. All right. - Is that what you did with Gabby? Okay, nevermind. - She drugged me. (laughter) - In general, why is there always seems to be drama in the jiu-jitsu world? Like outside of what's going on here. Or is that just, - I think it's universal to anything. - [Lex] Drama's everywhere? And then drama rises to the surface. - Drama makes the money. - [Lex] Yeah. I wish there was a little bit less. You have a bunch of-- Like, we mentioned some of them. You have a bunch of instructionals out. What are some interesting things that you're looking forward to like exploring in terms of teaching? So, \"Just Stand Up\" is your most recent one, right? Yeah. You also have one called, \"Power Bottom, An Inclusive Modern Approach to the Guard.\" (light chuckling) - [Craig] Yep. Yep. - [Lex] What are some other ones? - [Craig] \"False Reap Allegations\" - \"False Reap Allegations\", yeah. By the way people talk about \"Power Bottom\", again, hilarious title. But they say it's a really good instructional, unlike the guard. - Yeah, I try to at least be innovative, you know? Like, everyone else I feel like's ripping off John and Gordon, putting some sort of slant on that. So, I'm trying to take sort of a different approach. I think you can actively influence the sport with what you release cause people are gonna try to emulate that. So, I think those type of instructionals, \"Just Stand Up\", \"Power Bottom,\"",

Just cause we're bringing out, we've got the white belt program coming in, so I'm trying to develop a fundamentals course along the line of the constraint based learning stuff we were talking about today. Like, a way to approach learning as a beginner to sort of speed up the process a bit and not make it as so technique dense. At least have it a bit more fun. - And focusing in on just like, examples of problems to solve. - Exactly, yeah. Approaching jiu-jitsu, learning that way. Like, I mean, kids learn quick through games. I think adults are capable of that to a certain extent as well. - You're releasing that instructional on pre-match preparation? - Yes. - What other stuff? Do you ever think on a body lock pass? - Yeah, I have a body lock or Rody lock DVD, or instructional. Yeah, I had the pre-match ritual coming out. I also have, I'm filming, \"How to Build Athleticism for Grappling.\" I'm just really trying to capture different angles. Kind of like the same, you know, what Craig's doing. Trying not to do the same thing that everybody else does. You know? There's a ton of wrestling, ton of jiu-jitsu instructionals. - And the steroid results are coming in. - Oh yeah, yeah. More plates, more dates. You know, Derek that runs that, hit me up for a blood panel test, like an impromptu thing. And I did it a few days ago, and I believe the results will come out shortly. - Oh yeah? Do you know the results? - What are you betting on, Lex? - What do you think? It's hard to believe.

I think from the beginning of time, it's been, you know, some kind of war, some kind of battle.
