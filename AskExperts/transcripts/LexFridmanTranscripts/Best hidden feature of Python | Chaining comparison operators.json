        "text": "this is a hidden feature of python that i recently came across the chaining of comparison operators that is not available in almost any mainstream programming language i think it's elegant and intuitive and doesn't make any sense to me why it's not available in most languages so what is it say we assign the values 2 and 3 to x and y and then look at a single statement that includes several comparison operators chained together 1 less than x less than y less than 4 in python this evaluates to true the way python evaluates the statement is the same way that we would intuitively or mathematically look at the statement which is as a chain of binary comparison operators 1 is less than x and x is less than y and y is less than 4 which again evaluates to true now you can use any comparison operator less than greater than less than or equal to greater than or equal to and mix and match them together in a single arbitrarily long chain of comparison operators now if we change the original statement to include a greater than operator is the last comparison then the entire statement returns false because y which is equal to 3 is not greater than 4. and then finally again we can flip the 4 and the y to make the statement return true because all the individual comparisons are true 1 is less than x which is equal to two x is less than four and four is greater than y y being equal to three now this feature is available in a few other languages not many like pearl six or reiku i think it's been her name too not sure how to pronounce it and julia and as shown here it's also a first-class citizen in some functional",
