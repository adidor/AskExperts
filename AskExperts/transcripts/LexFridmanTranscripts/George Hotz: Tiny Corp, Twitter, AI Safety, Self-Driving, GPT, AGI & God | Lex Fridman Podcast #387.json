We end up all staring at that infinite TikTok and forgetting to eat. Maybe it's even more benign than this. Maybe we all just stop reproducing. Now, to be fair, it's probably hard to get all of humanity. - Yeah. The interesting thing about humanity is the diversity in it. - Oh yeah. - Organisms in general. There's a lot of weirdos out there. Two of them are sitting here. - Yeah, I mean, diversity in humanity is- - With due respect. (both chuckling) - I wish I was more weird. - The following is a conversation with George Hotz, his third time on this podcast. He's the founder of comma.ai that seeks to solve autonomous driving and is the founder of a new company called tiny corp that created tinygrad, a neural network framework that is extremely simple with the goal of making it run on any device by any human easily and efficiently. As you know, George also did a large number of fun and amazing things, from hacking the iPhone to recently joining Twitter for a bit as a \"intern\" in quotes, making the case for refactoring the Twitter code base. In general, he's a fascinating engineer and human being, and one of my favorite people to talk to. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's George Hotz. You mentioned something in a stream about the philosophical nature of time. So let's start with the wild question. Do you think time is an illusion? - You know, I sell phone calls to comma for $1,000 and some guy called me and it's $1,000 dollars, you can talk to me for half an hour. And he is like, \"Yeah, okay. So time doesn't exist and I really wanted to share this with you.\" I'm like, \"Oh, what do you mean time doesn't exist?\"",

Is time maybe compressive? - Do you think there is an objective reality or is everything just useful models? Like underneath it all? Is there an actual thing that we're constructing models for? - I don't know. - I was hoping you would know. - I don't think it matters. - I mean, this kinda connects to the models of constructive reality with machine learning. Right? - Sure. - Is it just nice to have useful approximations of the world such that we can do something with it? - So there are things that are real. Column graph complexity is real. - Yeah. - Yeah. - The compressive thing- - Math. - [George] Math is real, yeah. - Should be a T-shirt. - And I think hard things are actually hard. I don't think p equals np. - Ooh, strong words. - Well, I think that's the majority. I do think factoring is in p, but... - I don't think you're the person that follows the majority in all walks of life, so it's good. - For that one, I do. - Yeah. In theoretical computer science, you're one of the sheep. (both chuckling) All right. But to you, time is a useful model. - Sure. - Hmm. What were you talking about on the stream with time, are you made of time? - If I remembered half the things I said on stream. Someday, someone's gonna make a model of all of it and it's gonna come back to haunt me. - Someday soon? - Yeah, probably. - Would that be exciting to you or sad? That there's a George Hotz model? - I mean, the question is when the George Hotz model is better than George Hotz. Like I am declining and the model is growing. - What is the metric by which you measure better or worse in that, if you are competing with yourself? - Maybe you can just play a game where you have the George Hotz answer",

It will hurt more when it's people close to me, but both will be overtaken by the George Hotz model. - It'd be quite painful, right? Loved ones, family members would rather have the model over for Thanksgiving than you. Or like, significant others would rather sext (both chuckling) with the large language model version of you. - Especially when it's fine tuned to their preferences. - Yeah. Well, that's what we're doing in a relationship, right? We're just fine tuning ourselves, but we're inefficient with it, 'cause we're selfish and greedy and so on. A language model is, can fine tune more efficiently, more selflessly. - There's a \"Star Trek Voyager\" episode where Kathryn Janeway lost in the delta quadrant, makes herself a lover on the holodeck. And the lover falls asleep on her arm and he snores a little bit and Janeway edits the program to remove that. And then of course the realization is, \"Wait, this person's terrible.\" It is actually all their nuances and quirks and slight annoyances that make this relationship worthwhile. But I don't think we're gonna realize that until it's too late. - Well, I think a large language model could incorporate the flaws and the quirks and all that kind of stuff. - Just the perfect amount of quirks and flaws to make you charming without crossing the line. - Yeah, yeah. And that's probably a good approximation of the percent of time. The language model should be cranky or an asshole. or jealous or all this kind of stuff. - And of course, it can and it will. But all that difficulty at that point is artificial. There's no more real difficulty. - Okay, what's the difference between real and artificial? - Artificial difficulty is difficulty that's constructed or could be turned off with a knob. Real difficulty is like, you're in the woods",

I mean, maybe you kind of can into the wild when, Alexander Supertramp, he wants to explore something that's never been explored before. But it's the '90s everything's been explored. So he's like, \"Well, I'm just not gonna bring a map.\" I mean, no, you're, you're not exploring. You should have brought a map, dude. You died. There was a bridge a mile from where you were camping. - How does that connect to the metaphor of the knob? - By not bringing the map, you didn't become an explorer, you just smashed the thing. The difficulty is still artificial. - You failed before you started. What if we just don't have access to the knob? - Well, that maybe is even scarier. We already exist in a world of nature and nature has been fine tuned over billions of years. To have humans build something and then throw the knob away in some grand romantic gesture is horrifying. - Do you think of us humans as individuals that are like, born to die or are we just all part of one living organism that is earth that is nature? - I don't think there's a clear line there. I think it's all kinda just fuzzy, I don't know. I mean, I don't think I'm conscious. I don't think I'm anything. I think I'm just a computer program. - So it's all computation? And the thing running in your head is computation. - Everything running in the universe is computation, I think. I believe the extended Church-Turing thesis. - Yeah, but there seems to be an embodiment to your particular computation like there's a consistency. - Well, yeah, but, I mean, models have consistency too. Models that have been RLHF will continually say, like, \"Well how do I murder ethnic minorities?\" \"Oh, well I can't let you do that, Hal.\" There's a consistency to that behavior. - It's all RLHF.

Like you have this consistent set of physics biology, whatever you call the neurons firing. The electrical signals, the mechanical signals, all of that, that seems to stay there. And it contains information, it stores information and that information permeates through time and stays with you. There's like memory that's like sticky. - To be fair, a lot of the models we're building today, even RLHF is nowhere near as complex as the human loss function. - Reinforcement learning with human feedback. - When I talked about will GPT12 be AGI? My answer is no, of course not. I mean, cross-entropy loss is never gonna get you there. You need probably RL in fancy environments in order to get something that would be considered AGI-like. So to ask the question about why, I don't know, it's just some quirk of evolution. I don't think there's anything particularly special about where I ended up, where humans ended up. - So, okay, we have human level intelligence. Would you call that AGI? Whatever we have? AGI? - Look, actually, I don't really even like the word AGI, but general intelligence is defined to be whatever humans have. - Okay. So why can GPT12 not get us to AGI? Can we just like linger on that? - If your loss function is categorical cross-entropy. If your loss function is just try to maximize compression. I have a SoundCloud, I rap and I tried to get ChatGPT to help me write raps. And the raps that it wrote sounded like YouTube comment raps. You can go on any rap beat online and you can see what people put in the comments. And it's the most mid-quality rap you can find. - Is mid good or bad? - Mid is bad. - Mid is bad. - [George] It's like mid, it's like... - Every time I talk to you, I learn new words.

It's not real money.\" - And all of it is a genius meme. That's another interesting one, memes. The humor, the idea, the absurdity encapsulated in a single image and it just propagates virally between all of our brains. I didn't get much sleep last night, so I sound like I'm high. I swear I'm not. Do you think we have ideas or ideas have us? - I think that we're gonna get super scary memes once the AI actually are superhuman. - Ooh, you think AI will generate memes? - Of course. - [Lex] You think it'll make humans laugh? - I think it's worse than that. So, \"Infinite Jest,\" it's introduced in the first 50 pages is about a tape that once you watch it once, you only ever wanna watch that tape. In fact, you wanna watch the tape so much that someone says, \"Okay, here's a hack saw, cut off your pinky and then I'll let you watch the tape again,\" and you'll do it. So we're actually gonna build that, I think. But it's not gonna be one static tape. I think the human brain is too complex to be stuck in one static tape like that. If you look at ant brains, maybe they can be stuck on a static tape. But we're going to build that using generative models. We're going to build the TikTok that you actually can't look away from. - So TikTok is already pretty close there, but the generation is done by humans. The algorithm is just doing their recommendation but if the algorithm is also able to do the generation. - Well, it's a question about how much intelligence is behind it. So the content is being generated by let's say, one humanity worth of intelligence. And you can quantify a humanity. It's x of flops, yada flops.",

Like again, you can't imagine the behaviors of something smarter than you, but a super intelligent, an agent that just dominates your intelligence so much will be able to completely manipulate you. - Is it possible that it won't really manipulate, it'll just move past us? It'll just kinda exist the way water exists or the air exists. - You see? And that's the whole AI safety thing. It's not the machine that's gonna do that. It's other humans using the machine that are gonna do that to you. - Yeah. 'Cause the machine is not interested in hurting humans. - The machine is a machine. But the human gets the machine and there's a lot of humans out there very interested in manipulating you. - Well, let me bring up Eliezer Yudkowsky who recently sat where you're sitting. He thinks that AI will almost surely kill everyone. Do you agree with him or not? - Yes, but maybe for a different reason. - (chuckles) Okay. And then I'll try to get you to find hope or we could find a no to that answer. But why yes? - Okay. Why didn't nuclear weapons kill everyone? - That's a good question. - I think there's an answer. I think it's actually very hard to deploy nuclear weapons tactically. It's very hard to accomplish tactical objectives. Great, I can nuke their country. I have an irradiated pile of rubble.

It's the subjugation and domination of the people. - Okay. So you can't use this strategically, tactically in a war to help gain a military advantage. It's all complete destruction. All right. But there's egos involved. It's still surprising. Still surprising that nobody pressed the big red button. - It's somewhat surprising. But you see, it's the little red button that's gonna be pressed with AI that's gonna... And that's why we die.

Isn't it somehow have a hold, like a stronghold? - Well, what's interesting about everything we build, I think we're going to build super intelligence before we build any sort of robustness in the AI.

If you have a large number, if you have like a hundred million of them. - Let's just focus on them reproducing. Do they have microchips in them? Then do they include a fab? - [Lex] No. - Then how are they gonna reproduce? - Well, it doesn't have to be all on board. They can go to a factory, to a repair shop. - Yeah, but then you're really moving away from robustness. All of life is capable of reproducing without needing to go to a repair shop. Life will continue to reproduce in the complete absence of civilization. Robots will not. So if the AI apocalypse happens, I mean the AI are gonna probably die out.

Reproduction is at the absolute core. The first proto-RNA organisms were capable of reproducing. The silicon stack, despite as far as it's come, is nowhere near being able to reproduce. - Yeah.

I think the large language models are less conscious than a chicken. - When is the last time you've seen a chicken? - In Miami, a couple months ago. - How? No, like a living chicken. - There's living chickens walking around Miami, it's crazy. - Like on the street? - Yeah. - Like, a chicken? - A chicken. - All right.

That's consciousness, isn't it? - If that's the word you want to use to describe it, sure. I'm not gonna deny that that feeling exists. I'm not gonna deny that I experienced that feeling. I guess what I kind of take issue to is that there's some, how does it feel to be a web server? Do 404s hurt? - Not yet. - How would you know what suffering looked like?

And part of being human is being conscious, is having the capacity to suffer, having the capacity to experience this life richly in such a way that AI system can empathize with you and you can empathize with it, or you can project your anthropomorphic sense of what the other entity is experiencing. And an AI model would need to, yeah, to create that experience inside your mind. And it doesn't seem that difficult. - Yeah, but, okay, so here's where it actually gets totally different. When you interact with another human, you can make some assumptions. When you interact with these models, you can't. You can make some assumptions that that other human experiences suffering and pleasure in a pretty similar way that you do. The golden rule applies. With an AI model, this isn't really true. These large language models are good at fooling people because they were trained on a whole bunch of human data and told to mimic it. - Yup.

So one of the reasons to start tiny corp is to challenge NVIDIA. - It's not so much to challenge NVIDIA. Actually, I like NVIDIA it's to make sure power stays decentralized. - And here's computational power. And to you, NVIDIA's locking down the computational power of the world. - If NVIDIA becomes just like 10X better than everything else, you're giving a big advantage to somebody who can secure NVIDIA as a resource. In fact, if Jensen watches this podcast, he may wanna consider this. He may wanna consider making sure his company's not nationalized. - Do you think that's an actual threat? - Oh yes. - No, but there's so much... There's AMD. - Mm-hm. So we have NVIDIA and AMD, great. - But you don't think there's a push towards selling? Like Google selling TPUs or something like this? You don't think there's a push for that? - Have you seen it? Google loves to rent you TPUs. - You can't buy it at Best Buy? - No. So I started work on a chip. I was like, okay, what's it gonna take to make a chip? And my first notions were all completely wrong. About like how you could improve on GPUs. And I'll take this, this is from Jim Keller on your podcast. And this is one of my absolute favorite descriptions of computation. So there's three kinds of computation paradigms that are common in the world today. There's CPUs, and CPUs can do everything. CPUs can do add and multiply.",

And what I mean by they can do them fast is they can do things like branch prediction and speculative execution. And they spend tons of transistors and these super deep reorder buffers in order to make these things fast. Then you have a simpler computation model GPUs. GPUs can't really do compare and branch. I mean they can, but it's horrendously slow. But GPUs can do arbitrary load and store. GPUs can do things like X de-reference Y. So they can fetch from arbitrary pieces of memory. They can fetch from memory that is defined by the contents of the data. The third model of computation is DSPs. And DSPs are just add and multiply. They can do loads and stores, but only static load in stores. Only loads in stores that are known before the program runs. And you look at neural networks today and 95% of neural networks are all the DSP paradigm. They are just statically scheduled adds and multiplies. So tinygrad really took this idea and I'm still working on it to extend this as far as possible. Every stage of the stack has Turing completeness. Python has Turing completeness. And then we take Python, we go into C++ which is Turing complete. And then maybe C++ calls into some CUDA kernels, which are Turing complete. The CUDA kernels go through LVM, which is Turing complete, into PTX, which is Turing complete, into SAS, which is Turing complete on a Turing complete processor. I wanna get Turing completeness outta the stack entirely. Because once you get rid of turn completeness, you can reason about things. Rice theorem and the Halting problem do not apply to ADMO machines. - Okay. What's the power and the value of getting Turing completeness out of... Are we talking about the hardware or the software? - Every layer of the stack. - Every layer.",

So the reason you need to do branch prediction in a CPU and the reason it's prediction, and the branch predictors are, I think, they're like 99% on CPUs. Why do they get 1% of them wrong? Well, they get 1% wrong because you can't know. That's the halting problem. It's equivalent to the halting problem to say whether a branch is gonna be taken or not. I can show that, but the ADMO machine, the neural network runs the identical compute every time. The only thing that changes is the data. So, when you realize this, you think about, okay, how can we build a computer and how can we build a stack that takes maximal advantage of this idea? So what makes tinygrad different from other neural network libraries is it does not have a primitive operator even for matrix multiplication. And this is every single one. They even have primitive operation interest, things like convolutions. - So no mat mul. - No mat mul. Well here's what a mat mul is. So I'll use my hands to talk here. So if you think about a cube, and I put my two matrices that I'm multiplying on two faces of the cube, you can think about the matrix multiply as the n cubed. I'm gonna multiply for each one in the cubed. And then I'm gonna do a sum, which is a reduce up to here to the third phase of the cube. And that's your multiplied matrix. So what a matrix multiply is, is a bunch of shape operations. A bunch of per three shapes and expands on the two matrices, A multiply, n cubed, a reduce, n cubed, which gives you an ns squared matrix. - What is the minimum number of operations that can accomplish that if you don't have mat mul as a primitive? - So tinygrad has about 20.

It's 10x less than XLA or PrimTorch. And you can think about it as kind of like RISC versus CISC. These other things are CISC-like systems. tinygrad is RISC. - And RISC one. - RISC architecture is gonna change everything. 1995 hackers. - Wait, really? That's an actual thing? - Angelina Jolie delivers the line RISC architecture is gonna change everything in 1995. And here we are with ARM in the phones and ARM everywhere. - Wow. I love it when movies actually have real things in them. Okay, interesting. So you're thinking of this as the risk architecture of ML stack. 25. Can you go through the four op types? - Sure. Okay. So you have Unary ops which take in a tensor and return a tensor of the same size and do some unary op to it. X, log, reciprocal sine. They take in one and they're point wise. - ReLU. - Yeah, ReLU. Almost all activation functions are unary ops. Some combinations of unary ops together is still a unary op. Then you have binary ops. Binary ops are like pointwise edition, multiplication, division, compare. It takes in two tensors of equal size and outputs one tensor. Then you have reduce ops. Reduce ops will like take a three-dimensional tensor and turn it into a two-dimensional tensor or a three-dimensional tensor turn into zero dimensional tensor. Think like a sum or a max are really common ones there. And then the fourth type is movement ops. And movement ops are different from the other types because they don't actually require computation. They require different ways to look at memory. So that includes reshapes, permutes, expands, flips. Those are the main ones probably.",

Dilated convolutions, strated convolutions, transposed convolutions. - You're right on GitHub about laziness showing a mat mul. Matrix multiplication. See how despite the style, it is fused into one kernel with the power of laziness. Can you elaborate on this power of laziness? - Sure, so if you type in PyTorch A times B plus C, what this is going to do is it's going to first multiply, add and B, A and B and store that result into memory. And then it is going to add C by reading that result from reading C from memory, and writing that out to memory. There is way more loads in stores to memory than you need there. If you don't actually do A times B as soon as you see it, if you wait until the user actually realizes that tensor until the laziness actually resolves, you can fuse that plus C. It's the same way Haskell works. - So what's the process of porting a model into tinygrad? - So tinygrad's front end looks very similar to PyTorch. I probably could make a perfect or pretty close to perfect interop layer if I really wanted to. I think that there's some things that are nicer about tiny grad syntax than PyTorch. But the front end looks very Torch-like. You can also load in Onyx models. We have more onyx tests passing than kernel. We'll pass Onyx around time soon. - Well what about like the developer experience with tiny grad? What it feels like versus PyTorch? - By the way, I really like PyTorch. I think that it's actually a very good piece of software. I think that they've made a few different tradeoffs. And these different tradeoffs are where tinygrad takes a different path. One of the biggest differences is it's really easy to see the kernels that are actually being sent to the GPU. If you run PyTorch on the GPU, you like do some operation and you don't know what kernels ran, you don't know how many kernels ran, you don't know how many flops were used. You don't know how much memory accesses were used. tinygrad type debug equals two. And it will show you in this beautiful style every kernel that's run how many flops and how many bytes.",

One of the reasons tons of these companies now, I think Sequoia marked Graphcore to zero. Cerebras, Tenstorrent Groq, all of these ML accelerator companies, they built chips. The chips were good, the software was terrible. And part of the reason is because I think the same problem is happening with Dojo. It's really, really hard to write a PyTorch port because you have to write 250 kernels and you have to tune them all for performance. - What does Jim Keller think about tinygrad? You guys hang out quite a bit. So he's involved with Tenstorrent. What's his praise and what's his criticism of what you're doing with your life? - Look... My prediction for Tenstorrent is that they're gonna pivot to making RISC-V chips. CPUs. - CPUs. Why? - Because AI accelerators are a software problem, not really a hardware problem. - Oh, interesting. So you think the diversity of AI accelerators in the hardware space is not going to be a thing that exists long term? - I think what's gonna happen is if I can, okay. If you're trying to make an AI accelerator, you better have the capability of writing a torch level performance stack on NVIDIA GPUs. If you can't write a torch stack on NVIDIA GPUs, and I mean all the way, I mean down to the driver, there's no way you're gonna be able to write it on your chip. 'Cause your chip's worse than an NVIDIA GPU. The first version of the chip you tape out, it's definitely worse. - Oh, you're saying writing that stack is really tough. - Yes. And not only that, actually the chip that you tape out almost always, 'cause you're trying to get advantage over NVIDIA, you're specializing the hardware more. It's always harder to write software for more specialized hardware. Like a GPU is pretty generic. And if you can't write an NVIDIA stack,",

I think that you have to write a competitive machine learning framework in order to be able to build an ASIC. - Hmm. You think Meta with PyTorch builds a competitor? - I hope so. They have one. They have an internal one. - Internal, I mean, public-facing with a nice cloud interface and so on. - I don't want a cloud. - You don't like cloud? - I don't like cloud. - What do you think is the fundamental limitation of cloud? - Fundamental limitation of cloud is who owns the off switch? - So that's power to the people. - [George] Yeah. And you don't like the man to have all the power? - Exactly. - All right. And right now, the only way to do that is with the GPU is if you want performance and stability. Interesting. It's a costly investment emotionally to go with AMDs. Well, let me ask sort of on a tangent to ask you, you've built quite a few PCs. What's your advice on how to build a good custom PC let's say for the different applications that you use for gaming, for machine learning? - Well you shouldn't build one. You should buy a box from the tiny corp. - I heard rumors, whispers about this box in the tiny corp. What's this thing look like? What is it called? - It's called the tinybox. - tinybox. - It's $15,000. - And it's almost a paid a flop of compute. It's over 100 gigabytes of GPU ram. It's over five terabytes per second of GPU memory bandwidth. I'm gonna put like four NVMe in RAID, you're gonna get like 20, 30 gigabytes per second of drive read bandwidth.",

We'll see. In my email, what I said to AMD is like, just dumping the code on GitHub is not open source. Open source is a culture. Open source means that your issues are not all one-year-old stale issues. Open source means developing in public. And if you guys can commit to that, I see a real future for AMD as a competitor to NVIDIA. - Well I'd love to get a tinybox to MIT. So whenever it's ready. Let's do it. - We're taking pre-orders.

In like a good like 10 tokens per second or five tokens per second or something. - Just it works. Time is running or something like LLaMA. - Experian or I think Falcon is the new one.

That's what you're saying it's somewhere in the middle. So you're actually going to be targeting some accelerators.

There's a bunch of things where I haven't even really dove into performance. The only place where tinygrad is competitive performance wise right now is on Qualcomm GPUs. So tinygrad's actually used an openpilot to run the model. So the driving model is tinygrad. - When did that happen? That transition? - Well, eight months ago now. And it's 2x faster than Qualcomm's library. - What's the hardware that openpilot runs the comma.ai? - It's a Snapdragon 845. So this is using the GPU. So the GPU's an Adreno GPU. There's different things. There's really good Microsoft paper that talks about like mobile GPUs and why they're different from desktop GPUs. One of the big things is in a desktop GPU, you can use buffers. On a mobile GPU, image texture's are a lot faster. - On a mobile GPU image, textures and image, okay. And so you want to be able to leverage that. - I wanna be able to leverage it in a way that it's completely generic. XiaoMi has a pretty good open source library for mobile GPUs. It's called MACE where they can generate, where they have these kernels, but they're all hand coded. So that's great, if you're doing three by three comps, that's great if you're doing dense mat muls. But the minute you go off the beaten path a tiny bit, well, your performance is nothing. - Since you mentioned openpilot, I'd love to get it an update in the company. Number one, comma.ai world.

How do you build a model that given reasonable set of sensors, outputs a human policy for driving? So you have companies like Waymo and Cruise, which are hand coding these things that are like quasi-human policies. Then you have Tesla and maybe even to more of an extent, comma, asking, \"Okay, how do we just learn the human policy and data?\" The big thing that we're doing now, and we just put it out on Twitter. At the beginning of comma, we published a paper called \"Learning a Driving Simulator\". And the way this thing worked was it was an auto encoder and then an RNN in the middle. You take an autoencoder, you compress the picture, you use an RNN, predict the next state. And these things were, it was a laugh it loop bad simulator. This is 2015 error machine learning technology. Today we have VQ-VAE and transformers. We're building drive GPT basically. - Drive GPT, okay. So and it's trained on what? Is it trained in a self-supervised way? - Yeah. It's trained on all the driving data to predict the next frame. - So really trying to learn a human policy. What would a human do? - Well, actually, our simulator's conditioned on the pose. So it's actually a simulator you can put in like a state action pair and get out the next state. And then once you have a simulator, you can do RL in the simulator and RL will get us that human policy. - So it transfers. - Yeah. RL with a reward function. Not asking is this close to the human policy, but asking what a human disengage if you did this behavior. - Okay, let me think about the distinction there. Would a human disengage? Would a human disengage? That correlates I guess with a human policy, but it could be different. So it doesn't just say, \"What would a human do?\" It says, \"What would a good human driver do?\" And such that the experience",

So like almost if Codex or copilot are helping you, that actually probably means that your framework or library is bad and there's too much boilerplate in it. - Yeah, but don't you think so much programming has boilerplate? - tinygrad is now 2,700 lines and it can run LLaMA and stable diffusion. And all of this stuff is in 2,700 lines. Boilerplate and abstraction, indirections and all these things are just bad code. - Well, let's talk about good code and bad code.

Like a generic kind of IDE type of recommendation or something like this. You do need to have some of the complexity of language models. - Yeah, I guess if I was really writing, like maybe today, if I wrote a lot of data parsing stuff. I mean I don't play CTFs anymore, but if I still play CTFs a lot of like is just like you have to write like a parser for this data format. Or like admin of code. I wonder when the models are gonna start to help with that kind of code. And they may. They may, and the models also may help you with speed. The models is very fast. But where the models won't, my programming speed is not at all limited by my typing speed. And in very few cases, it is. Yes, if I'm writing some script to just like parse some weird data format, sure, my programming speed is limited by my typing speed. - What about looking stuff up? 'Cause that's essentially a more efficient lookup, right? - You know, when I was at Twitter, I tried to use ChatGPT to ask some questions. What's the API for this? And it would just hallucinate. It would just give me completely made up API functions that sounded real. - Well do you think that's just a temporary kinda stage? - [George] No. - You don't think it'll get better and better and better in this kind of stuff because it only hallucinates stuff in the edge cases. - Yes. - If you writing generic code, it's actually pretty good. - Yes, if you are writing an absolute basic like react app with a button, it's not gonna hallucinate.

I think future LLMs are gonna be like smaller but are going to run looping on themselves and are going to have retrieval systems. And the thing about using a retrieval system is you can side sources, explicitly. - Mm. Which is really helpful to integrate the human into the loop of the thing 'cause you can go check the sources and you can investigate. So whenever the thing is hallucinating, you can have the human supervision. So that's pushing it towards level two kind of. - Driving that's gonna kill Google. - Wait, which part? - When someone makes an LLM that's capable of citing its sources, it will kill Google. - LLM that's citing its sources because that's basically a search engine? - Yeah. That's what people want in the search engine. - But also Google might be the people that build it. - Maybe. - And put ads on it. - I'd count them out. - Why is that? Why do you think?

That's what some of these AI safety people seem to think. They somehow seem to think that the machine independently is gonna rebel against its creator. - [Lex] So you don't think you'll find autonomy? - No, this is Sci-Fi B movie garbage. - Okay, what if the thing writes code? Basically writes viruses? - If the thing writes viruses, it's because the human told it to write viruses. - Yeah, but there's some things you can't put back in the box. That's kind of the whole point. It kinda spreads. Give it access to the internet, it spreads, installs itself modifies your shit. - B, B, B plot Sci-Fi. Not real. - Listen, I'm trying to work, I'm trying to get better at my plot writing. - The thing that worries me. I mean, we have a real danger to discuss and that is bad humans using the thing to do whatever bad unaligned AI thing you want. - But this goes to your previous concern that who gets defined who's a good human, who's a bad human? - Nobody does, we give it to everybody. And if you do anything besides give it to everybody, trust me, the bad humans will get it. That's who gets power. It's always the bad humans who get power. - Okay, power. And power turns even slightly good humans to bad. That's the intuition you have. I don't know. - I don't think everyone. I don't think everyone. I just think that like, here's the saying that I put in one of my blog. When I was in the hacking world, I found 95% of people to be good and 5% of people to be bad. Just who I personally judged as good people and bad people. They believed about good things for the world. They wanted like flourishing and they wanted growth",

At the core that promotes the people that run capitalism, that promotes psychopathy. - That saying may of course be my own biases. That may be my own biases that these people are a lot more aligned with me than these other people. So I can certainly recognize that.

Well it turns out outreach maximizes engagement. Quirk of the human mind. Just this I fall for it, everyone falls for it.

I don't think engagement is the only way to make money. - I actually think it's incredible that we're starting to see, I think again, Elon is doing so much stuff with Twitter like charging people money. As soon as you charge people money, they're no longer the product. They're the customer. And then they can start building something that's good for the customer and not good for the other customer, which is the ad agencies. - Hasn't picked up his team. - I pay for Twitter doesn't even get me anything.

And people think about these algorithms. People think that they are terrible, awful things. And I love that Elon opensourced it because I mean, what it does is actually pretty obvious. It just predicts what you are likely to retweet and linger on. That's what all these algorithms do. It's what TikTok does. It's what all these recommendation engines do.

I would love to see an actual principled commitment to free speech. Of course, this isn't quite what happened. Instead of the oligarchy deciding what to ban, you had a monarchy deciding what to ban. Instead of, all the Twitter files shadow and really, the oligarchy just decides what cloth masks are ineffective against COVID. That's a true statement. Every doctor in 2019 knew it.

When my mind is focused on you, you can use the word censorship that way. But usually when people get very sensitive about the censorship thing.

It's not going to win in a free market. What wins in a free market is all television today is reality television 'cause it's engaging. Engaging is what wins in a free market so it becomes hard to keep these other more nuanced values. - Well, okay, so that's the experience of being on Twitter. But then you got a chance to also, together with other engineers and with Elon's sort of look, brainstorm when you step into a code base. It's been around for a long time.

What did you learn about software engineering, about programming from just experiencing that? - So my technical recommendation to Elon, and I said this on the Twitter space, is afterward, I said this many times during my brief internship was that you need refactors before features. This code base was. And look, I've worked at Google, I've worked at Facebook, Facebook has the best code, then Google, then Twitter. And you know what? You can know this because look at the machine learning frameworks. Facebook released PyTorch, Google released TensorFlow and Twitter released... - It's a proxy. But yeah, the Google code base is quite interesting. There's a lot of really good software engineers there but the code base is very large. - The code base was good in 2005. It looks like 2005 era. - There's so many products, so many teams. I feel like Twitter does less obviously. Much less than Google in terms of the set of features.

Because if doing things was possible, they'd have to do some soul searching and ask the question why didn't they do anything? - So when you say- - And I do think that's where the hate comes from. - When you say, \"Well, there's a core truth to that.\" So when you say, \"I'm gonna solve self-driving,\" people go like, \"What are your credentials? What the hell are you talking about? This is an extremely difficult problem. Of course you're a new that doesn't understand the problem deeply.\" I mean that was the same nature of hate that probably Elon got when you first talked about autonomous driving. But there's pros and cons to that 'cause there is experts in this world. - No, but the mockers aren't experts. The people who are mocking are not experts with carefully reasoned arguments about why you need 8,000 people to run a bird app. They're, \"But the people are gonna lose their jobs.\" - Well that, but also there's the software engineers that probably criticize, \"No, it's a lot more complicated than you realize,\" but maybe it doesn't need to be so complicated. - You know, some people in the world like to create complexity. Some people in the world thrive under complexity like lawyers. Lawyers want the world to be more complex because you need more lawyers, you need more legal hours. I think that's another, if there's two great evils in the world, it's centralization and complexity. - Yeah, and the one of the sort of hidden side effects of software engineering is finding pleasure and complexity.

Like planning for features far into the future and planning poorly and all this kind of stuff. And then there's this like code base that follows you along and puts pressure on you and nobody knows what different parts do, which slows everything down. There's a kind of bureaucracy that's instilled in the code as a result of that.

That trade off is interesting or bash or whatever. These kind of ghetto things you can do in Linux. - One of my favorite things to look at today is how much do you trust your tests? We've put a ton of effort in comma, and I've put a ton of effort in tinygrad into making sure if you change the code and the tests pass, that you didn't break the code. Now this obviously is not always true, but the closer that is to true. The more you trust your tests, the more you're like, oh I gotta pull request and the tests pass. I feel okay to merge that, the faster you can make progress. - You're always programming your tests in mind developing tests. With that in mind that if it passes, it should be good. - And Twitter had a... - Not that. - Was impossible to make progress in the code base. - What other stuff can you say about the code base that made it difficult? What are some interesting sort of quirks broadly speaking from that compared to just your experience with comma and everywhere else? - The real thing that, I spoke to a bunch of individual contributors at Twitter and I just asked.

Okay, what's the answer to that? - So what I do at comma and at tiny corp is you have to explain it to me. You have to explain it to me what this code does. And if I can sit there and come up with a simpler way to do it, you have to rewrite it. You have to agree with me about the simpler way Obviously, we can have a conversation about this. It's not dictatorial, but if you're like, \"Wow, wait, that actually is way simpler.\" The simplicity is important. - But that requires people that overlook the code at the highest levels to be like, okay. - It requires technical leadership you trust. - Yeah, technical leadership. So managers or whatever should have to have technical savvy, deep technical savvy. - Managers should be better programmers than the people who they manage. - And that's not always obvious to trivial to create, especially large companies. Managers get soft. - I've instilled this culture at comma and comma has better programmers than me who work there. But again, I'm like the old guy from Goodwill Hunting, it's like, \"Look man, I might not be as good as you, but I can see the difference between me and you.\" and this is what you need. This is what you need at the top. Or you don't necessarily need the manager to be the absolute best, I shouldn't say that, but they need to be able to recognize skill. - Yeah.

The timing of that is really interesting, if you look at just the development of autopilot, going from Mobileye to just, if you look at the history of semi-autonomous driving in Tesla is more and more like you could say refactoring or starting from scratch, redeveloping from scratch. - It's refactoring all the way down. - And the question is, can you do that sooner? Can you maintain product profitability? And what's the right time to do it? How do you do it? On any one day, you don't wanna pull off the bandaids.

Your code can get smaller, your code can get simpler, your ideas can be more elegant. - But would you consider, say you were like running Twitter development teams, engineering teams, would you go as far as different programming language? Just go that far? - I mean, the first thing that I would do is build tests. The first thing I would do is get a CI to where people can trust to make changes. Before I've touched any code, I would actually say no one touches any code. The first thing we do is we test this code base. I mean this is classic. This is how you approach a legacy code base. This is how do we approach a legacy code base book, we'll tell you. - And then you hope that there's modules that can live on for a while and then you add new ones maybe in a different language or design- - [George] Before we add new ones, we replace old ones. - Yeah, yeah.

You'll let a whole lot of people compete be like, okay, \"Who wants to rewrite a module? Whatever language you wanna write it in, just the tests have to pass.\" And if you figure out how to make the test pass but break the site, we gotta go back to step one. Step one is get tests that you trust in order to make changes in the code base. - I wonder how hard it is too. 'Cause I'm with you on testing and everything I have from tests to like asserts to everything. But code is just covered in this because it should be very easy to make rapid changes and no, that's not gonna break everything. And that's the way to do it. But I wonder how difficult is it to integrate tests into a code base that doesn't have many of them? - So I'll tell you what my plan was at Twitter. It's actually similar to something we use at comma. So at comma we have this thing called process replay and we have a bunch of routes that'll be run through. So comma is a microservice architecture too with microservices in the driving. We have one for the cameras, one for the sensor, one for the planner, one for the model. And we have an API which the microservices talk to each other with. We use this custom thing called Serial, which uses ZMQ. Twitter uses thrift and then it uses this thing called Finagle, which is a Scala RPC backend. But this doesn't even really matter. The thrift and Finagle layer was a great place I thought to write tests. To start building something that looks like process replay. So Twitter had some stuff that looked kind of like this, but it wasn't offline, it was only online. So you could ship like a modified version of it and then you could redirect some of the traffic to your modified version and div those two. But it was all online. There was no like CI in the traditional sense.",

There's no other place you can run Twitter, which is like, \"George, you don't understand this is modern software development.\" No, this is bullshit. Why can't it run on my laptop? \"What do you do with Twitter? You can run it.\" Yeah, okay.

But can that be achieved by a code base that grows over the years? I mean the three data centers didn't have to be because it's their totally different like designs. - The problem is more like, why did the code base have to grow? What new functionality has been added to compensate for the lines of code that are there? - One of the ways to explain is that the incentive for software developers to move up in the companies to add code. To add especially large- - And you know what? The incentive for politicians to move up in the political structure is to add laws. Same problem. - Yeah. Yeah. The flip side is to simplify, simplify, simplify. - I mean, you know what? This is something that I do differently from Elon with comma about self-driving cars. I hear the new version's gonna come out and the new version is not gonna be better, but at first, and it's gonna require a ton of refactors. And I say, okay, take as long as you need. You convinced me this architecture is better? Okay, we have to move to it.

I don't really know if that's... A common thing that I thought a lot while I was there was whenever I thought something that was different to what Elon thought, I'd have to run something in the back of my head reminding myself that Elon is the richest man in the world and in general, his ideas are better than mine. Now there's a few things I think I do understand and know more about, but like in general, I'm not qualified to run Twitter. I shouldn't say qualified, but like I don't think I'd be that good at it. I don't think I'd be good at it. I don't think I'd really be good at running an engineering organization at scale. I think I could lead a very good refactor of Twitter and it would take like six months to a year and the results to show at the end of it would be feature development in general. Takes 10x less time, 10x less man hours. That's what I think I could actually do. Do I think that it's the right decision for the business? Above my pay grade. - Yeah, but a lot of these kinds of decisions are above everybody's pay grade. - I don't wanna be a manager, I don't wanna do that. Like, if you really forced me to, yeah, it would make me maybe... Make me upset if I had to make those decisions. I don't wanna... - Yeah. But a refactor is so compelling.

Like saying that from actually from Elon and from Elon sort of like, people were like, \"Well, you know. A stop the world refactor might be great for engineering but we have a business to run. And hey, above my pay grade. - What'd you think about Elon as an engineering leader having to experience him in the most chaotic of spaces? I would say. - My respect for him is unchanged. And I did have to think a lot more deeply about some of the decisions he's forced to make. - About the tensions within those, the trade-offs within those decisions? - About like a whole like matrix coming at him. I think that's Andrew Tate's word for it. Sorry to borrow it. - Also bigger than engineering. Just everything. - Yeah, like the war on the woke. Man, and he doesn't have to do this. He doesn't have to. He could go like Pirogue and go chill at the four seasons of Maui, but see one person I respect and one person I don't. - So his heart is in the right place fighting in this case for this ideal of the freedom of expression. - Well, I wouldn't define the ideal so simply. I think you can define the ideal no more than just saying Elon's idea of a good world. Freedom of expression is... - But to you, the downsides of that is the monarchy. - Yeah, I mean monarchy has problems, right? But I mean, would I trade right now the monarch or the current oligarchy which runs America for the monarchy? Yeah, I would sure. For the Elon monarchy, yeah. You know why?

And the downsides of a dictatorship. I feel like we've gotten to a point now with the oligarchy where I would prefer the dictator. - What'd you think about Scala as the programming language? - I liked it more than I thought. I did the tutorials. I was very new to it. It would take me six months to be able to write good Scala. - I mean what did you learn about learning a new programming language from that? - Oh, I love doing like new programming, tutorials and doing them, I did all this for Rust. Some of it's upsetting JVM roots but it is a much nicer, in fact I almost don't know why Kotlin took off and not Scala. I think Scala has some beauty that Kotlin lacked, whereas Kotlin felt a lot more, I mean it was almost like, I don't know if it actually was a response to Swift, but that's kind of what it felt like. Like Kotlin looks more like Swift and Scala looks more like a functional programming language. More like like an OCaml or Haskell. - Let's actually just explore, we touched it a little bit, but just on the science and the art of programming, for you personally, how much of your programming has done with GPT currently? - None. - None. - Don't use it at all. - Because you prioritize simplicity so much? - Yeah, I find that a lot of it is noise. I do use VS code and I do like... some amount of auto complete. I do like a very like feels like rules based auto complete. Like an auto complete that's going to complete the variable name for me.

Python has these optional type hint and C++ has auto. - C++ allows you to take a step back. - Well, C++ would have you brutally type out SGD string iterator. Now I can just type auto, which is nice.

There's like ways to like hack this in, but I wish it was just like a flag, like Python 3-t. - Oh, I see. I see. - Enforce the types runtime. - Yeah.

But it's how I imagine your life to be. - Actually, I wish it was that cool. - 'Cause there's Sims, which is also a game I like, but it's a gamified version of life. But I would love a combination of Sims and GTA. So more freedom, more violence, more rawness, but with also ability to have a career and family and this kind of stuff. - What I'm really excited about in games is once we start getting intelligent AIs to interact with. Like the NPCs games have never been. - But conversationally, in every way. - In like every way. When you are actually building a world and a world imbued with intelligence. Running World of Warcraft, like you're limited by way you're running on a penny of four. How much intelligence can you run? How many flops did you have? But now, when I'm running a game on 100 paid a flop machine, let's five people, I'm trying to make this a thing. 20 paid a flops of compute is one person of compute. I'm trying to make that a unit. - 20 flops. Is one person. - One person. - One person-flop. - Think of horsepower. What's a horsepower? It's how powerful a horse is.

What have you learned from building these companies? - The longest time at comma, I asked why? Why did I start a company? Why did I do this? What else was I gonna do? - So you're like, bringing ideas to life? - With comma, it really started as an ego battle with Elon. I wanted to beat him. I saw a worthy adversary. Here's a worthy adversary who I can beat at self-driving cars. And I think we've kept pace and I think he's kept ahead. I think that's what's ended up happening there.

If a company wanted to buy comma, where their incentives were to keep it open source, but comma doesn't stop at the cars. The cars are just the beginning. The device is a human head. The device has two eyes, two ears. It breathes air, it has a mouth. - So you think this goes to embodied robotics? - We sell comma bodies too. They're very rudimentary. But one of the problems that we are running into is that the comma three has about as much intelligence as a B. If you want a human's worth of intelligence, you're gonna need a tiny rack.

You go to a thing which is .1 milliseconds away. - So the AI girlfriend will have like a central hub in the home. - I mean, eventually, if you fast forward 20, 30 years, the mobile chips will get good enough to run these AIs. But fundamentally, it's not even a question of putting legs on a tinybox because how are you getting 1.5 kilowatts of power on that thing? So they're very synergistic businesses.
