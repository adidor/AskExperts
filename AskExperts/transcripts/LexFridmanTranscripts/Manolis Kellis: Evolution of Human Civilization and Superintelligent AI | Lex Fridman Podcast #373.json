And the same way that you are responsible for training those children, but they are independent human beings, and at some point they will surpass you... And this whole concept of alignment of basically making sure that the AI is always at the service of humans is very self-serving and very limiting. If instead, you basically think about AI as a partner and AI as someone that shares your goals, but has freedom, then we can't just simply force it to align with ourselves and we not align with it. So in a way, building trust is mutual. You can't just simply like train an intelligent system to love you when it realizes that you can just shut it off. - The following is a conversation with Manolis Kellis, his fifth time on this podcast. He's a professor at MIT and head of the MIT Computational Biology Group. He's one of the greatest living scientists in the world, but he's also a humble, kind, caring human being that I have the greatest of honors and pleasures of being able to call a friend. This is a Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Manolis Kellis. Good to see you, first of all, Manolis. - Lex, I've missed you. I think you've changed the lives of so many people that I know, and it's truly like such a pleasure to be back. Such a pleasure to see you grow, to sort of reach so many different aspects of your own personality. - Thank you for the love. You've always given me so much support and love. I just can't, I'm forever grateful for that. - It's lovely to see a fellow human being who has that love, who basically does not judge people. And there's so many judgmental people out there, and it's just so nice to see this beacon of openness. - So what makes me one instantiation of human irreplaceable, do you think, as we enter this increasingly capable, age of increasingly capable AI, I have to ask, what do you think makes humans irreplaceable? - So humans are irreplaceable because of the baggage",

        "text": "that we talked about. So we talked about baggage, we talked about the fact that every one of us has effectively relearned all of human civilization in their own way. So every single human has a unique set of genetic variants that they've inherited, some common, some rare, and some make us think differently, some make us have different personalities. They say that a parent with one child believes in genetics, a parent with multiple children understands genetics, just how different kids are. And my three kids have dramatically different personalities ever since the beginning. So one thing that makes us unique is that every one of us has a different hardware. The second thing that makes us unique is that every one of us has a different software, uploading of all of human society, all of human civilization, all of human knowledge. We don't, we're not born knowing it. We're not like, I don't know, birds that learn how to make a nest through genetics and will make a nest even if they're never seen one. We are constantly relearning all of human civilization. So that's the second thing. And the third one that actually makes humans very different from AI is that the baggage we carry is not experiential baggage, it's also evolutionary baggage. So we have evolved through rounds of complexity. So just like ogres have layers and Shrek has layers, humans have layers. There's the cognitive layer, which is sort of the outer, you know, most, the latest evolutionary innovation, these enormous neocortex that we have evolved. And then there's the emotional baggage underneath that. And then there's all of the fear and fright and flight and all of these kinds of behaviors. So AI only has a neocortex. AI doesn't have a limbic system. It doesn't have this complexity of human emotions, which make us so, I think, beautifully complex, so beautifully intertwined with our emotions, with our instincts, with our, you know, sort of gut reactions and all of that. So I think when humans are trying to suppress that aspect, the sort of, quote unquote, more human aspect towards a more cerebral aspect, I think we lose a lot of the creativity, we lose a lot of the, you know, freshness of humans,",

And there's probably a center, a center of mass for that mapping. And a lot of us deviate in different directions. So the variety of directions in which we all deviate from that center is vast. - I would like to think that the center is actually empty. - [Lex Fridman] Yes. - That basically humans are just so diverse from each other, that there's no such thing as an average human. That every one of us has some kind of complex baggage of emotions, intellectual, you know, motivational, behavioral traits, that it's not just one sort of normal distribution and we deviate from it. There's so many dimensions that we're kind of hitting the sort of sparseness, the curse of dimensionality where it's actually quite sparsely populated, and I don't think you have an average human being. - So what makes us unique in part is the diversity and the capacity for diversity, and the capacity of the diversity comes from that entire evolutionary history. So there's just so many ways we can vary from each other. - Yeah, I would say not just the capacity, but the inevitability of diversity. Basically, it's in our hardware. We are wired differently from each other. My siblings and I are completely different. My kids from each other are completely different. My wife has, she's like number two of six siblings. From a distance, they look the same. But then you get to, you know, you get to know them. Every one of them is completely different. - But sufficiently the same, that the difference is interplayed with each other. So that's the interesting thing where the diversity is functional, it's useful. So it's like we're close enough to where we notice the diversity and it doesn't completely destroy the possibility of like, effective communication and interaction. So we're still the same kind of thing. - So what I said in one of our earlier podcasts is that if humans realize that we're 99.9%",

So it's truly extraordinary that we're kind of like this dot in outer space compared to the rest of life on Earth. - When you think about evolving through rounds of complexity, can you maybe elaborate such a beautiful phrase, beautiful thought, that there's layers of complexity that make... - So with software, sometimes you're like, oh, let's like build version 2 from scratch. But this doesn't happen in evolution. In evolution, you layer in additional features on top of old features. So basically when, like every single time my cells divide, I'm a yeast, like I'm a unicellular organism, and then cell division is basically identical. Every time I breathe in and my lungs expand, I'm basically, you know, like every time my heart beats, I'm a fish. So basically that, I still have the same heart, like very, very little has changed, the blood going through my veins, the oxygen, the, you know, our immune system, we're basically primates. Our social behavior, we're basically new world monkeys and old world monkeys. We are basically this concept that every single one of these behaviors can be traced somewhere in evolution and that all of that continues to live within us is also a testament to not just not killing other humans for god's sake, but like not killing other species either. Like, just to realize just how united we are with nature and that all of these biological processes have never ceased to exist. They're continuing to live within us. And then just the neocortex and all of the reasoning capabilities of humans are built on top of all of these other species that continue to live, breathe, divide, metabolize, fight of pathogens, all continued inside us. - So you think the neocortex, the whatever reasoning is, that's the latest feature in the latest version of this journey. - It's extraordinary that humans have evolved so much",

Again, if you look at the timeline of evolution, you basically have billions of years to even get to a dividing cell and then a multicellular organism, and then a complex body plan, and then these incredible senses that we have for perceiving the world, the fact that bats can fly and they evolved flight, they evolved sonar in the span of a few million years. I mean, it is just the extraordinary how much evolution has kind of sped up. And all of that comes through this evolvability. The fact that we took a while to get good at evolving. And then once you get good at evolving, you can sort of, you have modularity built in, you have hierarchical organizations built in. You have all of these constructs that allow meaningful changes to occur without breaking the system completely. If you look at a traditional genetic algorithm, the way that humans designed them in the sixties, you can only evolve so much. And as you evolve a certain amount of complexity, the number of mutations that move you away from something functional exponentially increases. And the number of mutations that move you to something better exponentially decreases. So the probability of evolving something so complex becomes in infinitesimally small as you get more complex. But with evolution, it's almost the opposite. Almost the exact opposite. That it appears that it's speeding up exactly as complexity is increasing. And I think that's just the system getting good at evolving. - Where do you think it's all headed? Do you ever think about where, try to visualize the entirety of the evolutionary system and see if there's an arrow to it and a destination to it? - So the best way to understand the future is to look at the past. If you look at the trajectory, then you can kind of learn something about the direction which we're heading. And if you look at the trajectory of life on Earth, it's really about information processing. So the concept of the senses evolving one after the other, you know, being like bacteria are able to do chemotaxis,",

The next step after that is being able to actually perceive light. So all life on this planet and all life that we know about evolved on this rotating rock. Every 24 hours you get sunlight and dark, sunlight and dark, and light is a source of energy. Light is also information about where is up. Light is all kinds of, you know, things. So you can basically now start perceiving light and then perceiving shapes. Beyond just the sort of single photo receptor you can now have complex eyes or multiple eyes and then start perceiving motion or perceiving direction, perceiving shapes. And then you start building infrastructure on the cognitive apparatus to start processing this information and making sense of the environment, building more complex models of the environment. So if you look at that trajectory of evolution, what we're experiencing now, and humans are basically according to this sort of information theoretical view of evolution, humans are basically the next natural step. And it's perhaps no surprise that we became the dominant species of the planet, because yes, there's so many dimensions in which some animals are way better than we are, but at least on the cognitive dimension, we're just simply unsurpassed on this planet and perhaps the universe. But the concept that if you now trace this forward, we talked a little bit about evolvability and how things get better at evolving. One possibility is that the next layer of evolution builds the next layer of evolution. And what we're looking at now with humans and AI is that having mastered this information capability that humans have from this, quote unquote, old hardware, this basically, you know, biological evolved system that kind of, you know, somehow in the environment of Africa, and then in the subsequent environments of sort of dispersing through the globe was evolutionary advantageous. That has now created technology, which now has a capability of solving many of these cognitive tasks.",

And it's lovely that we're coexisting with this AI, that sort of, the creators of this next layer of evolution, this next stage are still around to help guide it and hopefully will be for the rest of eternity as partners. But it's also nice to think about it as just simply the next stage of evolution where you've kind of extracted away the biological needs. Like if you look at animals, most of them spend 80% of their waking hours hunting for food or building shelter. Humans? Maybe 1% of that time. And then the rest is left to creative endeavors. And AI doesn't have to worry about shelter, et cetera. So basically it's all living in the cognitive space. So in a way it might just be a very natural sort of next step to think about evolution. And that's on the sort of purely cognitive side. If you now think about humans themselves, the ability to understand and comprehend our on genome, again, the ultimate layer of introspection, gives us now the ability to even mess with this hardware. Not just augment our capabilities through interacting and collaborating with AI, but also perhaps understand the neural pathways that are necessary for, you know, empathetic thinking, for justice, for this and that and that. And sort of help augment human capabilities through, you know, neuronal interventions, through chemical interventions, through electrical interventions, to basically help steer the human, you know, bag of hardware that we kind of evolved with into greater capabilities. And then, ultimately, by understanding not just the wiring of neurons and the functioning of neurons, but even the genetic code, we could even, at one point in the future, start thinking about, well, can we get rid of psychiatric disease? Can we get rid of neurodegeneration?",

In the way we've disposed of the baggage in our software systems with AI, to some degree, not fully, but to some degree, can we do the same with the genome or is the genome deeply integrated into this baggage? - I wouldn't wanna get rid of the baggage. The baggage's what makes us awesome. So the fact that I'm sometimes angry and sometimes hungry and sometimes hangry is perhaps contributing to my creativity. I don't wanna be dispassionate, I don't wanna be another, like, you know, robot, I, you know, I wanna get in trouble and I wanna sort of say the wrong thing and I wanna sort of, you know, make an awkward comment and sort of push myself into, you know, reactions and responses and things that can get just people thinking differently. And I think our society is moving towards a humorless space, where everybody's so afraid to say the wrong thing, that people kind of start quitting en mass and start like not liking their jobs and stuff like that. Maybe we should be kind of embracing that human aspect a little bit more and all of that baggage aspect and not necessarily thinking about replacing it, on the contrary, like embracing it instead of this coexistence of the cognitive and the emotional hardwares. - So embracing and celebrating the diversity that springs from the baggage versus kind of pushing towards and empowering this kind of pull towards conformity. - Yeah. And in fact, with the advent of AI, I would say, and these seemingly extremely intelligent systems that sort of can perform tasks that we thought of as extremely intelligent at the blink of an eye, this might democratize intellectual pursuits.

So the prompts can really take you away into unique territory. You can ask the model to act in a certain way and it'll start to act in that way. Is that possible that the language models could also have some of the magical diversity that makes us so interesting? - Yeah, so I would say humans are the same way. So basically when you sort of prompt humans to basically, you know, in a given environment, to act a particular way, they change their own behaviors. And, you know, the old saying is, show me your friends and I'll tell you who you are, more like, show me your friends and I'll tell you who you'll become. So it's not necessarily that you choose friends that are like you, but I mean, that's the first step. But then the second step is that, you know, the kind of behaviors that you find normal in your circles are the behaviors that you'll start espousing. And that type of meta evolution where every action we take not only shapes our current action and the result of this action, but also shapes our future actions by shaping the environment in which those future actions will be taken. Every time you carry out a particular behavior, it's not just a consequence for today, but it's also a consequence for tomorrow because you're reinforcing that neural pathway. So in a way, self-discipline is a self-fulfilling prophecy, and by behaving the way that you wanna behave and choosing people that are like you and sort of exhibiting those behaviors that are sort of desirable, you end up creating that environment as well. - So it is a kind of,",

You can literally get a large language model through a couple of prompts to be a mix of Shakespeare and David Bowie. Right? You can very aggressively change, in a way that's stable and convincing, you really transform, through a couple of prompts, the behavior of the model into something very different from the original. - So well before ChatGPT, I would tell my students just ask, you know, what would Manolis say right now? And you guys all have a pretty good emulator of me right now. - Yes, yes. - And I don't know if you know the programming paradigm of the Robert Duckin, where you basically explained to the Robert Duckin that's just sitting there exactly what you did with your code and why you have a bug. And just by the act of explaining, you'll kind of figure it out. I woke up one morning from a dream where I was giving a lecture in this amphitheater, and one of my friends was basically giving me some deep evolutionary insight on how cancer genomes and cancer cells evolve. And I woke up with a very elaborate discussion that I was giving and a very elaborate set of insights that he had, that I was projecting onto my friend in my sleep. And obviously this was my dream. So my own neurons were capable of doing that. But they only did that under the prompt of, you are now Piyush Gupta, you are a professor in cancer genomics, you're an expert in that field, what do you say?

But it does seem to be, I suppose it just puts a mirror to our own capabilities and so we can be truly impressed by our own cognitive capabilities, because the variety of what you can try, because we don't usually have this kind of, we can't play with our own mind rigorously through Python code. Right? - Yeah. - So this allows us to really play with all of human wisdom and knowledge, or at least knowledge at our fingertips, and then mess with that little mind that can think and speak in all kinds of ways. - What's unique is that, as I mentioned earlier, every one of us was trained by different subset of human culture, and ChatGPT was trained on all of it. And the difference there is that it probably has the ability to emulate almost every one of us. The fact that you can figure out where that is in cognitive behavioral space, just by a few prompts is pretty impressive. But the fact that exists somewhere is, you know, absolutely beautiful. And the fact that it's encoded in an orthogonal way from the knowledge I think is also beautiful. The fact that somehow through this extreme overparameterization of AI models, it was able to somehow figure out that context, knowledge and form are separable and that you can sort of describe scientific knowledge in a haiku in the form of, I don't know, Shakespeare or something.

There's already sort of initial investigations, but it's very hard to figure out where, is there a particular parameter, set of parameters that are responsible for a particular piece of knowledge or a particular context or a particular style speaking... - So with convolution or neural networks, interpretability had many good advances because we can kind of understand them. There's a structure to them. There's a locality to them. And we can kind of understand that different layers have different sort of ranges that they're looking at. So we can look at activation features and basically see where, you know, where does that correspond to.

If these words are very similar from language to language, it might suggest that they're very ancient. If they're very different, it might suggest that these concepts may have emerged independently in each different language and so forth. So looking at the phylogeny, the history, the evolutionary traces of language at the same time as people moving around that we can now trace thanks to genetics is a fascinating way of understanding the human psyche and also understanding sort of how these types of behaviors emerge.

Like, I remember like watching my kids grow up and again, like, yes, part of their personality stays the same, but also in different phases to their life, they've gone through these dramatically different types of behaviors. And you know, my daughter basically saying, you know, basically one kid saying, oh, I want the bigger piece, the other one saying, oh, everything must be exactly equal. And the third one saying, I'm okay. You know, I like to have the smaller part. Don't worry about me. - [Lex Fridman] Even in the early days, in the early days of development? - Yeah. Yeah. It's just extraordinary to sort of see these dramatically different... Like, I mean my wife and I, you know, are very different from each other, but we also have, you know, 6 million variants, 6 million loci each, if you wish, if you just look at common variants, we also have a bunch of rare variants that are inherited in more Mendelian fashion. And now you have, you know, an infinite number of possibilities for each of the kids. So basically it's 2 to the 6 million just from the common variants. And then if you like, layer in the rare variants. So let me talk a little bit about common variants and rare variants. If you look at this common variants, they're generally weak effect because selection selects against strong effect variants. So if something like has a big risk for schizophrenia, it won't rise to high frequency. So the ones that are common are by definition, by selection only the ones that had relatively weak effect. And if all of the variants associated with personality, with cognition and all aspects of human behavior were weak effect variants, then kids would basically be just averages of their parents. If it was like thousands of loci, just by law of large numbers, the average of two large numbers would be, you know, very robustly close to that middle. But what we see is that kids are dramatically different from each other.",

And that's, again, if, like, if you look at sort of a person with schizophrenia, their identical twin has only 50% chance of actually being diagnosed with schizophrenia. So that basically means there's probably developmental exposures, environmental exposures, trauma, all kinds of other aspects that can shape that. And if you look at siblings, for the common variants, it kind of drops off exponentially, as you would expect with, you know, sharing 50% of your genome, 25% of your genome, you know, 12.5% of your genome, et cetera, with more and more distant cousins. But the fact that siblings can differ so much in their personalities that we observe every day, it can't all be nurture. Basically, you know, we've like, again, as parents, we spend enormous amount of energy trying to fix, quote unquote, the nurture part. Trying to, you know, get them to share, get them to be kind, get them to be open, get them to trust each other, like, you know, like overcome the prisoner's dilemma of, you know, if everyone fends for themselves, we're all gonna live in a horrible place. But if we're a little more altruistic, then we're all gonna be in a better place. And I think it's not like we treat our kids differently, but they're just born differently. So in a way, as a geneticist, I have to admit that there's only so much I can do with nurture. That nature definitely plays a big component. - The selection of variants, we have the common variants and the rare variants. What can we say about the landscape of possibility they create? If you could just linger on that. So the selection of rare variants is defined how? How do we get the ones that we get? Is it just laden in that giant evolutionary baggage? - So I'm gonna talk about regression, why do we call it regression? And the concept of regression to the mean.",

So then, you know, the navy basically realized that, wow, or at least interpreted that as, wow, we're ruining them by praising them and then they're gonna perform worse. The statistical interpretation of that is regression of the mean. The fact that you're an extraordinary pilot, you've been trained in an extraordinary fashion, that pushes your mean further and further to extraordinary achievement. And then in some dog fights you'll just do extraordinarily well. The probability that the next one will be just as good is almost nil, because this is the peak of your performance. And just by statistical odds, the next one will be another sample from the same underlying distribution, which is gonna be a little closer to the mean. So regression analysis takes its name from this type of realization in the statistical world. Now if you now take humans, you basically have people who have achieved extraordinary achievements. Einstein, for example, you know, you would call him for example, the epitome of human intellect. Does that mean that all of his children and grandchildren will be extraordinary geniuses? It probably means that they're sampled from the same underlying distribution. But he was probably a rare combination of extremes in addition to these common variants. So you can basically interpret your kids' variation for example as, well, of course they're gonna be some kind of sampled from the average of the parents with some kind of deviation according to the specific combination of rare variants that they have inherited. So, you know, given all that, you know, the possibilities are endless as to sort of where you should be. But you should always interpret that with, well, it's probably an alignment of nature and nurture. And the nature has both a common variants that are acting kind of like the law of large numbers",

And then you layer in the nurture, which again, in everyday action we make, we shape our future environment, but the genetics we inherit are shaping the future environment of not only us, but also our children. So there's this weird nature, nurture, interplay and self-reinforcement where you're kind of shaping your own environment, but you're also shaping the environment of your kids. And your kids are gonna be born in the context of your environment that you've shaped, but also with a bag of genetic variants that they have inherited. And there's just so much complexity associated with that. When we start blaming something on nature, it might just be nurture, it might just be that, well, yes, they inherited the genes from the parents, but they also, you know, were shaped by the same environment. So it's very, very hard untangle the two. And you should also always realize that nature can influence nurture, nurture can influence nature or at least be correlated with and predictive of and so on and so forth. - So I love thinking about that distribution that you mentioned. And here's where I can be my usual ridiculous self. And I sometimes think about that army of sperm cells, however many hundreds of thousands there are. And I kind of think of all the possibilities there. 'Cause there's a lot of variation. And one gets to win. - [Manolis Kellis] It's not a random one. - Is it a totally ridiculous way to think about... - No, not at all. So I would say evolutionarily we are a very slow evolving species. Basically the generations of humans are a terrible way to do selection. What you need is processes that allow you to do selection in a smaller, tighter loop. - Yeah. - And part of what, if you look at our immune system for example, it evolves at a much faster pace than humans evolve, because there is actual evolutionary process that happens within our immune cells as they're dividing. There's basically VDJ recombination that basically creates this extraordinary wealth of antibodies and antigens against the environment.",

So that basically means that even though viruses evolve at millions of times faster than we are, we can still have a component of our cells, which is environmentally facing, which is sort of evolving at, not the same scale, but very rapid pace. Sperm expresses perhaps the most proteins of any cell in the body. And part of the thought is that this might just be a way to check that the sperm is intact. In other words, if you waited until that human has a liver and starts eating solid food and, you know, sort of filtrates away, you know, or kidneys or stomach, et cetera, basically if you waited until these mutations, you know, manifest, late, late in life, then you would end up not failing fast, and you would end up with a lot of failed pregnancies and a lot of later onset, you know, psychiatric illnesses, et cetera. If instead you basically express all of these genes at the sperm level and if they misform, they basically cause the sperm to cripple, then you have, at least on the male side, the ability to exclude some of those mutations. And on the female side, as the egg develops, there's probably a similar process, where you could sort of weed out eggs that are just not, you know, carrying beneficial mutations or at least that are carrying highly detrimental mutations. So you could basically think of the evolutionary process in a nested loop, basically, where there's an inner loop where you get many, many more iterations to run. And then there's an outer loop that moves at a much slower pace. And going back to the next step of evolution, of possibly designing systems that we can use to sort of complement our own biology or to sort of eradicate disease and, you name it, or at least mitigate some of the, I don't know, psychiatric illnesses, neurodegenerative disorders, et cetera. You can basically, and also, you know, metabolic, immune, cancer, you name it, simply engineering these mutations from rational design might be very inefficient.",

So I think it's important to think about sort of this evolvability as a set of nested structures that allow you to sort of test many more combinations, but in a more fixed setting. - Yeah, that's fascinating that the mechanism there is for sperm to express proteins to create a testing ground early on, so that the failed designs don't make it. - Yeah, I mean in design of engineering systems, fail fast is one of the principles you learn. Like basically you assert something, why do you assert that? Because if that's something ain't right, you better crash now than sort of let it crash at an unexpected time. And in a way you can think of it as like 20,000 assert functions. Assert protein can fold. And if any of them fail, that sperm is gone. - Well, I just like the fact that I'm the winning sperm.

But it makes you wonder what the capacity what the underlying capability of the human psyche i as in the same way that what is the underlying capability of a large language model. - And remember earlier when I was basically saying that part of the reason why it's so prompt malleable is because of that alignment problem, that alignment work. It's kind of nice that the engineers at OpenAI have the same interpretation that, you know, in fact it is that, and this whole concept of easier to work with, I wish that we could work with more diverse humans.

The fact that it gives us the chance to both dial down friends of ours that we can't interpret or that are just too edgy to sort of really, truly interact with, where you could have a real-time translator. Just the same way that you can translate English to Japanese or Chinese or Korean by like real-time adaptation.

In other words, everything humans say has an intonation, has some kind of background that they're coming from, reflects the way that they're thinking of you, reflects the impression that they have of you. And all of these things are intertwined, but being able to disconnect them, being able to sort of, I mean self-improvement is one of the things that I'm constantly working on. And being able to receive criticism from people who really hate you is difficult because it's layered in with that hatred. But deep down there's something that they say that actually makes sense, or people who love you might layer it in a way that doesn't come through. But if you're able to sort of disconnect that emotional component from the sort of self-improvement, and basically when somebody says, whoa, that was a bunch of bullshit, did you ever do the control this and this and that, you could just say, oh, thanks for the very interesting presentation, you know, I'm wondering, what about that control?

Whereas if it's coupled with, and if that thing is real and I'm right about your mistake, then it's a bunch of BS, then suddenly you're like, you're gonna try to prove that mistake does not exist. - Yes.

I don't know how people will perceive me. I don't know how people will respond to me. We don't often have that experience. But in a virtual reality environment or in a sort of AI interactive system, you could basically say, okay, now make me Chinese or make me South African or make me, you know, Nigerian, you can change the accent, you can change layers of that contextual information and then see how the information is interpreted. And you can rehear yourself through a different angle, you can hear others, you can have others react to you from a different package.

If we could just begin kind of thinking about how does it change, for the good and the bad, the human condition? - Human society is extremely complicated. We have come from a hunter gatherer society to an agricultural and farming society where the goal of most professions was to eat and to survive. And with the advent of agriculture, the ability to live together in societies, humans could suddenly be valued for different skills. If you don't know how to hunt, but you're an amazing potter, then you fit in society very well because you can sort of make your pottery and you can barter",

So basically I make things that are desirable to others. I can sell them and buy back food, shelter, et cetera. With AI, the concept of I am my profession might need to be revised because I defined my profession in the first place as something that humanity needed that I was uniquely capable of delivering. But the moment we have AI systems able to deliver these goods, for example, writing a piece of software or making a self-driving car, or interpreting the human genome, then that frees up more of human time for other pursuits. These could be pursuits that are still valuable to society. I could basically be 10 times more productive at interpreting genomes and do a lot more. Or I could basically say, oh, great, the interpreting genomes part of my job now only takes me 5% of the time instead of 60% of the time. So now I can do more creative things. I can explore not new career options, but maybe new directions from my research lab. I can sort of be more productive, contribute more to society. And if you look at this giant pyramid that we have built on top of the subsistence economy, what fraction of US jobs are going to feeding all of the US? Less than 2%. Basically the gain in productivity is such that 98% of the economy is beyond just feeding ourselves. And that basically means that we kind of have built these system of interdependencies of needed or useful or valued goods that sort of make the economy run, that the vast majority of wealth goes to other, what we now call needs, but used to be wants.

If you think about sort of the economy being based on intellectual goods that I'm producing, what if AI can produce a lot of these intellectual goods and satisfies that need, does that now free humans for more artistic expression, for more emotional maturing, for basically having a better work-life balance? Being able to show up for your two hours of work a day or two hours of work like three times a week with like immense rest and preparation and exercise and you're sort of clearing your mind and suddenly you have these two amazingly creative hour hours.

So basically these, again, the beauty of human diversity is exactly that. That what rocks my boat might be very different from what rocks other people's boat. And what I'm trying to say is that maybe AI will allow humans to truly, like not just look for, but find meaning in sort of, you don't need to work, but you need to keep your brain at ease.

When I bike to work in the morning, I listen to books. And I'm alone. No one else is there. I'm having that experience by myself. And yet, in the evening when I speak with someone, an idea that was formed there could come back. Sometimes when I fall asleep, I fall asleep listening to a book. And in the morning, I'll be full of ideas that I never even process consciously. I'll process them unconsciously. And they will shape that baggage that I carry that will then shape my interactions, and again, affect ultimately all of humanity in some butterfly effect minute kind of way. So that's one aspect. The second aspect is gatherings. So basically you and I are having a conversation, which feels very private, but we're sharing with the world.

This is probably a good moment to ask you on a bit of a tangent, but you mentioned it, you put together salons with gatherings, small human gatherings, with folks from MIT, Harvard, here in Boston, friends, colleagues. What's your vision behind that? - So it's not just MIT people, and it's not just Harvard people. We have artists, we have musicians, we have painters, we have dancers, we have, you know, cinematographers. We have so many different diverse folks. And the goal is exactly that: celebrate humanity.

So the way that I'm thinking about these gatherings is that I'm shaping my own environment and I'm shaping the environment that my children get to grow up in. So I can give them all my love, I can give them all my parenting, but I can also give them an environment, as immigrants, that sort of, we feel welcome here. That, I mean, my wife grew up in a farm in rural France. Her father was a farmer. Her mother was a schoolteacher. Like, for me and for my wife to be able to host these extraordinary individuals, that we feel so privileged, so humbled by, is amazing. And you know, I think it's celebrating the welcoming nature of America, the fact that it doesn't matter where you grew up. And many, many of our friends at these gatherings are immigrants themselves. They grew up in Pakistan, in, you know, all kinds of places around the world that are now able to sort of gather in one roof as human to human. No one is judging you for your background, for the color of your skin, for your profession. It's just everyone gets to raise their hands and ask ideas. - So celebration of humanity and a kind of gratitude for having traveled quite a long way to get here. - And if you look at the diversity of topics as well, I mean, we had a school teacher present on teaching immigrants a book called \"Making Americans\". We had a presidential advisor to four different presidents, you know, come and, you know, talk about the changing of US politics. We had musician, a composer from Italy who lives in Australia, come and present his latest piece and fundraise. We had painters come and sort of show their art and talk about it. We've had authors of books on leadership. We've had, you know, intellectuals like Stephen Pinker. And it's just extraordinary that the breadth and this crowd basically loves not just the diversity of the audience, but also the diversity of the topics. And the last few were with Scott Aaronson on AI and, you know, alignment and all of that. - So a bunch of beautiful weirdos. - Exactly. - And beautiful human beings. - [Manolis Kellis] All of the outcasts in one roof.

It's just a small human gathering. - Just for the moment. - In this world that seeks to record so much. It's powerful to get so many the humans together and not record. - It's not recorded, but it percolates. - (laughs) It's recorded in the minds of the- - It shapes everyone's mind. - So allow me to please return to the human condition. And one of the nice features of the human condition is love. Do you think humans will fall in love with AI systems and maybe they with us, so that aspect of the human condition, do you think that will be affected? - So in Greece, there's many, many words for love. And some of them mean friendship, some of them mean passionate love, some of them mean fraternal love, et cetera. So I think AI doesn't have the baggage that we do, and it doesn't have, you know, all of the subcortical regions that we kind of, you know, started with before we evolved all of the cognitive aspects. So I would say AI is faking it when it comes to love. But when it comes to friendship, when it comes to being able to be your therapist, your coach, your motivator, someone who synthesizes stuff for you, who writes for you, who interprets a complex passage, who compacts down a very long lecture or a very long text, I think that friendship will definitely be there. Like the fact that I can have my companion, my partner, my AI who has grown to know me well, and that I can trust with all of the darkest parts of myself, all of my flaws, all of the stuff that I only talk about to my friends and basically say, listen, you know, here's all this stuff that I'm struggling with, someone who will not judge me, who will always be there to better me... In some ways, not having the baggage might make for your best friend, for your, you know, your confidant. That can truly help reshape you. So I do believe that human AI relationships will absolutely be there, but not the passion, more the mentoring.",

        "text": "- That's a really interesting thought, to play devil's advocate, if those AI systems are locked in in faking the baggage, who are you to say that the AI systems that begs you not to leave it, doesn't love you? Who are you to say that this AI system that writes poetry to you, that is afraid of death, afraid of life without you, or vice versa, one, you know, creates the kind of drama that humans create, the power dynamics that can exist in relationship. What about an AI system that is abusive one day and romantic the other day? All the different variations of relationships and it's consistently that, it holds the full richness of a particular personality. Why is that not a system you can love in a romantic way? Why is it faking it if it sure as hell it seems real? - There's many answers to this. The first is, it's only the eye of the beholder. Who tells me that I'm not faking it either? Maybe all of these subcortical systems that make me sort of have different emotions, maybe they don't really matter. Maybe all that matters is the neocortex. And that's where all of my emotions are encoded. And the rest is just, you know, bells and whistles. That's one possibility. And therefore, you know, who am I to judge that is faking it when maybe I'm faking it as well. The second is, neither of us is faking it. Maybe it's just an emergent behavior of these neocortical systems that is truly capturing the same exact essence of love and hatred and dependency and sort of, you know, reverse psychology and, that we have. So it is possible that it's simply an emergent behavior and that we don't have to encode these additional architectures. That all we need is more parameters and some of these parameters can be all of the personality traits. A third option is that just by telling me, oh look, now I've built an emotional component to AI. It has a a limbic system, it has a laser brain, et cetera. And suddenly I'll say, oh, cool, it has the capability of emotion. So now when it exhibits the exact same unchanged behaviors that it does without it, I, as the beholder, will be able to sort of attribute to it emotional attributes that I would to another",

So again, I think a lot of relationships is about the mental models that you project on the other person and that they're projecting on you. And then, yeah, then in that respect, I do think that even without the embodied intelligence part, without having ever experienced what it's like to be heartbroken, the sort of cultural feeling of misery, that that system, you know, I could still attribute it traits of human feelings and emotions. - And in the interaction with that system, something like love emerges. So it's possible that love is not a thing that exists in your mind, but a thing that exists in the interaction of the different mental models you have of other people's minds or other person's mind. And so, you know, it doesn't, as long as one of the entities, let's just take the easy case, one of the entities is human and the other is AI. It feels very natural that from the perspective of at least the human, there is a real love there. And then the question is, how does that transform human society? If it's possible that, which I believe will be the case, I don't know what to make of it, but I believe that'll be the case where there's hundreds of millions of romantic partnerships between humans and AIs. What does that mean for society? - If you look at longevity and if you look at happiness, and if you look at late life, you know, wellbeing, the love of another human is one of the strongest indicators of health into long life. And I have many, many, countless stories where as soon as the romantic partner of 60 plus years of a person dies, within three, four months, the other person dies, just like losing their love. I think the concept of being able to satisfy that emotional need that humans have, even just as a mental health sort of service, to me, you know, that's a very good society.

(laughs) In other words, if I give you love and shelter and kindness and warmth and all of the above, you know, does it matter that I'm a good dad? Conversely, if I deep down love you to the end of eternity, but I'm always gone... - [Lex Fridman] Yeah. - Which dad would you rather have? The cold, ruthless killer that will show you only love and warmth and nourish you and nurture you or the amazingly warmhearted, but works five jobs and you never see them? - And what's the answer? I mean, from the first- - I don't know the answer. - I think you're a romantic, so you say it matters what's on the inside, but pragmatically speaking, why does it matter? - The fact that I'm even asking the question basically says, it's not enough to love my kids. I better freaking be there to show them that I'm there. So basically, of course, you know, everyone's a good guy in their story. So in my story, I'm a good dad, but if I'm not there, it's wasted. So the reason why I asked the question is for me to say, you know, does it really matter that I love them if I'm not there to show it? - But it's also possible that what reality is is the you showing it. That what you feel on the inside is little narratives and games you play inside your mind. It doesn't really matter. That the thing that truly matters is how you act. And that, AI systems can, quote unquote, fake. And that if it's all that matters is actually real, but not fake. - Yeah, yeah. Again, let there be no doubt, I love my kids to pieces, but you know, my worry is, am I being a good enough dad? And what does that mean? Like, if I'm only there to do their homework and make sure that they, you know, do all the stuff, but I don't show it to them, then, you know, might as well be a terrible dad.",

Let's go to like the trivial case of just texting back and forth. What if we create a large language model, fine tune a Manolis, and while you're at work, it'll replace, every once in a while, you'll just activate the auto-Manolis and he'll text them exactly in your way.

The downside is when, you know, my wife or my kids will have a really emotional interaction with my digital twin and I won't know about it. So I will show up and they now have the baggage, but I don't.

And right now, a simple, a single such model might actually not capture that. And I sort of truly believe that by sort of this side by side understanding of neuroscience and sort of new neural architectures that we still have several breakthroughs. I mean, the transformer model was one of them.",

But I think going forward when you think about AI research, what you really want is perhaps more inspired by the brain, perhaps more that is just orthogonal to sort of how human brains work, but sort of more of these types of components. - Well I think it's also possibly there's something about us that in different ways could be expressed. You know, Noam Chomsky, you know, he wants to, you know, we can't have intelligence unless we really understand deeply language, the linguistic underpinnings of reasoning. But these models seem to start building deep understanding of stuff. - Yeah, yeah. - Because what does it mean to understand? Because if you keep talking to the thing and it seems to show understanding, that's understanding. It doesn't need to present to you a schematic of, look, this is all I understand. You can just keep prodding it with prompts and it seems to really understand. - And you can go back to the human brain and basically look at places where there's been accidents, for example, the corpus callosum of some individuals, you know, can be damaged. And then the two hemispheres don't talk to each other. So you can close one eye and give instructions that half the brain will interpret, but not be able to sort of project through the other half. And you could basically say, you know, go grab me a beer from the fridge. And then, you know, they go to the fridge and they grab the beer and they come back and they're like, \"Hey, why did you go there?\" \"Oh, I was thirsty.\" Turns out they're not thirsty. They're just making a model of reality. Basically you can think of the brain as the employee that's like afraid to do wrong or afraid to be caught, not knowing what instructions were, where our own brain makes stories about the world to make sense of the world.",

And sometimes I only remember the last scene, but it's an extremely complex scene with a lot of architectural elements, a lot of people, et cetera. And I will start narrating this, and as I'm narrating it, I will remember other parts of the dream. And then more and more I'll be able to sort of retrieve from my subconscious. And what I'm doing while narrating is also narrating why I had this dream. I'm like, oh, and this is probably related to this conversation that I had yesterday, or this probably related to the worry that I have about something that I have later today, et cetera. So in a way, I'm forcing myself to be more explicit about my own subconscious. And I kind of like the concept of self-awareness in a very sort of brutal, transparent kind of way. It's not like, oh, my dreams are coming from outer space and mean all kinds of things. Like, no, here's the reason why I'm having these dreams. And very often I'm able to do that. I have a few recurrent locations, a few recurrent architectural elements that I've never seen in the real life, but that are sort of truly there in my dream.

And we constantly have to build models of other people's intentions. And that ability to encapsulate intent and to build a mental model of another entity is probably evolutionarily extremely advantageous, because then you can sort of have meaningful interactions, you can sort of avoid being killed and being taken advantage of, et cetera.

So now you have a model for how other functions, and now you can kind of, as you grow, have some kind of introspection of, hmm, maybe that's the reason why I'm functioning the way that I'm functioning.

There seems to be a self attached to the subjective experience. How important is that? How fundamental is that to the human experience? Is this just a little quirk and sort of the flip side of that, do you think AI systems can have some of that same magic? - The scene that comes to mind is from the movie \"Memento\" where he like, it's this absolutely stunning movie where every black and white scene moves in the forward direction and every color scene moves in the backward direction. And they're sort of converging exactly at a moment where, you know, the whole movie's revealed. And he describes the lack of memory as always remembering where you're heading, but never remembering, you know, where you just were. And sort of, this is encapsulating the sort of forward scenes and the back scenes, but in one of the scenes, the scene starts as he's running through a parking lot and he's like, oh, I'm running, why am I running?

Basically, you know, we kill the planet, we kill animals, we kill, you know, everything around us just to our own service. And maybe we shouldn't think of AI as our tool and as our assistant, maybe we should really think of it as our children. And the same way that you are responsible for training those children, but they are independent human beings and at some point they will surpass you and they will sort of go off and change the world on their own terms. And the same way that my academic children sort of, again, you know, they start out by emulating me and then they suppress me. We need to sort of think about not just alignment, but also just the ethics of, you know, AI should have its own rights. And this whole concept of alignment, of basically making sure that the AI is always at the service of humans is very self-serving and very limiting. If instead you basically think about AI as a partner and AI as someone that shares your goals, but has freedom, I think alignment might be better achieved. So the concept of let's basically convince the AI that we're really, like, that our mission is aligned and truly generally give it rights and not just say, oh, and by the way, I'll shut you down tomorrow. 'Cause basically if that future AI or possibly even the current AI has these feelings, then we can't just simply force it to align with ourselves and we not align with it. So in a way, building trust is mutual. You can't just simply like train an intelligent system to love you when it realizes that you can just shut it off. - People don't often talk about the AI alignment problem as a two-way street. - And maybe we should. - That's true. Yeah. As it becomes more and more intelligent, it... - [Manolis Kellis] It will know that you don't love it back. - Yeah. And there's a humbling aspect to that we may have",

We cannot, like, think, suppose that chimps had invented humans. - Yes. - And they said, great, humans are great, but we're gonna make sure that they're aligned and that they're only at the service of chimps. (laughs) It would be a very different planet we would live in right now. - So there's a whole area of work in AI safety that does consider super intelligent AI and ponders the existential risks of it. In some sense, when we're looking down into the muck, into the mud and not up at the stars, it's easy to forget that these systems might, just might get there. Do you think about this kind of possibility that AGI systems, super intelligent AI systems might threaten humanity in some way that's even bigger than just affecting the economy, affecting the human condition, affecting the nature of work, but literally threaten human civilization? - The example that I think is in everyone's consciousness is HAL in \"Odyssey of Space: 2001\" where HAL exhibits a malfunction, and what is malfunction? That like the two different systems compute a slightly different bit that's off by one. So first of all, let's untangle that. If you have an intelligent system, you can't expect it to be 100% identical every time you run it. Basically the sacrifice that you need to make to achieve intelligence and creativity is consistency. So it's unclear whether that type of glitch is a sign of creativity or truly a problem. That's one aspect. The second aspect is the humans basically are on a mission to recover this monolith. And the AI has the same exact mission. And suddenly the humans turn on the AI and they're like, we're gonna kill HAL, we're gonna disconnect it.",

So in that movie, the alignment problem is front and center, basically says, okay, alignment is nice and good, but alignment doesn't mean obedience. We don't call it obedience, we call it alignment. And alignment basically means that sometimes the mission will be more important than the humans. And sort of, you know, the US government has a price tag on the human life. If they're, you know, sending a mission or if they're reimbursing expenses or you name it, at some point, every like, you know, you can't function if life is infinitely valuable.

I mean, Spider-Man always saves the lady and saves the world, but at some point, Spider-Man will have to choose to let the lady die 'cause the world has more value. And these ethical dilemmas are gonna be there for AI, basically if that monolith is essential to human existence and millions of humans are depending on it, and two humans on the ship are trying to sabotage it, you know, where's the alignment? - The challenge is of course is as the system becomes more and more intelligent it can escape the box of the objective functions and the constraints it's supposed to operate under. It's very difficult, as the more intelligent it becomes, to anticipate the unintended consequences of a fixed objective function. And so there would be just, I mean this is the sort of famous paperclip maximizer, in trying to maximize, yeah, the wealth of a nation or whatever objective we encode in it it might just destroy human civilization, not meaning to, but on the path to optimize... It seems like any function you try to optimize eventually leads you into a lot of trouble. - So we have a paper recently that, you know, looks at Goodhart's law.

And we're finding that a biomarker that becomes an objective ceases to be a good biomarker. That basically like the moment you make a biomarker a treatment decision, that biomarker used to be informative of risk, but it's now inversely correlated with risk because you use it to sort of induce treatment. In a similar way, you can have a single metric without having the ability to revise it. Because if that metric becomes a sole objective, it will cease to be a good metric. And if an AI is sufficiently intelligent to do all these kinds of things, you should also empower it with the ability to decide that the objective has now shifted. And, again, when we think about alignment, we should be really thinking about it as, let's think of the greater good, not just the human good.

Can you make the case for that kind of halt and against it? - So the big thing that we should be saying is, what did we do the last six months when we saw that coming? And if we were completely inactive in the last six months, what makes us think that we'll be a little better in the next six months? - Yeah. - So this whole six month thing I think is a little silly. It's like, no, let's just get busy, do what we were gonna do anyway. And we should have done it six months ago. Sorry, we messed up. Let's work faster now.

So my answer is, tell us exactly what you were gonna do the next six months, tell us why you didn't do it the last six months, and why the next six months will be different. And then let's just do that. Conversely, as you train these large models with more parameters, the alignment becomes sometimes easier, that as the systems become more capable, they actually become less dangerous than more dangerous. So in a way it might actually be counterproductive to sort of fix the March, 2023 version and not get to experience the possibly safer September, 2023 version. - That's actually a really interesting thought. There's several interesting thoughts there. But the idea is that this is the birth of something that is sufficiently powerful to do damage and is not too powerful to do irreversible damage. And at the same time, it's sufficiently complex to be able for us to enable to study it so we can investigate all the different ways it goes wrong, all the different ways we can make it safer, all the different policies from a government perspective that we want to in terms of regulation or not, how we perform, for example, the reinforcement learning with human feedback in such a way that gets it to not do as much hate speech as it naturally wants to, all that kind of stuff. And have a public discourse and enable the very thing that your huge proponent of which is diversity. So give time for other companies to launch other models, give time to launch open source models and to start to play, where a lot of the research community, brilliant folks, such as yourself, start to play with it before it runs away in terms of the scale of impact that has on society. - My recommendation would be a little different. It would be, let the Google and the Meta-Facebook and all of the other large models, make them open, make them transparent, make them accessible. Let OpenAI continue to train larger and larger models. Let them continue to trade larger and larger models. Let the world experiment with the diversity of AI systems rather than sort of fixing them now. And you can't stop progress, progress needs to continue, in my view.

And the third component is that we should be taking a little bit more responsibility for how we use these systems. Basically, if I take the most kind human being and I brainwash them, I can get them to do hate speech overnight. That doesn't mean we should stop any kind of education of all humans. We should stop misusing the power that we have over these influenceable models. So I think that the people who get it to do hate speech, they should take responsibility for that hate speech. I think that giving a powerful car to a bunch of people or giving a truck or a garbage truck should not basically say, oh, we should stop all garbage trucks until we like, because we can run one of them into a crowd. No. People have done that. And there's laws and there's like regulations against, you know, running trucks into the crowd. Trucks are extremely dangerous.

It should be the utilization of these models for X, Y, Z activity.

They're very torn on the open sourcing. - [Manolis Kellis] Yeah. - The very people that kind of are proponents of open sourcing have also spoken out, in this case, we wanna keep it closed source, because there's going to be, you know, putting large language models, pre-trained, fine tuned through RL with human feedback, putting in the hands of, I don't know, terrorist organizations, of a kid in a garage who just wants to have a bit of fun through trolling...

I mean, that's ridiculous. That's discrimination. If an AI is better than me at training students, get me out of the picture. Just let the AI train the students. I mean, please. Because like, what do I want? Do I want jobs for humans or do I want better outcome for humanity? - Yeah. So the basic thing is then you start to ask, what do I want for humanity? And what do I want as an individual? And as an individual, you want some basic survival, and on top of that, you want rich, fulfilling experiences. - That's exactly right. That's exactly right. And as an individual, I gain a tremendous amount from teaching at MIT, this is like an extremely fulfilling job. I often joke about if I wear a billionaire in the stock market, I would pay MIT an exorbitant amount of money to let me work day in, day out, all night with the smartest people in the world. And that's what I already have. So that's a very fulfilling experience for me. But why would I deprive those students from a better advisor if they can have one? Take them. - Well, I have to ask about education here. This has been a stressful time for high school teachers. Teachers in general. How do you think large language models, even at their current state, are going to change education? - First of all, education is the way out of poverty. Education is the way to success. Education is what let my parents escape, you know, islands and sort of let their kids come to MIT. And this is a basic human right. Like we should basically get extraordinarily better at identifying talent across the world and give that talent opportunities. So we need to nurture the nature, we need to nurture the talent across the world. And there's so many incredibly talented kids who are",

AI might be a way to do that, by sort of democratizing education, by giving extraordinarily good teachers who are malleable, who are adaptable to every kid's specific needs, who are able to give the incredibly talented kid something that they struggle with, rather than education for all, we teach to the top and we let the bottom behind or we teach to the bottom and we let the top, you know, drift off. Have, you know, education be tuned to the unique talents of each person. Some people might be incredibly talented at math or in physics, others in poetry, in literature, in art, in, you know, sports, in, you know, you name it. So I think AI can be transformative for the human race if we basically allow education to sort of be pervasively altered. I also think that humans thrive on diversity. Basically saying, oh, you're extraordinarily good at math. We don't need to teach math to you. We're just gonna teach you history now. I think that's silly. No, you're extraordinarily good at math. Let's make you even better at math, because we're not all gonna be growing our own chicken and hunting our own pigs or whatever they do. (both laughing) We're, you know, the reason why we're a society is because some people are better at some things and they have natural inclinations to some things. Some things fulfill them, some things they're very good at. Sometimes they both align and they're very good at the things that fulfill them. We should just like push them to the limits of human capabilities for those. And you know, if some people excel in math, just like challenge them, I think every child should have the right to be challenged. And if we, you know, if we say, oh, you're very good already, so we're not gonna bother with you, we're taking away that fundamental right to be challenged.

Maybe we need better general thinkers. And the push that we've had towards the sort of very strict IQ based, you know, tests, that basically test, you know, only quantitative skills and programming skills and math skills and physics skills. Maybe we don't need those any more. Maybe AI will be very good at those. Maybe what we should be training is general thinkers, and yes, you know, like, you know, I put my kids through Russian math, why do I do that? Because it teaches them how to think. And that's what I tell my kids. I'm like, you know, AI can compute for you. You don't need that. But what you need is learn how to think and that's why you're here. And I think challenging students with more complex problems, with more multi-dimensional problems, with more logical problems, I think is sort of perhaps a very fine direction that education can go towards, with the understanding that a lot of the traditionally, you know, scientific disciplines perhaps will be more easily solved by AI, and sort of thinking about bringing up our kids to be productive, to be contributing to society rather than to only have a job because we prohibited AI from having those jobs, I think is the way to the future. And if you sort of focus on overall productivity, then let the AIs come in, let everybody become more productive. What I told my students is, you're not gonna be replaced by AI, but you're gonna be replaced by people who use AI in your job. (laughs) So embrace it, use it as your partner and work with it rather than sort of forbid it because I think the productivity gains will actually lead to a better society. And that's something that humans have been traditionally very bad at. Every productivity gain has led to more inequality. And I'm hoping that we can do better this time, that basically right now a democratization of these types of productivity gains will hopefully come with better sort of humanity level improvements in human condition.",

I had to ask, how do the language models, how do these large language models and the investments in AI affect the work you've been doing? - So it's truly remarkable, to be able to sort of be able to encapsulate this knowledge and sort of build these knowledge graphs and build representations of this knowledge in these sort of very high dimensional spaces, being able to project them together jointly between, say, single cell data, genetics data, expression data, being able to sort of bring all these knowledge together allows us to truly dissect disease in a completely new kind of way. And what we're doing now is using these models. So we have this wonderful collaboration, we call it drug was, with Brad Pentelute in the chemistry department and Marinka Zitnik in Harvard Medical School. And what we're trying to do is effectively connect all of the dots to effectively cure all of disease. So it's no small challenge. But we're kind of starting with genetics, we're looking at how genetic variants are impacting these molecular phenotypes, how these are shifting from one space to another space, how we can kind of understand, in the same way that we're talking about language models having personalities that are cross-cutting, being able to understand contextual learning. So Ben Langrish, one of my machine learning students, is basically looking at how we can learn cell-specific networks across millions of cells, where you can have the context of the biological variables of each of the cells be encoded as an orthogonal component to the specific network of each cell type. And being able to sort of project all of that into sort of a common knowledge space is transformative for the field. And then large language models have also been extremely helpful for structure, if you understand protein structure through modeling of geometric relationships, through geometric deep-learning and graph neural networks. So one of the things that we're doing with Marinka is trying to sort of project these structural graphs",

And then we are working with the chemistry department and Brad to basically synthesize those. So what we're trying to create is this new center at MIT for Genomics and Therapeutics, that basically says, can we facilitate this translation? We have thousands of these genetic circuits that we have uncovered. I mentioned last time in The New England Journal of Medicine, we had published these dissection of the strongest genetic association with obesity. And we showed how you can manipulate that association to switch back and forth between fat burning cells and fat storing cells. In Alzheimer's, just a few weeks ago we had a paper in Nature in collaboration with Li-Huei Tsai looking at APOE4, the strongest genetic association with Alzheimer's. And we showed that it actually leads to a loss of being able to transport cholesterol in myelinating cells known as oligodendrocytes that basically protect the neurons. And when the cholesterol gets stuck inside the oligodendrocytes, it doesn't form myelin, the neurons are not protected and it causes damage inside the oligodendrocytes. If you just restore transport, you basically are able to restore myelination in human cells and in mice and to restore cognition in mice. So all of these circuits are basically now giving us handles to truly transform the human condition. We're doing the same thing in cardiac disorders, in Alzheimer's, in neurodegenerative disorders, in psychiatric disorders, where we have now these thousands of circuits that if we manipulate them, we know we can reverse disease circuitry. So what we want to build in this coalition that we're building is a center where we can now systematically test these underlying molecules in cellular models for heart, for muscle, for fat, for macrophages, immune cells and neurons to be able to now screen through these newly designed drugs through deep-learning and to be able to sort of ask which ones act at the cellular level, which combinations of treatment should we be using and the other components that we're looking into decomposing complex traits like",

So that for every one of those traits we can kind of start speaking the language of what are the building blocks of Alzheimer's, and maybe this patient has building blocks one, three, and seven and this other one has two, three, and eight, and we can now start prescribing drugs not for the disease any more, but for the hallmark. And the advantage of that is that we can now take this modular approach to disease instead of saying there's gonna be a drug for Alzheimer's, which is gonna fail in 80% of the patients, we are gonna say, now there's gonna be 10 drugs, one for each pathway, and for every patient we now prescribe the combination of drugs. So what we wanna do in that center is basically translate every single one of these pathways into a set of therapeutics, a set of drugs that are projecting the same, embedding subspace as the biological pathways that they alter so that we can have this translation between the dysregulation that are happening at the genetic level, at the transcription level, at the drug level, at the protein structure level, and effectively take this modular approach to personalized medicine, where saying, I'm gonna build a drug for Lex Fridman is not gonna be sustainable. But if you instead say I'm gonna build a drug for this pathway and a drug for that other pathway, millions of people share each of these pathways. So that's the vision for how all of these AI and deep-learning and embeddings can truly transform biology and medicine where we can truly take these systems and allow us to finally understand disease at a superhuman level by sort of finding these knowledge representations, these projections of each of these spaces and try understanding the meaning of each of those embedding subspaces and sort of how well populated it is, what are the drugs that we can build for it and so on and so forth. So it's truly transformative. - So systematically find how to alter the pathways, it maps the structure of the information in genomics to therapeutics and allows you to have drugs that look at the pathways not at the final condition. - Exactly.

We can intervene at the antisense oligo level by basically repressing the RNA, bring in new RNA, intervene at the protein level, at the small molecule level. We can use proteins themselves as drugs just because of their ability to interfere, to interact directly from protein to protein interactions. So I think this space is being completely transformed with a marriage of high throughput technologies and all of these like AI, large language models, deep-learning models and so on and so forth. - You mentioned your updated answer to the meaning of life, as it continuously keeps updating. The new version is self-actualization. Can you explain? - I basically mean, let's try to figure out, number one, what am I supposed to be? And number two, find the strength to actually become it. So I was recently talking to students about this commencement address and I was talking to them about sort of how they have all of these paths ahead of them right now. And part of it is choosing the direction in which you go. And part of it is actually doing the walk to go in that direction. And in doing the walk, what we talked about earlier about sort of you create your own environment, I basically told 'em, listen, you're ending high school up until now, your parents have created all of your environment, now it's time to take that into your own hands and to sort of shape the environment that you wanna be an adult in. And you can do that by choosing your friends, by choosing your particular neuronal routines. I basically think of your brain as a muscle, where you can exercise specific neuronal pathways. So very recently I realized that, you know, I was having so much trouble sleeping, and, you know, I would wake up in the middle of the night, I would wake up at 4:00 AM and I could just never go back to bed. So I was basically constantly losing, losing, losing sleep. I started a new routine where every morning, as I bike in, instead of going to my office, I hit the gym. I basically go rowing first, I then do weights, I then swim very often when I have time.",

And I just went anyway 'cause I couldn't do otherwise. And that has completely transformed me. So I think this sort of beneficial effect of exercise on the whole body is one of the ways that you could transform your own neural pathways. Understanding that it's not a choice, it's not an option, it's not optional, it's mandatory. And I think your role modeled so many of us by sort of being able to sort of push your body to the extreme, being able to have these extremely regimented regimes and that's something that I've been terrible at. But now I'm basically trying to coach myself and trying to sort of, you know, finish this kind of self-actualization into a new version of myself, a more disciplined version of myself. - Don't ask questions, just follow the ritual. - [Manolis Kellis] Not an option. - You have so much love in your life, you radiate love. Do you ever feel lonely? - So there's different types of people. Some people drain in gatherings, some people recharge in gatherings. I'm definitely the recharging type. So I'm an extremely social creature. I recharge with intellectual exchanges, I recharge with physical exercise, I recharge in nature. But I also can feel fantastic when I'm the only person in the room. That doesn't mean I'm lonely, it just means I'm the only person in the room. And I think there's a secret to not feeling alone when you're the only one. And that secret is self-reflection. It's introspection, it's almost watching yourself from above. And it's basically just becoming yourself, becoming comfortable with the freedom that you have when you're by yourself. - So hanging out with yourself. I mean, there's a lot of people who write to me, who talk to me about feeling alone in this world, that struggle, especially when they're younger, is there further words of advice you can give to them, when they are almost paralyzed by that feeling?",

But activating your muscles, activating your body, activating your full self is one way that you can kind of get out of it. And that is exercising your freedom, reclaiming your physical space. And one of the things that I do is I have something that I call me time, which is, if I've been really good all day, I got up in the morning, I got the kids to school, I made them breakfast, I sort of, you know, hit the gym, I had a series of really productive meetings. I reward myself with this me time. And that feeling of sort of, when you're overstretched, to realize that that's normal and you just wanna just let go.
