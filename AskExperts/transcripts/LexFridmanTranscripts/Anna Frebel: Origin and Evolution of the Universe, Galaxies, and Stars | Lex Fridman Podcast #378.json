And I would just lay there like the snow angel and just kind of let my thoughts sort of pass through my brain. And this is when I personally have the feeling that I'm apart of it, I belong here, rather than feeling kind of small. Yes, I'm small, but there are many other small things. And lots of small things make one big whole. - The following is a conversation with Anna Frebel, an astrophysicist at MIT studying the oldest stars in the Milky Way galaxy in order to understand the chemical and physical conditions of the early universe and how from that our galaxy formed and evolved to what it is today, the place we humans call home. This is the \"Lex Fridman Podcast\"; to support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Anna Frebel. Let's go back to the early days. What did the formation of the Milky Way galaxy look like? Or maybe we wanna start even before that. What did the formation of the universe look like? - Well, we, scientists, believe there was the Big Bang, some big beginning. (chuckles) But what is important for my work, and I think that's what we're going to talk about, is what kind of elements were present at that time. So the Big Bang left a universe behind that was made of just hydrogen helium and tiny little sprinkles of lithium, and that was pretty much it. And, as it turns out, it's actually quite hard to make stars or any structure from that, that very hot gas. And so the very first stars that formed prior to any galaxies were very massive stars, big stars, 100 times the mass of the sun, and they were made from just hydrogen and helium. So big stars explode pretty fast, after a few million years only. That's very short on cosmic time scales. And in their explosions, they provided the first heavier elements to the universe because, in their course, all stars fuse lighter elements",

        "text": "like hydrogen and helium into heavier ones, and then that goes all the way up to iron. And then all that material gets ejected in these massive supernova explosions. And that marked a really, really important transition in the universe. Because after that first explosion, it was no longer chemically pristine. And that set the stage for everything else to happen, including us here talking today. (laughs) - So what do you mean by pristine? So there's a whole complex soup of elements now as opposed to just hydrogen helium and a little bit of lithium. - Yeah, so after the Big Bang, just hydrogen and helium. We don't really need to talk too much about lithium because the amount was so small. And after these very first stars formed and exploded, the heavier elements like carbon, oxygen, magnesium, iron, all of that stuff was suddenly present in the gas clouds in tiny amounts only, only very tiny amounts. But that actually helped, especially the carbon and the oxygen, to make the gas cool. These atoms are more complicated than hydrogen, that's just a proton, and so it has cooling properties, can send out photons outside of the gas cloud so the gas can cool. And when you have gas that gets colder and colder, you can make small and smaller stars, so you can fragment it and clump it and turn it into stars like the sun. And the cool thing about that is that when you have small stars like the sun, they have a really long lifetime. So those first low-mass stars that formed back then are still observable today. That is actually what I do. I try to find these early survivors because they tell us what the gas looked like back then. They have preserved that composition of these early gas cloud, the, the chemical compositions, until today. So I don't need to look very far into the universe to study all the beginnings, I can just chemically analyze the oldest stars. And it's like unpacking everything that happened back then. It's very exciting.",

        "text": "- So to just reiterate. So in the very early days, in the first few million years, there was giant stars that's mostly hydrogen and helium. And then they exploded in these supernova explosions and then they made these clumps- - [Anna] Yeah, so the first stars- - Not pristine. Not pristine clumps? - Yeah, pretty much. - Fun. - So it took a few hundred million years for the first stars to emerge and then they exploded after a few million years. Kaboom. And then it's like I always consider the universe like a, you know, a nice soup. And then these first supernova explosions kind of provided the salt, you know, just a little sprinkle of heavier elements, and that made it really tasty. (chuckles) It just changed it completely, right? And that changed the physics of the gas. So that meant that these gas clouds that were, you know, surrounding the former first stars, they could now cool down and clump and form the next generation of stars that now included also little stars. And, as I just mentioned, the small stars have these really long lifetimes. The sun has a lifetime of 10 billion years. Any star that is even less massive will have an even longer lifetime. So that gives us a chance to still observe some of the stars that formed back then. So we are testing the conditions, the chemical and physical conditions, of the early universe even before the galaxy formed. - So what's the timeline that we're talking about? What is the age of the universe? And what is the earliest time we got those salty, delicious soup, clump soups with heavier elements? - Well, the universe is 13.8 billion years old. - Allegedly, yeah. Is it? So- - Yes. - Okay, 13.8- - Well, you know, when I was in high school, the universe was 20 billion years old. - [Lex] Oh, yeah? So the estimate- - Things have changed. - Do you think that estimate will evolve in interesting ways or no?",

The whole business of precision cosmology by mapping out the cosmic microwave background, you know, that's a marvelous feat. Maybe, you know, the digits will still move around a little bit, but that's all right. - Plus the gravitational waves and all that, so all the different sources of data kind of mapping out this detailed picture of the early universe. Yeah. - Totally. And so we think the earliest little stars formed, I don't know, maybe 1/2 billion years after the Big Bang, right? Again, a few hundred million years for the first stars to emerge and then, you know, took some time, so give or take 1/2 billion years. And that was the time when sort of the very first protogalaxies formed, early stellar structures, stellar systems, from which the Milky Way eventually formed, right? So it was... The Milky Way was probably a slightly bigger one. And we know today that galaxies grow hierarchically, which means the eat their smaller neighbors. So if you are the bigger one and have a few friends around, you're just gonna eat them, absorb them, and then you grow bigger. And so all these little early stars, you know, kind of came into the Milky Way through that kind of process, and that's why we find them in the outer parts of the galaxy today, because they're just kind of (indistinct) and just left there since. - So the old stuff is on the outskirts of the galaxy and the new stuff is closer to the middle? Is there- - Broadly speaking. - Okay. - Yes, yes. - So that's where you would look for it. So maybe just a step back. Like, what is a galaxy? What is a protogalaxy?",

        "text": "- I love that question. So the galaxy is a huge assembly of stars. The Milky Way contains something like 200 to 400 billion stars. And most of the material and the stars are in the disc. And when we look at the night sky, what we see as the Milky Way band on the sky, that is actually the inner, the next inner spiral arm, because we actually live in a spiral disc galaxy. The Milky Way is spiral disc galaxy. And we are looking... Actually it depends a little bit. In the Northern Hemisphere, we're looking out of the galaxy, so we are seeing the next outer spiral arm. And as you can imagine, there's only dark space behind that. So we don't see it all that nice on the sky. But if you travel to the Southern Hemisphere, let's say South America, you see the Milky Way and it looks so different on the sky because that's the next inner spiral arm, and that's back lit by the galactic center. The galactic center is a very big, puffy, you know, region of gas, there's a lot of star formation. The galactic party is happening there, so it's very bright and it makes for this very beautiful Milky Way on the night sky that we see. So actually if you ever get the chance to experience that, I encourage you to almost like close your eyes while seeing this and imagining that you are sitting in this kind of disc, in this pancake, and you're just kind of looking right into it. And you can really feel that we are in this 2D disc. And then you can imagine that there's a top and a bottom and that we're really part of the galaxy. You can really experience that. We're not just lost in space somewhere, but we're really a part of it. And, you know, knowing a little bit about the structure of the Milky Way really helps. - Do you feel small when you think about that, when you look on that spiral on the inside of the Milky Way and then you look out to the outside? Like, how are we supposed to feel?",

I think for many people they think like, oh, there's just the planet and then there's nothing, and that's almost a little bit sad. But that's really not the case, right, because there's so much more. And I really like to imagine, \"Wow, I'm sitting in this big galactic merry-go-round and we're going around the center.\" And I can see the center above me, right? And I can almost feel like we're going, going there. (chuckles) Of course we can't really feel that, but the sun does circle the galactic center. - But there's a kind of sadness to... Like looking at pictures of a nice vacation place, all we get is that light, an old light. Do you feel, like, sad that we don't get to travel or you and I will not get to travel there and maybe humans will never get to travel there? - Yeah, I always wanted to travel into space and see the Earth and other things from up there. There's certainly that. But I don't know. It's also okay to just be at our vantage point and see it from here. - With the sensors, with the telescopes that we have, and explore the possibility. I mean, there is a kind of wonder to the mystery of it all, what's out there, what interesting things that we can't possibly imagine. You know, there could be all kinds of life forms, bacteria, all this kind of stuff. I tend to believe that... You know, it depends on the day. I tend to believe there's just a lot of very primitive organisms just spread out throughout, and they build their little things, like bacteria-type organisms; and just to think what kind of worlds there are. 'Cause they're probably really creative living organisms 'cause the conditions... I guess the question I'm wondering to myself when I look out there to the stars, how different are the conditions on the different planets that orbit those stars?",

I already mentioned the number of stars in the galaxy. I mean, you know, it's a huge number of planets out there. So who knows what that looks like? All we know is that there is a lot of variety. We don't quite yet understand what drives that, what governs that, why that is the case. Why is it not all one size fits all? - Oh, you mean the dynamics of planet formation, like exoplanet formation or star formation, the whole shebang? - All of it, all of it. Star formation remains a much researched topic. We kind of, we definitely know that it works because all the stars are there, same for the planets, but the details are so varied per gas cloud, right? It's very hard to come up with very detailed prescriptions. Broadly, we have figured it out. You need a gas cloud, you need to cool it, something clumps and fragments and somehow it makes a star with planets or without. - But the dynamics of the clumping process is not fully understood. - No, no. And the local conditions are so varied, right? I mean, it's the same with, you know, all people look like people, but individually we look very different. - So even the subtle diversity of the formation process creates all kinds of fun differences. - Yes. So we just don't know how this turned out in an individual case, and it's kind of hard to figure it all out. And to take a look, certainly with planets, right, the chance to ever actually take a picture of a planet is minuscule because they don't shine, so they're really dark. (laughs) So I'd say there's a lot of possibility out there, but we have to be a little bit more patient before we- - Or come up with technologies where patience becomes less necessary by extending our lifetimes or increasing the speed of space travel, all the kind of stuff. Humans are pretty, pretty intelligent, they're pretty- - Sometimes, yeah. - Sometimes sometimes.",

What should we know about our understanding of black holes and their formation? Is that an important thing to understand in the formation of a galaxy? Like, so all the orbiting, all the spiraling that's going on, how important is that to understand? - All of the above. That's what makes astronomy really hard but also really interesting, right? No day is like another because we always find something new. I wanna come back to the idea of the protogalaxy because that actually matches or, you know, relates to the black hole formation. So most large, well, pretty much all large galaxies have a supermassive black hole in the center. And we don't actually know, we don't really know where they come from. Again, we know that they're there, but how do we get there? So if we go back to the early universe, right? We had a little galaxy that just sort of, you know, I don't know, had some small number of stars. It was the first gravitationally bound structure that was held together by dark matter, because dark matter actually kind of structured up, you know, first before the luminous matter could because that's what dark matter kind of does, and it started to hold gas and then stars sort of together in these first very shallow, what we call potential wells, so these gravitationally bound systems. And then the mice grew from absorbing neighboring, smaller, even smaller systems. And somewhere in that process there must have been a seed for one of these supermassive black holes. And I'm not actually sure that it's clear right now kind of what was there first, the supermassive black hole or the galaxy. So lots of people are trying to study that. And of course the black hole wasn't as massive back then as it is these days, but it's a big area of research. And the new James Webb, the JWST, the telescope,",

And there are some surprising results that we really don't understand right now, so... - So to solve the chicken or the egg problem of: Do you need the supermassive black hole to form a galaxy or does the galaxy naturally create the supermassive black hole? - Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think to some degree we can answer that because there are lots of little dwarf galaxies out there. You know, the Milky Way remains surrounded by many dozens of small dwarf galaxies; I have studied a bunch of them. And to the extent that we can tell, they do not contain black holes. So there certainly were gravitationally bound structures, so either you can call them protogalaxies or dwarf galaxies or first galaxies, they were definitely there. But there must have been bigger things, like the proto Milky Way, where something was different, right, what made them more massive so that, you know, they would gravitationally attract these smaller systems to integrate them. So we'll have to see. - How do we look into that, into the dynamics of the formation, the evolution of the protogalaxies? Is it possible? Did they shine? I mean, what are the set of data that we can possibly look at? So we've got gravitational waves, which is really insane that we can even detect those. There's light. What else can we- - So that would fall into the category of observational cosmology. And the JWST is the prime telescope right now to... And it promises big steps forward. This is in its early days because it's only been online like a year or so. But that collects the infrared light from the furthest, like literally protogalaxies, earliest galaxies that light has traveled some 13 billion years to us, and they're observing these faint little blobs.

(laughs) - [Lex] In terms of looking towards the older and older ones? - Yeah. Yeah. And more and more sort of primitive in terms of the structure. But, of course, as you can imagine, if you make your system smaller and smaller, it becomes dimmer and dimmer and it's further and further away. So we're reaching the end of the line from a technical perspective pretty quickly. - But it's dimmer and dimmer means older and older? - Yes, in a sense, because it all started really small. All right? - [Lex] Because it's smaller and smaller, which correlates to older and older. - In that phase of the universe, it would, otherwise it doesn't, yeah. - Just to take a small tangent about black holes, and, you know, because you do quite a bit of observational cosmology and maybe experimental astrophysics. What's the difference to you between theoretical physics and experimental? So there's a lot of really interesting explorations about paradoxes around black holes and all this kind of stuff, about black holes destroying information. Do those worlds intermix to you especially when you step away from your work and kind of think about the mystery of it all? - Well, at first glance there isn't actually much crosstalk. Personally, I mostly observe stars. So I don't usually actually think too much about black holes. - And stars is a fundamentally kinda chemical physical phenomena that doesn't- - That's right.

I've written a number of papers with colleagues who do like simulations about galaxies. And so they're not quite as far removed as, let's say, the black hole, you know, pen-and-paper folks.

You mentioned old light before, yeah, that light is like a few thousand years old, but compared to the age of these stars it's nothing. So to me, that's young.

They probably did not form in the galaxy because, again, hierarchical assembly of our Milky Way meant- - They were eaten. - Exactly. They formed in a little other galaxy in the vicinity and at some point the Milky Way ate that, which means absorbed all the stars, including, you know, these little old stars that are now in the outskirts of the Milky Way that I use to point my telescope to. So what can we learn from these stars? Why should we study them? Now, these little stars are really, really efficient with their energy consumption. They're still burning, for the experts, just burning hydrogen to helium in their cores, and they have done so for the past 12, 13 billion years, however old they are. And they're gonna keep doing that for another few billion years; same as the sun. The sun also just does hydrogen to helium burning and will continue that for a while.

I dig for the old stars in the sky because they have preserved that information from these first billion years in their outer stellar atmosphere, which is what I'm observing with telescopes. So I'm getting the best look at the chemical composition early on that you could possibly wish for. - What kind of age are we talking about here? Are talking about something that's close to that, you know, like a 13 billion, 12, 13 billion age range? - Yeah. That's what we think. Now, there's a small caveat here. We cannot accurately date these stars, but we use a trick to say, \"Oh, these stars must have formed as some of the earliest generations of stars,\" because we need to talk about the chemical evolution of the universe and the Milk Way for a second. So I already mentioned the pristine-ness of the universe after the Big Bang, right, just hydrogen and helium. Then the first stars formed, they produced a sprinkle of heavier elements up to iron. Then the next generation of stars formed. That included, again, massive stars that they would explode again, but also the little ones that keep on living, right? And then the massive ones, again, explode as supernova, so they provide, again, another sprinkle of heavier elements. And so over time, all the elements in the periodic table have been built up. There have been other processes, for example, neutron star mergers and other exotic supernovae, that have provided elements heavier than iron, all the way up to uranium, from very early on.

And that's certainly what came out of the first stars and then all the other supernova explosions that, you know, followed with every generation. And it took about a thousand generations, give or take, until the sun was made. So the sun formed from a gas cloud that was enriched by roughly thousand generations of supernova explosions, and that's why the sun has the chemical composition that it has, including, you know, and somehow the planets where were made from that as well. - So the supernova explosions, the many generations, are creating more and more complex elements. - No, it just goes all the way up to iron. And then it just, it's a little bit more of all of these elements. - Just more? - Yeah. It's one sprinkle, then another, and it just kind of adds up, right? Now, the heavy elements form in very different ways. They're not fusion made. They are made typically through neutron-capture processes, but for that you need seed nuclei, ideally, you know, iron or carbon or something. So the supernova-made elements are very good seed nuclei for other processes that then create heavy elements. And because they cannot be made everywhere, when...",

I thought I thought the really old ones we would not have. So what does that mean if the old- - Ah, yes, important clarification. So the stars that we are observing today, these old ones, they formed from the gas. And the question is: What enriched that gas? So it could have been just a first star dumping their elements into that gas all the way up to iron. And we have found some stars that we think are second-generation stars, so they form from gas enriched by just one first star. That's super cool. Then we find other old stars that have a much more complicated heavy element signature, and that means, okay, they're probably formed in a gas cloud that had a few things going on such as maybe a first star, maybe another more normal supernova, and maybe some kind of special process, like a neutron star merger, that would make heavy elements. And so they created a local chemical signature from which the next generation star then informed, and that is what we're observing today. So all these old stars basically carry the signature from all these progenitor events. And it's our job then to unravel, okay, which processes and which events and how many, you know, may have occurred in the early universe that led to exactly that signature that we observe 13 billion years later? - Is it possible to figure out like the number of generations that resulted in these stars? - Well, we can... We think we can sort of say, \"Okay, this was like second generation or third,\" because the amounts of heavy elements in the stars that we observe is so tiny. One normal supernova explosion is actually already basically too much, it would give us too much of it. And the thing you can never take away things in the universe, you can only add,",

The black holes are probably the closest to that, but they would have taken the whole star. - [Lex] Yeah, they'd take the whole thing, not just a little bit- - They wouldn't take stuff out of the gas, you know? So we have maybe 10 stars or so now where we are saying they contained so little of these heavy elements that they must be second generation, because how else would you have made them? And, again, I wanna stress that the elements that we observe in these stars were not made by the stars themselves that we observe, that's just a reflection of the gas cloud. So we don't actually... I had to say that 'cause I love stars. At the end of the day, we don't really care for the stars that we're observing, we care for the story that they're telling us about the early universe. - Yeah, so the stars are a kinda small mirror. into the early universe. - [Anna] Yeah, yeah. - And so what are you detecting about those stars? Can you tell me about the process of archeology here? Like, what kind of data can we possibly get to tell the story about these heavy elements on these stars? - Yeah, it depends really on what star you find. There are many different chemical signatures. We actually pair up, these days, our element signatures with also kinematic information, how the star moves about the galaxy, that actually gives us clues as to where the star might have come from. Because, again, all these old stars are in the galaxy, but they're not off the galaxy. That's a small but important distinction. So they all came from somewhere else. - So you can rewind back in time to kind of estimate where it came from. - Yeah.

And I had a hunch for a while that these stars would probably be some of the oldest. Because, as I said, heavy elements give you extra information about special events. And, again, finding something that's really low means that must have happened either really early on or in a very special environment, right, because we can only ever add. So if you find something that's incredibly low in terms of the abundance, maybe just one event contributed that, max. So we looked at the kinematics: How are these stars moving? And they're all going the wrong way in the galaxy. How is that possible? Well, it is possible because consider... Well, now we come back to the protogalaxy. The protogalaxy was like a beehive. It just didn't really know what it was or what it wanted to become when it grew up and it was absorbing all these little galaxies to grow fast. Some galaxies, some absorbed galaxies were thrown in going the main way and some came in the wrong way, huh?

So now, 13 billion years later, we're looking- - They're still doing it. - Yeah, A they're still doing it. And, B, we just looked for stars that have low strontium and barium abundances and then we look at the kinematics, and, lo and behold, they're all at hundreds of kilometers per second going the wrong way. It's like, \"Dude, you must have come in really early on from somewhere else.\" So we call this retrograde motion. That's a clear sign of accretion, so something that has come into the galaxy.

I think that would be very interesting and inspiring to people. - Yes, it was a wonderful little collaboration that actually emerged in the fall. So I really like working with undergrads and, you know, grad students, postdocs.

Usually I don't say I find the oldest stars.

Let's call hydrogen X, helium Y, and all the other elements combined metals, Z.\" (Lex and Anna laugh) When I give public talks, I always ask, \"Is there a chemist in the audience?. Let me just tell you, neon is a wonderful metal.\" And they're like, \"Oh, my god, what is she's saying?\" But I'm an astronomer, I'm not a chemist, so I'll get away with it. So if you just roll with it for a moment, all the elements except hydrogen and helium are called metals. Now, if we look again at chemical or the concept of chemical evolution, it means more and more off all the elements, everything heavier than hydrogen and helium, gets produced slowly but surely by different types of source and events. So that's, you know, a monotonously increasing function. And so we look for the stars that have the least amounts of heavy elements in them because that means we are going further and further back in this process, in that function, almost all the way to the very beginning. And that is the first stars, right? They started that process. That's why I said it was such an important transition phase because things were... We call, you know, the post-Big Bang universe pristine, just hydrogen and helium, and after that the mess started. As soon as you add elements to it, things kinda get a little out of hand. That ends in this beautiful variety that we have everywhere these days. - Yeah, and you're looking at the very early days in the introduction of the variety. - Yes, exactly, when it was still a little bit more organizable.

So negative is in the Southern Hemisphere, positive is in the Northern.

They provide an important part to the story in the sense that if we had more than two stars, and by now we have about 10-ish or so, what do they tell us about the nature of the very first stars? And what we found, again, working with the theorists, of course, who run these supernova models, is that... So actually let me... Before I get into this, these two stars had huge amounts of carbon relative to iron. So we usually use iron as a reference element for what we call the metallicity, so the overall metal content, the overall amount of heavy elements in it. - So that's why it's called an iron-deficient star? - That's right. So these stars are incredibly iron deficient, which means there must be of the second generation, because there was... And interestingly enough, there was this discrepancy. A normal supernovae, until then, we thought would get us so much iron, you know, and you would distribute that in the gas cloud and then you would form this little star that we're observing. But the iron abundance that we measured was actually much lower than that. And I already mentioned, you can't take things away. That must mean these early massive Pop III, we call them Population III, the first stars, they must have exploded in a different way than we previously thought. They can't output as much iron because they just can't, (laughs) otherwise it wouldn't match our observations. - [Lex] Got it.",

Because you can always add more in the universe, right, but you can't take stuff away. So our Japanese colleagues kind of came up with the idea of a fainter supernova that just doesn't have a much, has enough oomph, you know, when it explodes, so somehow there's less iron coming out. But at the same time, then these stars showed huge over abundances of carbon, you know, 1,000 times more carbon. So how do you now get 1,000 times more carbon out of these poor first supernovae, right? That was the theoretical challenge. And because we didn't have just one star, but two, that really spurred the field to think about: What was the nature of the first stars? How did they explode? What are the implications? Because if they're not as luminous and bright and energetic, that has consequences for these early protogalaxies in which, you know, they must have been located in terms of, you know, blowing the gas out, let's say, and disrupting the system. So much higher chance for the earlier system to stay intact for longer, right? So there's a whole tail of consequences. And this is what I mean with: We need to find the story, because you do you one thing and (mimics explosion), it's like the dominoes, there are consequences everywhere, and sudden you have a different universe, right? - What could possibly be a good explanation for something that yields a lot of carbon and doesn't yield a lot of iron? - Well, it's not so much an explanation, more like finding a mechanism for what happens in supernovae.

And so some of the material falls back onto the black hole. - Oh boy. - So here is a vacuum cleaner now plopped into the middle, right? - [Lex] Like a temporary one that just cleans up some of the elements? - Well, sort of, right? Because if you think of the... We haven't talked about this yet, but if you know what a star looks like, a massive star looks like in its interior before it explodes, you have hydrogen and helium still on the outskirts and then layers of heavier and heavier elements all the way up to iron. So you have an iron core in the center. And because you can't get any energy out of iron when you wanna fuse to iron atoms anymore, right, that's when the supernova explodes, occurs really. It's actually an implosion first and then you have a bounce of the sort of neutron star phase that occurs in the process and then, you know, star gets disrupted. - That is so awesome. - Yeah, it's like this giant, you know, basketball (mimics implosion) and then (mimics explosion) it all goes out. - So implosion first, explosion after. - Yeah. And so in the process, right, if you make your black hole basically big enough, it will suck away some of the iron because that's the closest in terms of the layers; you hold onto it, you don't let it escape. And carbon is much further out, you let it all go. - Nice. - And so- - [Lex'] So that explains why you can have a big oomph and not much iron yield. - Yes.

If we come back to the formation of the first low-mass stars, right? So we had the hotter gas, just hydrogen and helium, that made the first stars, there were hundred solar masses or so because the gas couldn't cool enough, so they were big and puffy. Carbon then, coming from the first stars, probably led to enough cooling in these gas clouds that enabled the formation of the first low-mass stars. So think about what happened if there wouldn't have been any carbon or the properties of the carbon atom would be different, it would not have cooled the gas in such significant ways, perhaps, there wouldn't be any low-mass stars.

And what do they tell us? Right? And these, as we know, these heavy elements are made in a specific process. It's a neutron-capture process usually referred to as the r-process, for rapid neutron-capture process. We talked about seed nuclei before, right? So we still don't exactly know where this process can occur. So you have, let's say, a lone iron atom somewhere, and it is in an environment where you have a strong neutron flux, which means there must be lots of neutrons around. And,.again, when we talk about the site, we can surmise and ponder where that might be the case. But you have this iron atom and you bombard it with neutrons, and you do it incredibly fast. Now, what happens in the process? That iron atom, you know, you collect lots of neutrons, it becomes really big and unstable. So it's a heavy neutron-rich nucleus that wants to decay (laughs) because it's not stable, it's way too big. And so let's say you add only one neutron to it, that would already make it unstable, so it will then... It has a characteristic decay time that's called the beta decay timescale, so it will decay to a stable nucleus. So the neutron will convert to a proton, and that makes it stable. If you now bombard lots and lots and lots of neutrons onto that seed nucleus within that timescale of the beta decay, that's how you get to this huge, fat neutron-rich nucleus that then wants to decay, right? So the rapid process,",

The neutron flux stops and then all these heavy nuclei, they decay and they make all these stable isotopes that we know of, all the way up to thorium and uranium. - So that rapid nuclei decay is what creates all the- - Correct. And the whole thing is done within two seconds. (chuckles) So just to add to the rapid here, (fingers snap) in literally the snapping of my hand, it's all there. In my talks, I often, I have this nice simulation that illustrates, you know, this creation of these heavy nuclei. And I always say, \"This is the only simulation you will ever see that's slower than real time.\" Because in astronomy, you know, we show, \"Oh, this is how a galaxy forms,\" 13 billion years in 30 seconds. Really short, right? This is the opposite. Me showing you this, the elements are long made. - So where and when does this happen, does this process happen? - So you need the strong neutron flux. - [Lex] That's the clumping of the neutrons at the nuclei? - Yes, that's right. And so there are not that many options, right? So where do you find lots of neutrons in the universe? So it's neutron stars, right? Neutron stars form in the making of supernovae, of the explosions. Okay, so maybe some of this heavy material gets sort of made in the making of the supernova explosion and then gets expelled. Or you have neutron stars, so, you know, if the neutron star... I mean, usually that's the leftover of the supernova. If you have two from a binary pair... So stars usually actually show up in pairs, and so it's not too unusual to create a pair of neutron stars that will still orbit each other after both of their progenitor stars have exploded.

But as we know now, thanks to LIGO, the gravitational wave observatory, I mean, we know already that before, but now it's been measured by LIGO, is that these two neutron stars, they will orbit each other for like forever, but in the process they will lose energy. So that orbit is what we call the orbit decays and eventually the two neutron stars will merge. And that results in an explosive event that has roughly the energy of a supernova, but the process is completely different. And the cool thing is when these two neutron stars collide, they produce a gravitational wave signature because neutron stars are super dense objects, they're like giant atomic nucleuses. So there's a lot of interesting physics happening already. And so if you basically form a super neutron star by smashing two into each other, more interesting physics happens. And that means that there's this ripple sent out, you know, into the space time continuum, basically, you know, the... What do people say? The ripples of space time, you know? It's like you drop a rock into water, right, you see the waves coming. So that's exactly what happens when two neutron stars merge. And this is neutrons galore, right? It's really violent to smash two neutron stars, you know, that are so dense already into each other. And in 2017, one of these events occurred. And the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave observatories, they detected that. And then the astronomers pointed their telescopes in that direction and they indeed observed what we call the electromagnetic counterpart. So there was something seen in the sky that faded over the course of two weeks. And that light curve, that light, was exactly what you get when you create all these heavy neutron-rich nuclei in the r-process. And then the neutron flux stops and then it takes about two or three weeks for most of them, of these nuclei, to decay to stability. So we saw,",

And that's where you get all the neutrons and neutron flux somehow. And then the whole shebang, that happens in two seconds and creates a bunch of heavy elements. - So that confirmed that one of the sites, for sure, for the r-process to occur is neutron star mergers. Interestingly enough, I have to mention this here, a year prior, in 2016, my former grad student Alex Ji and I, we discovered a small dwarf galaxy that is currently orbiting the Milky Way, it's called Reticulum II, that was full of ancient iron-deficient stars that also had a strong signature of these heavy elements exactly like HE 1523. We weren't looking for that. I actually wanted to prove that they had really low levels of heavy elements because that's what we had seen in all the other dwarf galaxies. And I was dead set on showing that that is yet the case again and that that is a typical signature of early star formation. We already talked about low strontium and barium abundances in the oldest stars, right? This is what we had seen anecdotally in the ancient dwarf galaxies that are surrounding us. - So that's an ancient dwarf galaxy? That dwarf galaxy has a bunch of ancient stars in it. - Yes. Yes. And so now we find Reticulum II, and it has these, the stars show the signature of the rapid neutron-capture process, the r-process. And we are like, \"Okay, these stars are located in a dwarf galaxy right now. We have environmental information. They're not lost in the galaxy where we don't know where they actually came from. No, we know these stars who were formed in that galaxy",

Can you speak to what this Reticulum II dwarf galaxy is that is orbiting the Milk Way galaxy? It's going to be eaten by it, presumably- - It totally is going to be eaten. (laughs) I can't tell you exactly when. Yeah, the Milky Way remains surrounded by dozens of small dwarf galaxies. They're collections of stars. Some of them, we call them ultra-faint dwarf galaxies because they now only contain, I don't know, a few thousand stars; very, very faint. - [Lex] But still detectable? - Yes, because they're fairly close. And we detect actual individual stars in them. So I've observed some of the faintest stars, you know, you can possibly observe with current telescopes in these dwarf galaxies because I was like, \"I need to know what the chemical composition is,\" because there are leftovers from the early universe, right? They did not get eaten. So they're still in their native surroundings. It's like getting the lions in the wild, right? I gotta study those and compare to the counterparts that got eaten and are now in the Milky Way. And so I- - So presumably most of those stars, it's not all of those stars in that dwarf galaxy that are really ancient. - They're all really ancient, because actually, as it turns out, if you have a small galaxy... There was a process early on in the universe called re-ionization that kind of heated up everything. And together with some supernova explosions in an early, shallow, you know, bound system, all these little systems lost their gas. It was sort of blown out or it simply evaporated, or both, probably both. And so these systems have been unable to continue to form stars since.",

And nothing has, literally nothing has happened to them. They've just been waiting there for us. - So from a stellar archeology perspective, what is like juicier more interesting, the old stars in the outskirts that have been eaten, on the outskirts of Milky Way, or the stars in the dwarf galaxies? Of all the things you love about the... You said you love stars, so which do you love more of your children? - Hmm, oh, that's a hard one. I mean, I love them all, of corse. They serve different purposes. The stars in the Milky Way, I can get much, much, much better data for them because they're brighter. They're closer, so they're brighter. And that tickles my fancy. (chuckles) - And they have interesting kinematics, presumably. - Yes, and we can get that. And so HE 1523, for example, you know, that one is really bright. Only it's a red giant, so it's intrinsically bright and it's fairly close. And so the data I got for that was insanely good and that yielded this uranium detection and thorium detection. I can never get that kind of data for a dwarf galaxy star, so that's a big trade off. But the environmental information that we get along with the basic information about these stars in each dwarf galaxy is really, really valuable in establishing, you know, for example, the site information, right? Because the galaxy is still there, so nothing crazy could have happened. So actually to close that loop, probably some heavy elements come out of supernovae here and there, but somehow my theory colleagues tell me that a normal supernova just doesn't have enough oomph to really get an r-process going and doing it all. - So you need these orbiting supernova. - We need probably the neutrons star mergers",

If you would've plugged in 100 supernovae into this little system early on, it would've blown apart.\" It would have blown apart past 5 supernovae or 10. So that's a really important constraint that we have, that these systems are still alive, right? So it helps us to pin down where certain processes could have possibly happened. And so it's just a different type of information that we get. - It'd be amazing if we could talk about the observational aspect of this, the tools of observation. So what telescopes have you used, do you use? And what does the data look like?

(laughs) - Can you explain the all-night-long aspect of it? - Well, let me start by saying I mostly, these days, use the Magellan Telescopes in Chile. There are 6.5-meter telescope, which means the mirror diameter is 6.5 meter. That's not the largest that there is out there, but it's among the largest. And I use a spectrograph because I'm a spectroscopist. I don't take pictures. (laughs) And that particular spectrograph at that telescope is actually unusually efficient, so it kind of makes up for the fact that the mirror isn't as large, you know, let's say the eight-meter telescopes from the Europeans or so.

And how does the raw data lead to a discovery of an ancient star? - Well, as a spectroscopist, we have to, I guess, talk for a brief moment about what a spectrum is. Everyone, I hope, has seen a rainbow in the sky. That is basically what we're doing. We don't send the starlight through a raindrop that then gets bounced around and splits up the light into the rainbow colors, we do it with a spectrograph, so basically a prism. So we send the starlight through a prism of sorts and that splits it up and then we record exactly that. So it's a little 2D picture actually of a spectrum. Now, it's not gonna look colorful, just black and white. Different colors have, of course, different energies, that's what we record. More specifically, we record as wavelengths. So wavelengths and frequency and energy, it's all the same at the end of the day. We process that little image in a sense that we do a cross cut and then sum up a few columns so that we get all the data that we recorded. And what we see is a, (laughs) it's a bit funny to describe just with words, but a wriggly line with lots of dips. So the 2D process spectrum, we call it continuum, so it's just a flat line, basically, and then there are dips. So the interesting things are the dips.

So if we come back to our stars, what we're observing, we're observing the stellar surface. We can actually never peer with our telescopes inside, we only ever can go after the surface. And the surface contains, or the surface layer contains different kinds of elements. Every one of those types of atoms, so elements are just different types of atoms, they absorb different photons that are coming from the hot core where the fusion is occurring. And so that means that if you are the observer, you know, with a spectrograph or without, you will see the starlight. But certain frequencies, certain energies of that light will have been absorbed by all the different atoms in the gas, so you see less of them. And so those are the dips. And the strength of the dips tell us, you know, which element was it and how much of that element was or is in the star. So we have many, many, many dips. The solar spectrum, for reference, you know, all the dips are overlapping because the abundance of all the elements is so high, it's actually very complicated spectrum. My spectra really look like a straight line and then there's a dip here and then you have the straight line, again there's a dip there. The sun doesn't have straight lines, I mean, it's just all absorbed in some form or another. But the old stars have so little of all the elements that only occasionally these dips that then indicate, \"Okay, that one at that wavelength was iron.

And, oh, there's a little strontium line here.\" So we have a much easier way to map out this barcode that the spectrum, you know, pretty much is at the end of the day and to then measure the strength of these, we call it absorption lines, to then calculate, with existing codes that mimic the physics of the sellar atmospheres,",

And so it was painstaking work to then take medium-resolution spectroscopy to get a little bit more information and to use approximations and to kind of get candidates that we can then eventually take to the big glass like Magellan to get a high resolution spectrum so we really see the dips of all the individual elements that then give us a final answer: Is it yay or a nay? (chuckles) These days, with another grad student, I developed a new technique to use images actually of all the stars in the sky taken with very narrow filters. So it's like you're wearing very specific glasses that only lets so much light through. And so we can do similar things through having several narrow-band filters, what we call it, to fish out things that have, you know, no absorption over here, so just the straight line, and then a little dip here, so a little something there. And that has proven fairly successful in recent years. - So looking at the entire, looking at broader regions of space? - That's right. Because these stars are a little bit like the needle in the haystack, right? There are not that many left over. And certainly the galaxy has made plenty of stars in between; we need to comb through all of those to get to the goods.",

They probably know that nobody pays attention. No, I'm just kidding. - We're all special, right? So are the stars. - It's good, it's inspiring, even if you're the outcast. In your pristine nature, you still might nevertheless be noticed. I'm hoping the same about humans, if somebody's observing us. Is there something else you could say that's about the challenges of this kind of high-precision measurement that you're doing, so this kind of collection of data, looking, trying to kinda pull out the signal from the noise out there? - Well, that's literally what we are doing in multiple ways actually. So we're trying to find a needle in the haystack and then we find something and then it turns out it's just a little bit too faint to actually get the kind of data quality on it that we would like or that would be warranted given the potential of the star, right? It's like (groans). - So there's always noise, there's always a little bit of noise, and you have to try to say like, yeah, \"How special is this,\" when you're looking at the absorption line? How- - Yeah. So the most iron-poor stars, their iron lines are so tiny that they're literally, you know, almost in the noise. So you need incredibly good data to make detections. And the funny thing is we're looking for the nothingness of, let's say, the iron lines, but then we don't want nothing because if there's nothing in the spectrum, we can't measure anything, we can only get an upper limit. But we'd really like a measurement. So we are looking for the last little bit that you could possibly detect, and that's a strong function of the brightness of the star",

And so, yes, we're often literally stuck in the noise because we can't make the measurement. So actually the record holder for the most iron-poor star only has an upper limit. We can't get enough data on this to actually pinpoint a measurement to then take it to our theory colleagues and say like, \"Give me this little iron out of your first star.\" (Anna laughs) So it's a bit frustrating, but also super exciting at the same time. - So let's go to both side of that spectrum. What's like the most exciting discovery to you personally? Is there a moment you remember that you saw a piece of data and you kind of, your heart skipped a bit? - Yeah, yeah, of course. - Is it HE 1327? - That was definitely one of those moments. I wasn't actually present at the telescope, but we were sent the data immediately from our colleague. And we just looked at it and our eyes got really wide and was like, \"Oh, my god. (laughs) Is this really what we think it is?\" So we had to run some numbers and it was. And these are magical little moments. The thing is, you know, often we have false positives. And so there's always this kind of period, and often it's, I don't know, 10, 15 minutes where you need to make some tests to kind of make the decision: \"Is this really something I should keep observing now? Is this really as good as I think or am I being fooled by something?\" Right? So, actually, if you take a spectrum of a white dwarf... A white dwarf is the leftover core of a star like the sun that has gone extinct. And white dwarfs have lost all their a outer atmosphere, so it's just a hydrogen and helium core. So they look like a metal-poor style because there's only hydrogen helium left, right? But the hydrogen lines that you can see in the spectrum of our stars and of the white dwarfs are a little bit wider than normal.",

(laughs) Is it all about HE 1327 again, just the leading up to it? Or has there been like a... Yeah, has there been like low points in the search? - That's a good question. I mean, you know, it starts with mundane things as in like you won your telescope time, you traveled there, and the weather is completely cloudy, it rains, and you had three nights, which is a lot, and you go home empty-handed. So that's definitely a low point. (laughs) Probably not what you were thinking of, but there is a certain occupational hazard to it. - Which requires a kinda resilience and a patience. - Yeah. And you just gotta learn to live with it. Coming back to Reticulum II, actually, you know, that little dwarf galaxy, that was a run that we had and the weather was incredibly bad. And I had sent my student there. And I was at home, and he calls me at 2:00 AM and he was like, \"Anna, I think I observed the wrong star. I'm so sorry. There is this line there, this europium line, and it looks like a metal-rich star.\" And I was like, \"It's cool. We all make mistakes. Send me the data, send me that summary plot.\" And so I look at it, you know, I was like super tired, and it's like, \"I can't really tell.

We had no idea that this was a thing. I mean, you know, of course we thought that, you know, such a thing might possibly exist because why not, right? Neutron star mergers happen somewhere, crazy supernovae probably too. But we were not prepared in that moment to find this thing. And in the end, the weather was getting worse and worse. And we wanted to see how many r-process stars are in this galaxy. So we managed, by a hairline, to observe the nine brightest stars, but the data quality was atrocious. - [Lex] And the weather affects the data quality? - Yes, absolutely. Because these were really faint stars. And so we were really lucky by making a very tight strategy of getting the absolute bare minimum for all the stars so we could at least take a very crude look: \"Is it a yay or it's a nay?\" We couldn't even say yes or no, just to get an idea because we needed to know. Why was that important? Because we could only observe this system again nine months later. - [Lex] So there's always a window of observation. - Yes, it was setting. This was our chance. And it was going away with the clouds, you know? - [Lex] That was super high stakes. - But we just made it, like, really, it was almost impossible. And it was just... The thing is... This is such a serendipitous moment in a serendipitous moment. The enhancement of these heavy elements was so strong that even in this really crappy data, we could still see the enhancement, right?

Are you excited about James Webb Space Telescope and other telescopes in the future that increase the resolution and the precision of what can be detected out there? - Absolutely. JWST is fantastic already. I am not planning to use it personally, although I think I'm on one or two observing proposals actually. Because similar to what we already spoke about, we're interested in the same thing, we are just kind of looking at different sides of the fence, right? I have my old surviving stars and I concoct these little stories about what the earliest galaxies may have looked like, what the objects were that contributed, you know, energy and elements and all these things. And my JWST colleagues, they try to detect some of these earliest photons from these earliest systems to look at the energetics and other things, you know, what was there, how many, these kinds of things, right? So together we're trying to explore this first billion years, but we do it in very complimentary ways. And so I'm very excited to see what they can come up with and how that helps me to inform my stories better and more comprehensively. - What do you think is the future of the field of stellar archeology?

Is it a population? So we haven't concluded that kind of work yet. - So every metal-poor star is a kind of data point that you can use to improve the quality of your model of the evolution of the early universe. - Yes, yes. And I would say we've made huge progress over the last 20 years. When I joined that field, it was in its infancy and there was this serendipitous discovery of that first second-generation star. And we have filled in the canvas a great deal since then. And this is what I have greatly enjoyed about doing so because there was so much discovery potential. And it's been dying down a little bit because of all the progress. It's on the up and coming again because there's so many large spectroscopic surveys in the works now that will just provide a different level of data that we haven't had before. I'm sort of this of older generation. I have only very few colleagues, I work in small teams, and I observe every single star myself that, you know... Whatever I can, I do myself. I don't generally take other people's data, at least certainly not in the end stage. And, you know, I'm not a big data kind of person, although we're all headed that way. I certainly use data from the Gaia astrometric satellite for the kinematics, for example. But that's personally a new thing for me to use sort of big-sky surveys that are available. So it's still very sort of hand-grown field, you know, where we do our individual observations. I have enjoyed that a lot, but that's about to change. - So one star at a time. - Yes. - I mean, there's power to that, to build up intuition of the absolutely universe by looking one star at a time.",

And there always the danger, if you have someone else's data, that you just don't really understand, you know, the limitations, completeness things, how certain things were set up. And, you know, you get out what you put in, so I'm really particular about that. And it's certainly paid off for me. That's one of the main notions that I try to teach in my classes and to my students, that you need to be able to formulate your question really well because otherwise you're gonna get an answer to a different question but you won't notice that the goalpost has shifted in the meantime, right? So your interpretation can only be as good as the question. If you need to change your question, that's cool, do it, but then, you know, it needs to pair up with your interpretation again. And so knowing, really being in the know about every step of what happens, that leads to quality results, I think. That's why I have sometimes little trouble with sort of big data and statistical analysis. Yes, on average, that's true, I'm not debating that.

Finding yet another second-generation star is incredibly important for me but isn't really going to move the needle. Finding 50 of them or 100 of them, that would move the needle; but that's in order or two magnitudes up. And new search techniques and new surveys may enable that.

And so more and more of that is going to happen. And so I think this is probably true across astronomy, these individual 10-sigma discoveries become less and less. If they were easy, we would've made them already, right? Which means we have made many of them. But really filling in the details is the next sort of level of discovery? Maybe we need to find a new word for that. The hopes and expectations that go along with the word discovery are so enormous. We may not always be able to live up to that. But it doesn't mean that we're not finding out new things, it's just a different kind of quality because the questions have shifted.

And the philosophical question: Do you think we'll be able to understand what was before the Big Bang or why the Big Bang happened? Do you think about that stuff? - Not with stars, for better or for worse, because, you know, stars only probe the time when they were formed, and the Big Bang is surely before then.

So we did this to try to attempt to calculate an age for these stars, right? But they rely on us knowing how the r-process works, how these elements are created, where it happens, and then how those elements get dispersed into the gas and end up in the next generation star. So quite a few question marks. So that's how we got to the age of 13.2 billion years. This is probably not accurate, but this is the best calculation we could do. And the reason why I'm bringing this up is that that was actually the average of multiple elemental ratios that each gave a certain age, and then we averaged that, because, for better or for worse, this is the best we can do. So some of these numbers said, \"Oh, this star is 15 billion years old,\" and then others said, \"Oh, this is 10 billion years old.\" And so I often use that in my class to say like, \"What's the good news and what's the bad news here? Some ratios say 15 some 10, right? Is 15 correct.\" And then I ask them and some people will say something. And so the thing here is that it's an absolutely correct calculation given the mathematical and physical model that we constructed, but does it make sense? No, it doesn't. If we believe the universe is 13.8 billion years old, 15 is ridiculous, yet it is correct. Isn't that interesting? - [Lex] Correct from a mathematics perspective. - Yes, it is not incorrect because this is what I calculated. Nobody made a mistake. Now, we can question whether that's a good model, but that's a separate issue. - So you're saying physicists are much closer to truth than mathematicians? - Well, it depends. - I'm just kidding. - Sometimes yes and sometimes no, right?

(laughs) And this is where things get interesting, but this is where math will ultimately be the winner because we can no longer say this makes sense or this doesn't make sense because the physics is broken down. - But math breaks down too at the singularity of things. - Well- - Or no. - depending on who you ask. - [Lex] Okay.

And they were hired for their low wages and willingness to do diligent and patient work to comb through the big data of the day. So the observatory director, they were carrying out large sky service at the time, and they needed, that data needed to be processed and looked at and analyzed. And so many women, or several dozens, or, well, one or two dozen women over the years, were hired to do this work. And in the process, because they were looking at the actual data and they were smart, even though they had often no formal education, they made a lot of discoveries simply by being in tune with what they were doing.

And she figured out, she calculated that the sun is mostly made of hydrogen and helium. That seems normal to many of us these days, but at the time it was thought that celestial objects are made of the same thing as the Earth. - That's a gutsy, amazing discovery. - Yes. It was later termed the most important thesis of humankind or something like that. (laughs) What a revelation to realize that stars are made of hydrogen and helium, right? And this was exactly the time when people figured out why stars are shining, namely because of nuclear fusion and that it's protons and, you know, the tunneling effect that leads to the actual fusion, otherwise, you know, the protons repulse each other, they don't come together. And so what an incredible time it was back then. And so stars and nuclear physics were very closely related, and it remains, now it's called nuclear astrophysics. And so many women had many contributions to that. Of course prior to that Marie Curie discovered two new elements. Ah, so awesome. (laughs) Radium and polonium. Lise Meitner discovered nuclear fission, that is the basis for understanding the r-process. This is exactly what happens in the r-process. You know, the heavy nuclei, let's say uranium, if you bombard it with a neutron, we talked at length about it, it will decay... Well, not decay, actually. It will fission, it will split into barium and krypton, let's say, so two lighter elements. That's exactly what we observe. I have always a higher abundance of barium than the heavier elements because of this fission cycling",

I you just take that body of work, that changed how we do things, how we see the universe, how we understand things, has led to so many subsequent discoveries, good ones and bad. - Well, all of it just taken together, ultimate progress. - That's progress, right? Science is what it is, we have to decide what we do with that knowledge, right? We can always use things for good or for bad. That's part of the human endeavor as well. - And also part of the human endeavor and the human nature is the issues with corruption and credit assignment and all these kinds of things that make this whole ride so damn interesting, about what's right and wrong and about the nature of good and evil. And that seems to surface itself in all kinds of places all the time still. - Yes, yes. Lise Meitner was nominated for the Nobel Prize 40 times, more than that even. It's amazing. She holds the record for that. She never received it, so case in point. - Yeah. And, of course, the Nobel Prize has its complexities. One is the credit assignment; but two, even in astronomy, sort of assigning credit to a handful of folks when so many more contributed is a complicated story also. - [Anna] Yeah, it's very complex. - Okay, sorry for the romantic question, but what to you is the most beautiful idea in astronomy, in stellar astronomy? - Well, so early on, you know, when I was in high school, I was thinking like, \"Okay, what do I wanna do when I grow up?\" Right? (chuckles) I knew I wanted to do astronomy, but I was a little bit torn because my interests were definitely stars, stellar astronomy, but also chemistry. I always had a fascination about the elements, so Marie Curie was a big role model.",

        "text": "My friend actually made a beautiful, produced a beautiful movie about the discovery of the elements. It's a theater play, but digitized. When I saw it, I could actually kind of relive the sort of discovery moment that Marie Curie had. It sent shivers down my spine. It was fantastic. I mean, this is the kind of thing that I wanted to experience. But, yeah, so nuclear physics and element creation and formation was really interesting to me, chemistry, the elements, stars, and all of that. And I was like, \"I don't know if I ever find something that combines all of these things.\" And then I ended up in Australia, and met this person and he was working on old stars. And as I was sitting in his talk, hearing about this for the first time, it kind of, it clicked all over my head and it's like, \"Oh, my god.\" It all fell in place because we can use these old stars to study the elements, to learn how they're formed. We can get these clean signatures that help us inform the nuclear synthesis processes, you know? And, of course, I need to know a lot about stars too. So it's like all together. And that was sort of a moment of magic. And then the fact that I have now done that for 20 years is just like I won the lottery. - It all clicked into place. And so in some sense it's an ongoing love story for me, if I could say it like that, where, you know, I found my stars, my thing, and I am fortunate enough to be able to keep doing that. And I'm happy to see where it will take me. You know, it's an evolution. As with every relationship, if you don't march forward, you move backwards. I'm not interested in moving backwards, so I'm letting the field and the discoveries and the findings lead me to... You know, and I'm often... It's not hard for me to follow sort of my hunches. And sometimes even at the telescope, it's like, \"Hmm, let's take a look at this one.",

And I really like that, A, that I have the freedom to do that, that I'm allowed to follow my hunches. Too many people, I think, are sort of boxed in with their job or their life that they don't have that kind of freedom. That's really important to me, and I certainly try to make use of that. I also try to teach that to others, to trust them, to learn... You need to learn your things, but then you need to also trust that knowledge and that you have a grasp on it, right? You get out what you put in. And being able to contribute in meaningful ways to our knowledge about our cosmic ancestry, our cosmic history, that's a wonderful thing. (laughs) - And in this way, your personal love story with the stars evolves. What advice, you've already spoken to it a little bit, but what advice would you give to young people that are trying to find the same kind of love story in their career, in their life? - It seems increasingly hard for folks to find that. Sometimes I feel that, you know, young people have all the opportunities these days, and that's wonderful. But it's almost like that leads to some... What's the right word? They're a little bit too tired to make all the decisions because at some point you need to put your eggs in a basket and you need to be okay with that. We can't do all the things even though we're often told, \"You can be president too.\" And I think that's really important to convey. But at the end of the day, we can only have sort of one job or one type of profession. I'm not saying, you know, you need to be locked in, but it's hard to change 180 degrees. And so lots of people, I think, are often afraid to really dig in at least for some time and get the hands real dirty and really learn from the bottom up. - [Lex] One thing. - On one thing,",

I have that feeling very often. There are so many things I would like to do, many things I would like to try to be good at. Sometimes I wish I had a different job, you know, because I have other interests too, but I realized, \"Okay, I can only do one thing.\" So I have no regrets. But this is a general feeling that I would think most of us have. But if it stops you from really digging, drilling down on one thing, to become an expert in one thing, to become really good at one thing that you call your own, then it just makes it difficult. - And so a fulfilling life is in part likely to be discovered in a singular pursuit of a thing, of one thing. - [Anna] Well, yeah or- - At least for a time. - Yeah, for some time, with your heart and your hands. Because I think most people long to own something. You know, we all, I think, wanna leave some legacy of some sorts, you know, for our children, for humanity, for this planet. (laughs) And I think it's really important for young people to strive for that and not lose sight or trade that for all the opportunities because an opportunity is nothing if you don't do anything. You need to do something at the end of the day. So I chat with lots of people about this, and I often start by just saying, \"Hey, tell me what you don't like,\" because it's often much easier to- - [Lex] Just narrow down, narrow down, narrow down. - let out what's not on your plate, and then this way we get a little bit closer. And then it's like, \"Well, why don't you take a risk and just sign up for something for three months? You can afford that.\" - But that's what it feels like. That's what it feels like; and it is that, it's a risk. Commitment is a risk. - Yes.",

If you notice one thing, just stick with it. And then maybe there's something there. - Right, right. And this moment of kind of feeling it in your entire body and mind that this is the right thing, you know, getting there is probably really hard. But if you don't try, you won't find out. - The hard stuff is the fun stuff, that's also another thing to find out. - And then there is that. Yes. - Somehow, it doesn't make sense. You also mentioned that you have taken a little stroll into the artistic representation of yourself. Can you speak to that for a little bit? - Yes. Well, I already just mentioned sometimes I wish I, you know, had more time to do other things. So I find little sideways, I guess, to pursue things that I like besides astronomy, or at least I try to find connections. And so some years ago, I, again, with the help of my friend who made this Marie Curie movie, she and I wrote a one-woman play where I actually portray Lise Meitner who was an Austrian German nuclear physicist. I'm from Germany, so I have the right accent for that. (Anna laughs) And we wrote this play about this moment of discovery of nuclear fission. Again, this is an absolutely critical piece that explains my work today. And we all stand on the shoulder of giants, she was one of those giants. And in some ways it's, of course, a way for me to acknowledge other people's work that have come before me. It's a wonderful way to highlight the contribution by a prominent woman. And the way I do it is it's a 25-minute play in costume where I re-live, for people, the moment of discovery, then I turn into myself and then I give a 30-minute presentation on the r-process and the creation of heavy elements because the audience can now perfectly understand that,",

And it's a wonderful compliment that almost spans 100 years from one woman to the next passing on the torch. And, you know, when we write up our results, let's say, you know, in magazines like \"Nature and Science,\" it's always about the results on the golden platter, perfectly prepared. The discovery is never described, only ever the results. You asked me beforehand, right, \"What does it feel to be at the telescope in this moment?\" Right? I'm happy to talk about this, but it's nowhere written ever, nobody really talks about it. And so having a form of, you know, theater of the arts to bring this exciting moment, that is what we all want to experience as scientists, to a wider audience is so profound and so rewarding. And they all love it because everyone can understand a moment of discovery. I was looking for something and then I found it. It's like you misplaced car keys, right? (laughs) - Or love. - Yes, yes. Everyone can understand that. - Both are glorious experiences, yes. - The implications and the findings, that is much harder to understand for anyone. this is where the scientists' work truly lies, this is our job. But the moment of discovery is easy and it's beautiful and it needs to be said. And so taking my audience on this journey: What is the perils? What are my worries? And then, \"Ah, here is the moment of discovery. Let me tell you about it. It profoundly transformed me. And here's how it went,\" right? It's so good. - And art is a way to reveal this fundamental human side of science. - Yes, it's... The problem with science is that it's people doing it. Maybe not a problem,",

I mean, humans are fascinating in that we're able to come up with these ideas through all the struggle, through all the hardship, through all the hope, through all the search we find- - And so the art is a great way to portray that and to broadcast that, right? I think this is how the audience really should be interacting with scientists, much less about the findings but really more about this yearning for answers, right? \"I need to find these car keys. I need it because I need to go,\" right? It's like, \"Now, now!\" (chuckles) And then, \"Oh, God, here it is. Now I can go my merry ways.\" It's so relatable.

I would love to see it - So far I'm just doing it in person, (laughs) but it's really nice. - I would love it. I think a lot of people would love to see it, so hope you do just that. Let me ask you a big, ridiculous question. You look up at the stars, you look up at the early, early, early stars. So let me ask the big question that we humans often ask and struggle to answer. What's the meaning of this whole thing? Why are we here? - We talked about, you know, the biological evolution requires the chemical evolution for all of this to kind of play out, and carbon played this important role. And, you know, in some sense we're just a consequence of all of these things being the way they are, right? So maybe this is just where we are supposed to be because, you know, the laws of physics sort of work the way they do. And we talked much about the variety of everything, really, certainly, you know, from over here to over there, and things in the vicinity of where the sun",

Orbiting this at a distance of roughly 92 million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descendant life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.\" Thank you for listening.
