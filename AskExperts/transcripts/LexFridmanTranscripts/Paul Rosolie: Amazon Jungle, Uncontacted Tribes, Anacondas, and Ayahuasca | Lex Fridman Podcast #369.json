And we were standing by the tail, and the snake was so big that, I mean, this must have been a 25-foot anaconda dead asleep, with a probably a 16-foot anaconda sprawled across her. And they're laying in the starlight and we're floating on top of a lake, standing there in the middle of the Amazon. And JJ just, I could feel the blood drain outta his face. And as like a however old I was, you know, maybe 20 years old. I just said if we could somehow show people this, we'll be on the front cover in National Geographic and we can protect all the jungle that we want. And so I tried to catch it. Yeah, so I jumped on the snake, and the only measurement I have of this animal is that when I wrapped my arms around it, I couldn't touch my fingers. And so I was, you know, my feet were dragging. And to her credit, this anaconda did not turn around and eat me, 'cause her head was, you know, this big. And she went and she reached the edge of the grass island and she starts plunging into the dark. And so I'm watching the stars vibrate as this anaconda is going, and I had to make the choice of either going head first down into the black, which, no thank you, or stopping and just keeping my hand on this thing as it raced by me. And I just felt the scales and the muscle and the power go by and then eventually taper down to the tail until it slipped away into the darkness. And I was laying there, just panting. - The following is a conversation with Paul Rosalie, a conservationist, explorer, author, filmmaker, and real life Tarzan. Since, for much of the past 17 years, Paul has lived deep in the Amazon rainforest protecting endangered species and trees from poachers, loggers and foreign nations funding them. He is the founder of Junglekeepers, which today protects over 50,000 acres of threatened habitat. And Paul is one of the most incredible human beings I've ever met. I hope to travel with him in the Amazon jungle one day, because in his eyes, I saw a truth",

        "text": "that can only be discovered directly by spending time among the immensity and power of nature at its purest. This is Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Paul Rosolie. In 2006, at 18 years old, you fled New York and traveled to the Amazon. This started a journey that I think last to this day. Tell me about this first leap. What in your heart pulled you towards the Amazon jungle? - From the time I was, you know, three years old, I'd say, you know, it was dinosaurs, wildlife documentary, Steve Irwin, you name it. And when my parents said, you know, nature versus nurture, they nurtured my nature. I was always just drawn to streams, forests, I wanted to go explore where the little creek led, I wanted to see the turtles and the snakes. And so I was a kid that hated school, did not get along with school. I was dyslexic and didn't know it, undiagnosed, I didn't read until I was like 10 years old, like, way behind. And so for me, the forest was safety. Like, I remember one time in first grade they had you doing those multiplication sheets. That was pure hell for me. And so I actually got so upset that I couldn't do it, that I ran out the classroom, ran out the door, and went to the nearest woods and I stayed there 'cause that was safe. And so for me, once I got to the point where I was like, high school isn't working out, I had incredibly supportive parents that were like, \"Look, just get out. Take your GED, get outta high school after 10th grade. You gotta go to college, but start doing something you love.\" And so I saved up and bought a ticket to the Amazon and met some indigenous guys. The second I walked in that forest, it was like, it's like the first scene in \"Jurassic Park\" when they see the dinosaurs and they go, oh, this is it. I walked in there and just, I looked at those giant trees, I saw leafcutter ants in real life, and I just went, \"Oh.\" It was like the movie just started, you know, that was when I came online. - Can you put into words what is it about",

        "text": "that place that felt like home? What was it that drew you? What aspect of nature? The streams, the water, the forest, the jungle, the animals, what drew you? - It's just, it's always been in my blood. I mean, for any forest, I mean, whether it's upstate New York or India or Borneo. But the Amazon, it's all of that turned up to this level where everything is superlatively diverse. You know, you have more plants and animals than anywhere else on earth. Not just now, but in the entire fossil record. The Andes Amazon interface, terrestrially, that's where it is. That's the greatest library of life that has ever existed. And so you're so stimulated, you're so overwhelmed with color and diversity and beauty and this overwhelming sense of natural majesty of these, you know, thousand-year-old trees, and half the life is up in the canopy of those trees. We don't even have access to it, there's stuff without names walking around on those branches and it's like, it just takes you somewhere. And so going there, it was like, you know, the guys I met just opened the door and they were like, how far do you wanna go down the rabbit hole? How much of this do you want to see? - You mentioned Steve Irwin. You list a bunch of heroes that you have, he's one of them. And you said that when you're unsure about a decision, you ask yourself, WWSD, what would Steve do? Why is that such a good heuristic for life, what would Steve do? - He's a human being that, like, everything we saw from Steve Irwin was positive. Everything was with a smile on his face. If he was getting bitten by a reticulated python, he was smiling. If he was getting destroyed in the news for feeding a crocodile with his son too close, he was trying to explain to people why it's okay and why we have to love these animals. And everything was about love, everything was about, you know, wildlife and protecting. And to me, a person like that, that where you only see positive things, that's a role model. - And it's just like an endless curiosity and hunger to explore this world of nature. - Yeah, and an insatiable madness for wildlife.",

        "text": "I mean, the guy was just so much fun. - I gotta, if it's okay, read to you a few of your own words. You open (chuckles) - [Paul] Oh boy. - the book \"Mother of God\" with a passage that I think beautifully paints a scene. Before he died, Santiago Durand told me a secret. It was late at night in a palm-thatched hut on a bank of the Tambopata River, deep in the southwestern corner of the Amazon Basin. Besides a mud oven, two wild boar heads sizzling, sizzled in a cradle of embers, their protruding tusks curling in static agony as they cooked. The smell of burning cecropia wood and singed flesh filled the air. Woven basket containing monkey skulls hung from the rafters where stars peeked through the gaps in the thatching. A pair of chickens huddled in the corner, conversing softly. We sat facing each other on sturdy benches, across a table hewn from a single cross section of some massive tree, now nearly consumed by termites. The song of a million insects and frogs filled the night. Santiago's cigarette trembled in the aged fingers as he leaned close over the candlelight to describe a place hidden in the jungle. That line, the songs of a million insects and frogs filled the night, for some reason hit me. What's it like sitting there conversing among so many living creatures all around you? - Every night in the jungle, you live in constant awareness of that, out there in the darkness are literally millions of heartbeats around you. And so, like, we exist in this, you know, domesticated, paved world most of the time. But when you go out there past the roads and the telephone poles and the hospitals, and you make it out into earth, just wild earth and there's no, you know, it's not like this is a national park, there's no rescue helicopter waiting to come get you, you are out there and you're surrounded at night by, I mean, there are snakes and jaguars and frogs and insects, and all this stuff just crawling through the swamps and through the trees and through the branches. We put on headlamps and go out into the night and just absolutely fall to our knees with wonder of the things that we see, it's absolutely incredible.",

        "text": "- And most of it doesn't make sounds like the insects do. - The insects do, the frogs do, you have some of the night birds making sounds, but a lot of it, everything has evolved to be silent, invisible. I mean, everything there is on the list. There's another line in \"Mother of God\" where I said like, you know, life is just like a temporary moment of stasis and like the churning recycling death march that is the Amazon like. It's been called the greatest natural battlefield on earth. I mean, in any square acre, there's more stuff eating other things than anywhere else. And you go through a swamp in the Amazon and there's like, there's tarantulas floating on the water, there's frogs in the trees, there's tadpoles hanging from leaves waiting to drop into the water, there's fish waiting to eat them, there's birds in the trees. You literally are surrounded by so many things that your brain can't process it. It's just overwhelming life. - Churning death march. Some of the creatures are waiting and some of them are being a bit more proactive about it. What do you make of that churning death march, the amount of murder that's happening all around you at all scales? What is that? You know, we dramatize wars and the millions of people that were lost in World War II, some of them tortured, some of them dying with a gun in hand, some of them civilians, but it's just millions of people. What about the billions and billions and billions of organisms that are just being murdered all around you? Does that change your view of nature, of life here? - I've always kind of wondered like that when you see like a wildebeest taken down by lions and eaten from behind while it's alive and it makes you question God. You know, you go, how could they let this happen? In the Amazon, I find personally that these natural processes make up almost a religion, that it reminds you how temporary we are, that, you know, the botflies that are trying to get into your skin and the mosquitoes that are trying to suck your blood.",

And it's like, it's flowing through you. So the Amazon reminds me that there's a lot that we don't understand. And so when it comes to that overwhelming and collective murder, as Werner Herzog put it, it's just part of the show, it's part of the freak show of the Amazonian night. - I see you in certain moments able to feel one with a mosquito that's trying to kill you slowly. - One with the mosquito is a stretch. - Is it always the enemy? What I mean is, like, you're part of the machine there, right? - Yeah, and it's like fair play. It's like fair play. So we have bullet ants and you know, you get nailed by a bullet ant, and you just go. - Yeah, well done. Well done. - Yeah, today's over, I'm going back to bed and I'm taking a pile of Tylenol. - Do you think in that sense, when you're out there, are you a part of nature or are you separate from nature? Is man a part of nature or separate? - I think that's what's so refreshing about it, is that out there you truly are. And so whether we're bringing researchers or film crews, or whether we're just out there ourselves on an expedition, you truly are a part of nature. And so one of the things that my team and I started doing when I became friends with these guys, this is a family of indigenous people from the community of Infierno and they took me in. And as we got close, they started saying, you know, you can come with us on our annual hunting trip. And I went okay. And it's four guys in a boat, and you don't wanna get your clothes wet, so we're all in our boxers in a canoe with a motor going out past the places that have names, and you're out in the middle of the jungle. And the thing is like when your motor breaks, you are so quickly reminded of the inherent truths,",

And then you get down to this point where it's like, if we don't figure something out, the river is going to rise and take the boat. That's the truth, and ain't nobody gonna like argue with that. And it's like, to me there's a beauty in that truth because then all of us are united there in that truth against like the natural facts around us. And so to me, that's a state where I feel very, very at home. - And the Amazon is more efficient than most places on earth at swallowing you up. - Oh God, yeah. - Okay. (both chuckles) So just to linger on that because you've spoken about Francisco de Orellana, who's this explorer in 1541 and 42 that sailed the length of the Amazon, probably one of the first. And there's just a few things I should probably read. I should probably find a good book on him because the guy seems like a gangster. - [Paul] Yes, there's some great books on him. - So he sailed, he led the expedition that sailed all the way from one end to the other, there's like a rebuilding of a ship. - [Paul] Which is insanity. - Yeah. So because it speaks to the thing, it's like nobody's gonna come and rescue you, you have to. If your boat dies, you gotta have to rebuild it. - Yeah, so they came down the Andes, entered in the headwaters of the Amazon, constructed some sort of raft boat, craft something, and made it down the entire Amazon Basin. Of course his stories are the ones that led to the Amazon being called the Amazon because he reported tribes of women, he reported these large cities, places where the tribes lived on farms of river turtles that they corralled and they lived off of that protein. And then when they came out to the mouth of the Amazon, if I remember it correctly, that just through navigation and the stars, they were able to calculate where the way was back to Spain and make a boat seaworthy enough to bring them home.",

Like, what gives you kind of strength that in these harshness of times and harshness of conditions you can persevere? - Yeah, I mean, you look at the stories of people that are so, you know, these stories of people that have overcome incredible suffering like that or like, you know, what Shackleton did or something like that. And so like when your, you know, your tent gets washed away, you go to sleep and the river rises 20 feet and washes away your tent. And you crawl out and all you have is a machete and a headlamp, literally no bag, no food, no nothing. And you go, wow, the next six days before I reach back to a town is gonna be just pure hell. I'm gonna be sleeping on the ground covered in ants, destroyed by mosquitoes. And then it becomes, you know, am I in any capacity, any percentage as tough and resilient as the people that I've read about that have made it through things far worse than this? And then that's the game you play. - What goes through your head when all you got is the headlamp and the machete? So are you thinking at all? Like, I've gotten a chance to interact quite a lot with Elon Musk and he constantly puts out fires having to run several companies. There's never a kind of whiny deliberation about issues, you're just always one step forward how to solve, this is the situation, how do you solve it. Or do you also have a kind of self-motivating, almost egotistical, like, I'm a bad motherfucker, I can handle anything, almost like trying to fake it till you make it kind of thing? - There was a little bit of that. - [Lex] With your machete in the hand. - I got a sword. There may may have been a little bit of that when I was like 14, 15 years old, I'd like have a hunting knife and my dog and I'd go out into the woods in like the Catskills and survive for a weekend, which my rule was one match.

And at that point there maybe was some ego, but in the Amazon you get stripped down so completely that you, it's like that thing like, you know, watch the atheism leave everyone's body when they think they're about to die. It's like when you find yourself staring up at the Amazon at night and you go there is no hope of getting outta here. I mean, I was once lost in a swamp where it took me days to get out of there. And there was moments where I just said, you know, this is clearly it. There's no ego there, there's just hope. You start realizing what you believe in, and praying that you'll be okay, and then trying to summon whatever you know about how to survive, and that's it. And so it's actually, again, it's kind of a blissful state if you can walk that line between adventure and tragedy and sort of keep yourself right at that very, very fine line without going over. - Ever fear of death? Ever fear, terror? - No, I don't want to die. I wanna, you know, I love the people in my life and there's a lot of things I want to do, but every time I've been certain that I'm gonna die, I've been very, very calm. Very calm, and just sort of like, okay, well if this is how the movie goes then this is how it goes. - [Lex] Almost accepting. - Yeah. Which is reassuring. - You've mentioned Herzog, just to venture down this road of death and fear and so on. There's been a few mad men like you in this world, he's documented a couple of them. What lessons do you draw from \"Grizzly Man\" or \"Into The Wild,\" those kinds of stories? Were you ever afraid that you'll be one of those stories? - Oh yeah. I actually think that it's in \"Mother of God\" where I said I almost \"Into The Wild\"ed myself.

That thing is picked clean in a couple of days. - What would be the creature that eats most of you in that situation? - Probably the vultures. - [Lex] The vultures? - Probably the vultures and the maggots. It's really quick. It's really, really quick. Even as far as like you can't leave food out, you know, like if you have a piece of chicken, you say, \"Oh, I'll eat it in the morning,\" you leave it out. You can't do that, it's not good by morning. - \"Grizzly Man\" for example, like what? 'Cause that's a beautiful story. It's both comical and genius, and especially the way Herzog tells it. Well, first do you like the way he told the story? Do you like Herzog? - I do. I love Herzog, and I love his documentary, the \"Burden of Dreams,\" which is in the Amazon not very far from where I work. And the sheer madness that you see this man undergoing of just trying to recreate hauling a boat over a mountain, is wild.

This just happened like a year and a half ago. Through COVID I pretty much just lived in the jungle for a while. And there was nobody there and there was no support.

And then by morning I was like, I fell asleep, woke up, checked the boat.

And so Herzog really threw himself into that, in that Film, and it's brilliant to watch. - What do you think he meant by the line that you include in your book, \"It's a land that God, if he exists, has created in anger,\" said in a German accent. - Yeah, overwhelming and collective murder. (both laughs) - So he didn't really appreciate the beauty of the murder? - I think he appreciated it, but to him it was very dark.

But I think that for him, it is, I think that darkness is something that he embraces and that he loves.

So this is like the great explorer. We assume animals are like the average of the bell curve, like every animal we interact with is just the average, but they're special ones, just like there's special humans. That could be a special penguin. - It could have been. And I had the same thought where I was like, I found it beautiful how he interpreted it. What I took away from that was I found that Werner Herzog's monologue there was brilliantly dark and also comedic, but maybe irrelevant biologically speaking towards penguins, like, you know, which happens a lot with animals. I find like, there's so many times where I'll find people be like, \"Do you think that animals can show compassion?\" And you hear like a bunch of people that have never left the pavement talking about like, \"Wow, this one animal helped another animal.\" It's like, go ask Jane Goodall if animals can show compassion. Go talk to anybody that works on a daily basis with animals. And so like to me, there's a always a little bit of frustration in hearing people sort of like pleasantly surprised that animals aren't just these automatons of just, what's the word?

They're showing love, they're showing compassion, they're showing hate, they're showing fear. And she broke straight through all of those things, and it paid off in dividends for her. - Do you see the animals as having all those human-like emotions of anger, of compassion, of longing, of loneliness from what you've seen especially with mammals, but with different species out there? Do they have all that? - It depends on the animal. If you're talking on the scale of a cockroach to an elephant, you know, it's like a lot of these things, and I wonder about this stuff all the time.

(Lex chuckles) What are you saying about New Yorkers, man? - Exactly. Point well made. So speaking about communicating with a dove, you first met the crew in the Amazon. You talk about JJ as somebody who can communicate with animals. What do you think JJ is able to see and hear and feel that others don't, that he's able to communicate with the animals? - When I say this is the most skilled jungle man I've ever seen, and I know so many guys in the region. He has libraries of information in his cranium that we cannot fathom, it's just stunning. Like, you know, I have seen him use medicinal plants to cure things that western doctors couldn't cure. I've seen him navigate in such a way that he's not using the stars, he's not using any discernible, you know. It's like when elephants, sometimes you'll watch a herd of elephants and they'll be like, \"Yo, let's go. We're going this way,\" and you'll see them sort of communicate, but there's no audible sound. They'll just decide that they're going, and they all do it. JJ has this way in the jungle of, you know, he'll stop and he'll go, \"Wait,\" and you go, \"What is it?\" And he goes, \"There's a herd of peccary coming.\" And I'm like, where? Based on what? And he's like, \"Just wait, you'll see,\" and he'll sit there. - [Lex] You think that's just experience? - It's incredible experience. It's growing up barefoot in the Amazon. And the gift is that he can speak fluent English. And so when I bring tourists and scientists or news reporters down there, he can communicate with them. He's actually good on camera 'cause he doesn't care about cameras. And like for instance,",

And he was like, \"Uh-huh, and where are they?\" And I was like, \"By the water.\" And I was like, \"The Jaguar is drinking,\" it was leaning to drink. And he was like, that's right.

It's like watching Sherlock Holmes at work. - Reconstructing the crime scene. - [Paul] Incredible. - Does that apply also to be able to communicate with the actual animals? Like, read into their body movements directly into whatever that dove was saying to you, to be able to understand? Or is that all just kind of taking in the complex structure of the crime scene, of the interactions of the different animals of the environment and so on? Like, what is that that you're able to communicate with another creature, that he was able to communicate with another creature? - He knows the intention of pose, he knows the habits, he knows the perspective.

And I felt so bad watching this thing gasp on the sand. And I went, you know what? We don't need this, this is for fun and threw it back.

But they didn't have motors at that time, so he would be pulling the boat. So he became this physically terrifying man. And I met him in when he was in his 80s and he was still living out in the jungle by himself. And I mean, he's seen an anaconda eat a tapir, which is a cow-sized mammal in the Amazon,",

Then he cut his forearm, placed that nerve into his forearm, wrapped it with a dead toad, and claims that it would give him strength through the rest of his life. And continued to be a jungle badass until the day he quietly leaned back at a barbecue and ceased to be alive. The man was incredible. But the secret that he told us was that if you wanna find big anacondas, you know, if you wanna see the Yacumama, he was like, \"You have to go to the boayo, the place of boas, the place that we came to call the floating forest. And so he sent us there and it became like this pilgrimage. You know, in the Amazon, a lot of the creation myths are based around the anaconda coming down from the heavens and carving the rivers across the jungle. And if you look at the rivers, it looks like that, it looks like the path of an anaconda crawling through the jungle, it's even the right color. And so from the reference to the tribes of women, the Amazons to the anaconda mother, everything in the Amazon is very feminine based. Even the trees, the largest trees in the jungle, the mother of the forest, the Madre de la selva, is the kapok tree, and it's just this monster tree, these beautiful ancient trees. And that was the beginning of the transition that we made from me being like, I hate school, I want to go on adventures. You know, Jane Goodall got to do all this amazing stuff. I'm just a kid stuck here to eventually becoming something that had to do with where my identity became the jungle, where my life became the jungle. The secret that he told us opened that door, because when we started working with these giant snakes, it started getting attention. It started getting people to go, what are you doing? And it started allowing me to have experiences that solidified and nailed down the fact that this wasn't just like a weekend retreat, this was something that I was born to do.",

Some geography, what are we talking about? Where is this? - [Paul] So I'm in Peru, we're in Peru. - Which is a South American nation. - Peru is a South American nation. Brazil has 60% of the Amazon, which is unfortunate because anything that happens politically in Brazil has a massive impact on the Amazon. Peru has the western Amazon, and Ecuador has a little bit of the western Amazon. The western Amazon is where the Andes mountains, the cloud forests, which is a megabiodiverse biome, falls into the western Amazon lowlands. And so you have the meeting of these two incredible biomes, and that's what makes this like superlative, incredible, you know, glowing moment of life on earth. So yeah, we're in Peru in the Madre de Dios, which is the mother of God, which I always thought was such a beautiful, you know, the jungle is the source of all life. And so we were with the Ese-Eja people, and they belong to a community that's called Infierno, which was given by the missionaries who when they tried to go bring these people Jesus, got so many arrows shot at them they just called it hell. And so, Santiago Durand helped unite these tribes that were sort of scattered through the jungle and get them status, government-recognized status as indigenous people. So he was sort of a hero, he was sort of a legend for a lot of the stuff he'd done out barefoot with just like a rifle and a machete in the jungle. He had 19 children, and the last one, I think the 20th child that he adopted was a refugee from the Shining Path that floated down the river, and he just took him in. This is just a guy that was a, you know, everything he did, like when he died, the whole region showed up. He was somebody, so just the fact that I know him gives me street credit.

It could have been tough, but I took to it. You know, the jungle, they were very, you know, JJ's teaching me about medicines and we were doing bird surveys and, you know, taking data on macaw populations. JJ was just like, \"You really wanna,\" like, he goes, \"You gotta sleep.\" And I was like, \"I only have a few weeks here, I don't know if I'm ever gonna come back, I'm never going to sleep.\" So we'd be out every night looking for all the wildlife we could. I wanted to take photos, I wanted to see things. And then, the exchange came with that, he was like, \"I'm terrified of snakes.\" And I said, \"Oh, I've always worked with snakes.\" I said, \"I'll teach you how to handle snakes.\" And then we just had this like little exchange. And then when I left, after my first time back in 2006, you know, I said, \"How can I help?\" And they were like, look, you know, we're out here trying to protect this little island of forest that is going to be bulldozed. And the more people that you can bring, the more knowledge and the more awareness that you can bring to this, it'll help. And so really at that age, at 18 years old, I sort of started dabbling with the idea of that I could be part of helping these people to protect this place that I loved. And of course, at that time, that idea seemed like too large of a dream or too large of a challenge to that I could actually impact it. - So what was the journey of looking for these giant snakes, of looking for anacondas? And what are anacondas? - Anaconda is the largest snake on earth. So you have reticulated pythons in southeast Asia, they're actually longer, but anacondas are these massive boas, they give live birth. And unlike a lot of other species, so an anaconda starts off, a little two-foot anaconda, just a little thicker than your finger, a little baby.",

And then they grow a little more and they're eating things like capybara and they're eating larger prey. And then at the end of their life, a female anaconda, you're talking about a 25, 30-foot, 300, 400-pound snake with a head bigger than a football. And these things, that means that they impact the entire ecosystem, which is very unique. - [Lex] Moves up the food chain to become basically-- - An apex predator. - [Lex] Yeah, apex predator. - The apex predator of the rivers, and so. - That's so interesting, just eating your way up the food chain. - Eating your way up the food chain, if you can survive. And like they're constantly at war with everything else. So I showed up in the Amazon, I was like, so where the anacondas at? And they were like, oh, no, no, it's not like that. They're like, you have to find these things. They're subterranean, they're living in the special swamps. People kill them. And so we went to the floating forest after we'd come back from an expedition. We'd caught like a 12-foot anaconda. And now it's become like this like classic photo of me and JJ with this anaconda over our shoulders. And we were like, you know, 12 days out in the jungle on a hunting trip, we came back and we showed his dad. And Santiago looked at us and he was like, \"That's the smallest anaconda on deep dive I've ever seen.\" He's like, you guys are pathetic. - [Lex] Oh man, 12 foot. - And he was like, \"Look, you go.\" He was like, go. He's like, \"I'm giving you permission. Go to the boayo, go to the floating forest.\" And so we went to this place, and we reached there at night. And it was me, JJ and one of his brothers.

And so we start walking across this, and JJ's going, \"These are big anacondas.\" And I'm going, \"JJ, that's a two-foot wide smooth path sneaking through the grass. There's no anaconda that big.\" And he was going, \"Shh, they're listening.\" I said, \"They don't have ears.\" He goes, \"They're listening.\" And it's like, we're walking and we're walking, maybe it's like 1:00 AM or something. And it was just like one of those moments where we saw it at the same time. And we were standing by the tail. And the snake was so big that, I mean, this must have been a 25-foot anaconda dead asleep, with a probably a 16-foot anaconda sprawled across her. And they're laying in the starlight and we're floating on top of a lake standing there in the middle of the Amazon. And JJ just, I could feel the blood drain outta his face. And as like a however old I was, maybe 20 years old, I just said, \"If we could somehow show people this, we'll be on the front cover of National Geographic and we can protect all the jungle that we want.\" And so I tried to catch it. Yeah, so I jumped on the snake and the only measurement I have of this animal is that when I wrapped my arms around it, I couldn't touch my fingers. And so I was, you know, my feet were dragging. And to her credit, this anaconda did not turn around and eat me 'cause her head was, you know, this big. And she went, and she reached the edge of the grass island, and she starts plunging into the dark. And so I'm watching the stars vibrate as this anaconda is going. And I had to make the choice of either going headfirst down into the black, which, no thank you, or stopping and just keeping my hand on this thing as it raced by me.

And then after that we were like, okay, clearly the parameters of reality that we thought were possible are just a tiny fraction of what's out there. That sort of recalibrated us, we were like, okay. We're rubbing up against things that are bigger than we thought were ever possible. And so we were like, okay, now we need to concentrate on this. - So how dangerous is that creature to humans? - To humans, not at all. Our cook's father-in-law was eaten by an anaconda, but like, you know. - Love the way you say that and tell that story. Sometimes it happens. - It happens. I mean, come on, every now and then somebody gets stung by a bee and dies. Like, you know, once in a while it happens. But you gotta have a really big anaconda really hungry.

They don't want confrontation, they hunt in their way on their terms, sneaky, you're not gonna see him. And so with an anaconda, it's like, yeah. I mean the guy who got eaten, like if you're drunk and you go to the edge of the water and you go for a midnight swim by yourself in an Amazonian lake, I mean, whose fault is that? - But if you jump on an Anaconda, try to hold on, then you're safe. - Apparently. I think at this point, the research we've done, I think I've handled or caught over 80 anacondas in the field, and not one of them has bitten me. They always choose flight over fight.

I said I have to catch a hundred non-venomous snakes before I'm allowed to handle a venomous snake, if I ever need to handle a venomous snake.

You could see her just drinking, and the snake just took this long drink, she drank a whole water bottle. And then said thank you so much, and crawled off. And it's like, to me, the fact that people are scared of snakes, they have symbolic hatred of snakes, you know, if someone's evil and sneaky, we call them a snake. And like to me it's like, when I take volunteers or researchers or students out into the jungle and we find an emerald tree boa or an Amazon tree boa, or a vine snake.

It's like, if you hesitate it's more dangerous. So like, you go for it. And I got her, and I was like, \"I got her.\" And then a coil goes over my wrists. And all of a sudden my wrists slap together, and you feel this squeeze that can crush the bones out of an animal bigger than me. And the next coil comes very quickly over my neck. And now I'm on my knees with my arms tied, if I wanted to let go of the snake, I couldn't. And my shoulders are coming together and my collarbone is about to break. And I tried to yell for JJ and all that came out was, \"Ugh,\" there's nothing. And so that's what they do to their prey, you know? So I attacked, as far as the snake knows, I attacked. She doesn't know that I just wanna measure her. - You started out as the big spoon, but then the snake became the big spoon. - The snake very much became the big spoon. I would say I was 15 seconds away from having my entire ribcage collapsed, and then JJ showed up and grabbed the tail and just started unwrapping this thing, and then we got. But now we have a system, now we know, you know. I've gotten more head catches than anybody, so I'm usually point guy. - You're the first, the point guy. - [Paul] I'm the point guy. - Okay. Taking the big risky first step. - Yes. Although it could be argued that there's a similarly large risk for the tail guy because anacondas' defense is to take a giant projectile shit. And so the person that gets the tail is gonna smell like anaconda for at least a week. - Yeah, so it's the least pleasant.",

They have the least pleasant job, but this is fascinating. - But what's really fascinating though is that because they're the apex predator, they're eating the fish, they're eating the birds, they're eating everything. And everything in this riparian ecosystem is absorbing the mercury that's coming off the gold mining in the region. And so anacondas can be indicative for us of how is mercury moving through this ecosystem. And this is a region where we've lost hundreds of thousands of acres to artisanal gold mining where they use mercury to bind the gold. They cut the forest, burn the forest, and then they run water through the sand and the sand particles have bits of gold in it. Not chunks, but just little, almost microscopic flex of gold, and then they use the mercury to bind that. And then they burn off the mercury, and that vapor goes up into the clouds. So just like everything else, it's all connected down there, and then rains down into the rivers. And so the people in the region are having birth defects from the amount of mercury that's in the water. And so we were starting, at one point when we were doing most of our anaconda research, we were learning things like, these animals actually aren't just ambush predators, which is what most of the literature would tell you, is that anacondas are ambush predators, no, they actually go hunting. They'll go find clay lakes and salt deposits and they'll wait there, they'll actually pursue animals. And we were trying to take tissue samples to find out if anacondas could be used to study how mercury's moving through the ecosystem. And so that was really, it became, can we use these animals not only as ambassadors for wildlife, because everybody wants to see the anacondas, but also, you know, what can we learn from studying this very, very little understood apex predator. - And one of the things you can learn is how mercury moves through the ecosystem, which can damage the ecosystem in all kinds of different ways. - Yeah, it's brutal man, the gold mining that's happening down there is. It's funny 'cause we've been hearing a lot recently",

He wanted to see the Amazon fires, he wanted to see some wildlife, he wanted to see the areas that we're protecting. And then he goes, \"I wanna see the gold-mining areas.\" And I'd never gotten in so deep, but we met this Russian guy, you can't go, the Peruvian, they will kill you. Like, our lawyer's father was assassinated for standing up to the gold miners. There was two Russian guys though who had a legal mining concession somehow way out past the machine gun guarded limit of the Pampas, which is where they do all this gold mining. And we got in there and took footage of the desert that is forming in what used to be the headwaters of the Amazon rainforest. And it's like there is a massive global scale ecological crime happening down there that you can see from space from this unregulated gold mining. And the cops can't go there 'cause they will be murdered, it's completely lawless. - What's the machine gun limit exactly? - It's the border of this area that they call the Pampas, which is where the rainforest has been cut and completely destroyed, and it looks like Mars, it's just sand. And inside of this area are gold miners. We tried to get in there to film years ago and there's just a lot of guys with machine guns who don't let that happen. - And what, the Russian guys have-- - The Russian guys had access somehow. They'd come down with a bit of money and they had a new system, yeah. And actually, what was interesting is while I was in there, they're very friendly, and really, really two friendly gold miners. One of them while I was there, you know, he kind of tapped me on the shoulder. He was like, you know, \"Look at those guys.\" He was like, \"Those guys over there\" he goes, \"I just heard them say your name.\" And he goes, \"That's not a good thing.\"",

But the gold miners are notorious for, you know, just whacking people and throwing them in a pile of gold mining leftovers. The Peruvian government has to get the military to go after them. Like, the work we've done with gold miners, converting them into conservationists has all been like, I mean I've seen the Peruvian navy come down and literally blow up gold mining barges, and, you know, it's a war. It's a war being fought in the Amazon. - So it's possible to convert them into conservationists? What's that process like? Or is that like, you say that in jest? - No, I say that in absolute sincerity. We went upriver, up the Malinowski River several years ago, and I think it was 2018. And everyone was like, you are going to die. Like, you will be shot and killed. And the reason we were able to do it with relative safety was that the gold miner that we were going with was the brother-in-law of one of my closest friends down there, our expedition chef and one of the directors of Junglekeepers. And they said, \"Look, you can go, just keep a low profile.\" And so I went up with a photographer and we spent a week there. Dead animals everywhere, deforestation everywhere. I mean the things that we saw were so horrible. And we're living with these gold miners that are, you know, they're getting their gold, they're burning off the mercury. I watched the guy smoking a cigarette, burning the mercury off of his gold with the vapor going straight into his face with his child right there. I mean, unbelievable negligence of just sanity. And then towards the end of the week, the Peruvian navy comes down the river and everyone starts scrambling. And I was like, I'm just gonna sit here with my hands up 'cause, you know.",

You make $15 a day destroying the ancient trees of the jungle? What if we paid you $35 a day to have a uniform and a job and health insurance and security, and you just protect it? And use all of the jungle knowledge you've gained as a logger to protect this place. - Who are the loggers trying to destroy the Amazon? Can you say a little bit more about it?

And so you have these people who, they have a chainsaw, they have a job opportunity, they go out and they cut the trees. And a lot of these guys grew up fishing, they grew up in the jungle, they know how to do it. And so for them it's a way to like, they also love it. So this is the thing, these are outdoorsmen, these are guys that love the jungle. You know, in the 90s we had the mahogany boom where they went out after the mahogany, and you almost can't find a mahogany tree in the jungle anymore. And if you wanna talk about like carbon sequestration in the rainforest, the ancient hardwoods hold like 60% of the carbon of the whole rainforest. They have an outsized disproportionate mess from that ancient density of the wood. And so these loggers go out and they cut the wood that's most valuable and then they bring it back to town and they sell it. And then people like us buy it and put it on our kitchen floors. So the thing is, you know, when I got to the Amazon it was, you know, loggers are the bad guys. And if you talk to a lot of the PhDs that I worked with down there were always very at odds with the miners, at odds with the loggers. And then I'd be with JJ, and JJ would sit down, and he'd be like, \"Hey, let's pour a drink.\" Oh, they have masato, let's all sit down.\" And like we'd all be chilling and throwing 'em back with a bunch of loggers. And then the opportunity through not vilifying these people came to be like, these guys are great. You know, and then of course out in the wild, every now and then something will happen, you'll see somebody's boat flipped over and you go help 'em out and then that creates a certain type of kinship. - So they're ultimately people who love the same thing you love. - Often, yeah. Even if they don't love it, they're people that aren't necessarily looking to destroy it. I've met loggers who have looked at trees they're about to cut and gone, ah, this is a shame.",

Can you tell me this whole situation with Discovery's \"Eaten Alive?\" There's some drama and controversy around that. Can you explain that whole saga with Discovery, with your whole effort? Maybe outside of even the drama, the initial thing, which I now feel you're sufficiently insane to actually do, of being eaten by an anaconda. Is that actually possible to survive something like that? - I mean, if an anaconda swallows you while you're wearing the suit that they made, maybe. But that was in hindsight that was the result of, look, I go to the jungle and you start seeing these beautiful places, these incredible species, you start developing a relationship with these animals. And then you watch it get destroyed, every year we watch it burn, every year, places that are are crucial to my soul, I have seen leveled and turned to ash. And at some point we started going, someone has to do something about this. And you look to your right and you look to your left and there is no one 'cause it's the middle of the Amazon, and the rainforests have been being destroyed since the 70's, it's a cliche. And so we started trying to do something about it, so I started putting a little bit more emphasis on publicity, a little bit more emphasis on getting the message out there. And so I started trying to see how, what was gonna work. You know, you just start firing shots in the dark and seeing. And you know, JJ's going, \"You have to help us do something,\" and I'm going, okay. And so from 18 years old, now I'm 23 years old, and all of a sudden this place isn't foreign to me anymore, it's home. - You're trying to think of all the different ways you can bring attention to this place that you care about that's being destroyed? - Yeah.

So when you find yourself flown to LA as a 23-year-old dude, and you're sitting there with some guy who's like spinning a pen and got his feet up on the desk, and going, you know, what can you show us down there? And you go, I could show you the biggest anacondas in the world and we could talk about mercury and bioaccumulation, and we could show people how these animals are misunderstood. And we go on a big expedition and we could be the coolest show ever. And he goes, \"Yeah, not good enough.\" And you go, okay, and so that cycled through a bunch of times. And someone at some point in one of those meetings said, \"What if we show people that anacondas really can eat humans?\" And I went, how is that a good show? You want me to feed someone to an anaconda? And I said, and I kind of joked, I was like, the only way that's feasible is if you make a suit with a breathing apparatus and let the snake eat you and then come back out safely and make sure you don't hurt the snake. And they were like, \"Kid, you're on.\" And I was like, \"Oh shit.\" - So I should mention as a small tangent. I think I mentioned to you offline due to travel troubles, when I traveled to the totally wrong part of the United States on my way to Boston. And on my way to Boston I did a conversation with Mr. Beast, Jimmy. And I got a chance to hang out with him for the day, and one of the things we did is have a lengthy brainstorm session with his team, or I was observing it. But it was interesting because he's probably way better at that conversation that you had with the guy in LA than the guy in LA, obviously because he's revolutionizing entertainment and he's also doing philanthropy which he's trying to figure out how to help the world with that kind of stuff.",

Well, how do you get people to watch something that's, you know, we all change a channel when they show us the kids in Africa with the swollen stomachs, nobody wants to see it. And it's like, with the rainforest that like, we know, we know, we know. And I'm going, I could give data all day long. I could show photos of burning forest, and so I was looking for what would do it. And so the \"Eaten Alive\" thing, without spending too much time on a massive misstep was I agreed to do it.

I was young, I got brought to Hollywood and I got spit out the other side, and that's on me, that's not their fault.

So when there's two people having sex, there's a third person that ensures that on film, so it's not real, but there's still intimacy, that there's a third person that ensures that like everyone is comfortable and the actors say that this always ruins the chemistry of the scene. (chuckles) It's a very Hollywood thing, I understand there's creepy people and so on. - [Paul] Thanks, Harvey Weinstein, by the way. - It's usually I think comes from the director pushing things too hard.

So, in 2019, the Amazon fires started popping off and we had just gone to film like a month earlier, we'd filmed like a small documentary. And they had been following me as if I was on a solo, which we did the best we could, I lived on my own.

And I went out there with my phone, which overheated in like two minutes and said, you can't use it. But for a second I was out there in the flames, picking up animals and throwing them off to try and just get them cooled off, I was trying to get snakes outta there, everything, the birds are flying, and I fucking lost it. I was red-eyed, I was crying and I was going, \"This is happening every fucking day.\" I was screaming, and it's the first time that I'd done that 'cause I've seen the burning so many times and I just lost it that day. And I don't know what made me pull out my phone 'cause usually in those intense moments I say forget the documentation, this is real life. We got stuff to do and I'm doing, I'm not documenting. And then a month later I'm home and I'm in New York, and all of a sudden I see these articles like, you know, the Amazon's burning worse this year than it was last year, and blah, blah blah.

My phone was on a hundred percent and I put on top of the refrigerator and I went to bed. And I woke up in the morning and my phone was on the floor on 2% and it was ringing off the hook, and it was like the news. And they were like, \"Are you the guy",

And that's where we went from barefoot in the Amazon to all of a sudden, you know, I was a talking head for three weeks and going around on all these news stations, and all of a sudden I was like the spokesperson for the Amazon. JJ's calling me, and he was like, \"Go, go, go, go, go.\" Like, \"Get us that support.\" And it was just, you know. So communicating with people and bringing them into that reality, and whether it's rhino poaching and elephant poaching, or the Amazon being destroyed, it's like, to me, it's like being able to take people into that is something that I would love to do. - Yeah, and you do it directly with authenticity on your Instagram. People should definitely follow your Instagram, I think Rogan follows your Instagram too. - Well, the end of that story actually kind of involves him. 'Cause I went to all these news outlets and I was living in green rooms and traveling around and I was all strung out and I hadn't seen anybody I actually know in a few weeks, which was starting to get to me. And I finally got home and I went to like a family party, and everyone was like, \"Dude, it's been crazy.\" And I was like, yep. And then I left, and my cousin Michael calls me and he's screaming, and I'm going, \"What, what?\" And he goes, \"Joe Rogan just shared it. Joe Rogan just shared it.\" - [Lex] Oh, nice. - And everyone was losing their shit and it was so amazing. And it was like, that's when it really took off. And what happened as a result of all of this is that a Canadian entrepreneur who started Lightspeed reached out. And several months later, after COVID, after that boom, I'd been in the game for maybe 13 years or something, had no money, no savings, no job, no nothing. And after that great publicity thing, nothing happened. The waves came and everything got real exciting, everybody reached out and they said, \"We care so much.\" Nothing happened, though. You know, we can run into battle, but if we don't have arrows in the quiver,",

I said I give up. This is stupid. I said the ecotourism business is done, Junglekeepers is dried up. We're done. And then this guy Dax Dasilva called me on the phone and said, \"Listen, I'm in. What do we gotta do?\" And so if the analogy was me and JJ and a few other people trying to hold this boulder back from just destroying the rainforest, all of a sudden Dax comes in like a titan and just puts his arm out and just goes, \"I'm gonna help.\" And he gave us the funding to start actually developing a ranger program, to start actually bringing loggers to be protectors of the forest, to be supporting smaller conservation things. And now we're protecting 50,000 acres of rainforests, we're protecting entire streams and ecosystems that I love, and we're soon gonna double that. And it's like this whole thing, so yeah. The communication of these things is crucial, and I actually think it's incredible that social media's played such a big role in it. - Well, I mean just 'cause I know Joe well and I love him so much, I definitely think you should do his podcast but also just be friends with him, I think you guys. He's one, you know, not to meme, but he's one with nature. And I'm much more with the, I'm one, while I do appreciate and love nature, I also love technology and robots and so on. So we're in that meme type of way, we're very, very different. - Well, either way, at some point make sure you tell the guy thank you because it definitely really helped push us over that limit where, you know, if enough people see it, you get someone like Dax who who says, \"I can help and I have the resources to help,\" and that changed our whole lives. - Changed everything.

I'll tell you some elephant stories then you'll then you'll wonder why I'm still alive. So JJ started, and Santiago, his dad, started challenging me to do solos, go out alone into the wild style. You know, I'd have a hammock, a headlamp, three days worth of food, some fish hooks, a machete, and that's it. And so, like one of the stories that happened early on was I was out there and it was raining, and I was lost. This is how we test your jungle knowledge. Can you survive out there? Do you know how to find food? Have you listened to the things that we taught you? And there was one night that I was in a hammock and a jaguar came up, and I was asleep when it happened. And she came up right next to my head and she was (imitates jaguar panting) and I could hear her smelling me. And then my first instinct was to turn on my headlamp, and just the sound of my arm moving against the material, and she just (imitates jaguar growling). Right here, I could feel her breath, and I just laid there in the dark. And that's one of those moments where you go, you really learn a lot about yourself, because I wasn't scared, I felt like I understood the intentions of the cat. If she was hunting, I'd already be dead, she was curious. And I was lost, and I didn't know if I was ever gonna get outta that jungle, but what she did was energize me 'cause it was an experience like the giant anaconda where I said this is so wild that it's so almost cinematically outside the realm of what I thought my life could be like that it made me, like, wait, 'cause the previous day I was lost, tired, confused, kind of devastated, tail between my legs. After that, I was like, \"Man, you've been waiting for this your whole life. Go get it.\" And I woke up, and I was like I am gonna navigate. Even though I've been in this swamp for three days, I'm gonna find my way outta this swamp.",

That was a sign that you know what you're doing. - [Paul] It really felt like a sign, I really did. - How do you survive in a solo, solo hike through the jungle? What are the different components, what are the different dangers? So you said you had a hammock, you had some food. What kind of food, by the way, are we talking about? - Nuts, stuff that won't go bad, because you can't, so you can't really start a fire in the Amazon. Like, I'm a good, I mean I camp all over the place, I'm a wilderness guide. Starting a fire in the Amazon is futile, in fact a lot of survival manuals will tell you don't do it, 'cause if you're really lost, it'll break your spirit. You're not gonna be able to do it. - [Lex] That's dark. - They're like, \"Don't even try it.\" But you can still get like hypothermia if you get wet and you lay out in the jungle, exposure can still get you, so you want fire. In the beginning I used to bring like ramen noodles, which is, nutritionally, is irrelevant. And so I started bringing like nuts and then supplementing that with fish, which forced me to become a very good fisherman. Now of course JJ knows that he can like, they can cut certain roots and they bash it up and they put it in the stream and the fish just float to the top, and they take. He's got all the cheat codes, whereas I'm sitting there with a hook. He'll go, \"Now, find bait,\" and I go bait. In the most competitive ecosystem on earth, good luck finding a worm. You can't do it. What does JJ do? He takes the machete, looks at his foot, cuts a slug of callous off of his heel 'cause he's got this thick rhino skin. Puts that on the hook, catches a six-inch fish, chops it in half, puts it on a bigger bucket. And in 15 minutes he's got a four-foot giant catfish that could feed a family of 16.

And so if I have some nuts, I can shove in a few, enough calories to get me through the night, and leave a fishing line out and there'll be something there in the morning. But yes, I can start a fire but a lot of times what I'll do is I'll bring a flask and not with alcohol but with diesel. And so you have a tuna can and you put the diesel. This is what the local guys do. Everything I do, you know, I'm sure there's gonna be someone listening to this and they're like, \"How could you do that?\" And it's like, this is what we do down there, sorry. It's a tuna can, you pour a little bit of diesel in it. It burns slow, you light it and you put your sticks, you make a pyramid over that, and eventually that will burn through the moisture. And finally you'll get a very reluctant little fire enough to burn, you know, to make yourself like a cup of tea or to pour that into the noodles, something, something, or you just eat a fish raw. - How important is it to stay dry, is it basically impossible? - It's impossible to stay dry, you're wet all the time. You're wet all the time. - What does that mean? That means infections are more efficient? - Yeah. I don't know if you saw the picture in my book where I have the - [Lex] Yellow spots? - Yeah. - So yeah, there's a picture with your entire face consumed with yellow spots, it's basically, I guess, that's MRSA? - [Paul] Yeap. - Oh boy.

And so when I started like noticing that I had an infection, I think I had dengue at the time too, I went back to town, probably picked up MRSA in the hospital where I got tested. Came back into the jungle and then got progressively sicker and sicker and weaker and weaker as I was two weeks, three weeks in the jungle. And it got to the point where my vision went black and white and I passed out one day. I don't know why, but at the time I had shaved that day. And when I woke up the next morning, I couldn't open my eyes because the pus had come outta my eyes and the pores in my face, all those little microcuts, and the pillow was stuck to my face. I was stuck upriver with no help at 19 years old. And also when you see that picture, you can imagine that I assumed that my life was over 'cause I didn't know what it was, or at the very least I figured I'd be disfigured the rest of my life, I didn't think there was any getting better from that. And so I remember sitting by the side of the river praying that a boat would come by, but it was the rainy season, there aren't gonna be any boats 'cause the river's psychotic. And so, it was a long time before I got back to town, and I didn't wanna leave the anteater, but it became like, I was like, I realized I was dying. And then I finally got a boat with some loggers, a death boat, just loaded with, these guys had gone into the jungle and shot everything they could and taken all the babies and they were gonna go sell them. And so it was like baby monkeys and toucans and birds in cages and pieces of crocodiles and anaconda skins and jaguar skins rolled up. And it was just like, I was just laying there with all these dead animals in the boat with all the flies on my face. Got back to the hotel, called my mother, said, \"Please book me a flight out like today, like today.\" And then I sat on the plane. Somebody sat next to me on the plane, and I had a hood on.

But the thing is now JJ taught me that there's like three different trees that can cure infections, I didn't know this at the time, I didn't know the cheat codes. Now, if you have a small infection, you can use sangre de grado and it'll cure it right away. Like, let's say you have a botfly and it gets a little pus-y, there's a fly living in your skin, you put that on there, not only will it kill the fly, but it'll heal the infection. Now if you have a worse infection, you can go to ojé, which is ficus insipida and you can use that. And that will completely heal, that will murder, it's like crocodile blood, it will murder infections. So like, forget neosporin, that's a joke, these are heavy chemical compounds running through these trees, and they know all about 'em, and so whatever it is. So now at this point, that's no longer an issue because we know how to handle it, which at that time if JJ had been there, I would've been fine. - Well, you learned the hard way. So these are open wounds and then there's creatures that start living in them? Basically, what is it? - Well, that's separate, that's botflies. Yeah, there's a creature that unfortunately, very, very, very unfortunately likes to make its home inside the flesh of mammals. And so the flies attach their eggs to mosquitoes, the mosquitoes go and seek out warm-blooded animals. The eggs, microscopic eggs fall into your skin and then begin to grow. And sooner or later you feel a twitch, and it's a worm living inside of you that's like vertical down in you and it's eating you. And at first it's not a problem, but when they get to about as thick as that pen, it starts to hurt 'cause you got a hole in you.

So how do you take it out? - You have to come. - [Lex] A hundred percent. - You gotta put an irritant. So like, a lot of times what we'll do down there is someone will take a massive drag of a cigarette and then they'll power exhale and get some of the tar, which also shows you how much tar you get out of a cigarette and then with a knife you put that right over the hole. And then you slap some vaseline or something on top of that so they can't breathe. And eventually over the course of a few hours, they'll come up enough looking for air and then you gotta grab 'em with a tweezer and try not to rip him cause then you're gonna get an infection, and you gotta squeeze from the butt, it's a whole ceremony.

I mean the jungle water's clean, we drink it.

They're this, you know, German shepherd sized thing with Wolverine claws and these giant Popeye forearms. And they excavate ant and termite mounds, and they have this long tongue. And their baby's ride on their back for the first six months of their lives. And so they actually have this incredibly intimate relationship with their young, and it just so happened that this animal that I was wildly fascinated with, there was an orphan on the river, and JJ was like, \"You love these things?\" And I was like yeah. So he went and he was like, \"Hey, my friend, you should,\" he got me the baby. And we were, like, we're gonna rewild her. And so I spent like weeks and weeks and weeks just like with this thing on my back, crawling through the jungle, teaching her to find ants, giving her milk, falling asleep with her on my chest. And their tongue is like 11 inches long at that age, and so when she wanted me to wake up, she'd fired up my nose and it would come out my mouth. And then if I tried to get her off me quick, she'd stick the claws in. And you know, on all my clothes I have old, you know, now they're like museum pieces with rips in them from Lulu's claws. - She was able to also communicate emotion and feeling and all that. - She needed it, she needed it. So if this animal didn't have the physical touch, if I didn't hold her all day long, she'd throw tantrums, she'd go shred something, she'd go pull down the curtain, she'd go ruin the woods. She'd start literally having traumatic response to not having intimacy, which was shocking, 'cause again, on the scale of a cockroach to an elephant, you go, I didn't know that giant anteaters had such intense emotions, like,",

And it's different, it's very different. And you realize like, just like a person's public persona when they're out on the street in Manhattan, is gonna be very different than when you're on the couch with them on a Tuesday night.

And when you look at an elephant, so there's this question that keeps coming up of, are we smart enough to know how smart animals are? Can we interpret the intelligence that we're seeing? I lived with a semi-wild herd of elephants in India for a while, and some of the things that I saw changed how I view reality, to be honest with you. 'Cause you know, you watch a matriarch of an elephant herd walk up to someone that none of us knew was pregnant and her trunk goes to her stomach, and then she calls all the other ones over.

And so it was like caring for elephants that were wild, that were sometimes getting shot at by farmers, 'cause if they went to try and rob some bananas. So these are sort of like delinquent elephants that were half wild and the forest department was thinking about, you know, getting rid of them, which, whatever that meant. I made really good friends with this one elephant, his name was Dharma. And Dharma had the... It's hard to write the book I'm writing right now because none of it sounds real. He grew up around people because he was a tuskless male, so he couldn't hang out with the females 'cause he was a grownup male, and he couldn't hang out with the males, the bulls, because he couldn't defend himself when they roughhoused and everything. So, Dharma would be like wandering around the forest not knowing who to hang out with. And so like, there was one night there was a tiger calling and we just heard (imitates tiger roaring) you could hear it echoing over the hills. And what does Dharma do? 2:00 AM, we hear Dharma show up. And same thing, he starts throwing a tantrum, he starts pulling shit over, takes a chair, throws it. We had bananas in the truck.

There was nothing I could do. And so a lot of my job was taking him out into the forest and you know, spending a little bit of time with him. I have this beautiful, one time I set up the tripod and I went, and I was just journaling. And he would come and he would just play with my hair and he'd be like, \"Hey, what's up? He wanted someone to interact with on an emotional level. And when you think about elephants in terms of the fact that, you know, people go, oh, they use medication to induce labor. It's like, yeah, that's not that surprising. They hold the bones of the dead, it's like, yeah, they have the best smell of pretty much any animal, that's also not surprising. They probably know exactly who that was, that bone. But they can navigate to waterholes and communicate in ways that we cannot really figure out. And so when you hear about people measuring elephant intelligence, you'll hear about scientists being like, \"Oh well, we gave it a bucket with a hole in it, and then it had like a key and there was a rope.\" And you're like, bro, this is all human stuff. Can you go walking with them for three weeks in the wild and watch how they deal with the problems that they encounter in the forest? And so elephants have become, especially recently with the work that I've been doing in Africa with VETPAW I've just become so fascinated with elephants. The African elephant population right now is down at 2% of what it was a few hundred years ago, we're really putting them on the brink of, you know. There's some elephants that are being born tuskless because poaching has taken down the great tuskers to the point where now it's actually beneficial for some elephants to not have tusks 'cause then they won't have humans. That's like we've created deformed elephants. And so now I'm gotten very concerned with issues of elephants.",

They'll break a branch and they'll be like, \"This is a good branch, I'm gonna eat the hell out of this\" and they'll like hang it on their tusk, and they'll grab a bunch of other stuff, they'll like hold it. You know, ripping a tree up out of the ground. I just watched it. Two weeks ago, I was watching an elephant, he got down on his knees and stuck his tusk into the ground and like leveraged up. He, like, archimedes this root out of the ground and then was like, that's a sweet root. And then when he left, I went, and I tasted the root and it was like sweet ginger. And I was like, I have no idea what this is but he knew it was good. - Do they use tusk for sexual selection? Like, to impress the ladies, or no? - It's certainly involved in who has mating rights. - [Lex] Oh, who wins in the contest. - I mean, if you got the big tusks, and there are elephants out there, like the mammoth, big tuskers that have tusks down to the ground, like, huge. And when you see them, it's like seeing something unique on earth, unique in history 'cause we're at a point where we might lose those. There are only a few of them left and then they're so prized by hunters. - Yeah, it's interesting 'cause I forget what the actual conclusion on that is 'cause there's some studies of the use of the value of beauty in evolution, like birds and peacocks and so on, that there's no actual value to it but it plays a role in sexual selection. Meaning value, like, it's much easier to understand competition, like a tusk helps you defeat the competitor. - [Paul] It's a tool. - But I bet you there's a component to the tusk where the ladies go, \"Goddamn, that's a nice tusk.\" Like, there's a visual beautiful component, maybe not, I don't know. - But what if beauty though, as we're defining it though, is symmetry",

(chuckles) The least sexually desirable object in the universe. Okay. Speaking of elephant intelligence and something I think and work quite a bit on, as with artificial intelligence, is what the philosophical question that comes up is what is intelligence? What is intelligent? Humans, homo sapiens are often thought to be highly intelligent, that's the reason they stand out. In your understanding of different species like the elephant, what stands out to you about humans? Or are they just another animal with different kinds of intelligence? - Well, we're certainly unique because we have altered the entire planet. You know, the term the Anthropocene, I mean, it's like we've literally created a geological layer of us, whereas other animals don't. And going back to elephants, it's like they also engineer their environment. If you're in a forest, like if you drop me in a forest on earth, I could tell you in two seconds if there's elephants there because there's twisted branches and excavated earth, they're constantly gardening. But I mean, look at us. I mean we're clearly unique in nature, which makes me not understand the anti-human sentiment that so much of environmentalism has about like we're bad, we're damned, we ruin everything.

You know, a saltan, an Egyptian king, George Washington, you know, and be like, you can fly. I mean, just on my way here, and I fly way too much, but I was looking out the window at the clouds and going, \"This is unbelievably spectacular. It's just stunning.\" You know, as a kid, you look at a cloudy day and you go, \"The world is like this today.\" And then you get in a plane and you fly above the clouds and it's sunny up there and you go, oh.

There's somebody I forgot who told me this idea that there's something about the atmosphere, earth's atmosphere that allows you to look up and see the stars. Like if we didn't have that, human civilization would not have happened, meaning like, being able to look up and see something out there. Like, something that allows you to look up versus just look down, looking at your local environment, be able to like wander and see, holy shit, there's a big world out there, and I don't know anything. If you're able to look up and see that, that kind of humility combined with the ability to dream about exploring, maybe it just inspires the exploration.

In terms of humans, you've said that the tribes, some of them uncontacted can be exceptionally dangerous. What's your experience with them? What should people learn? Because it's such a fascinating part of life here on earth that there's tribes that don't have much or any contact with the quote, unquote \"civilized world.\" - Most of the people that I meet don't actually really understand how isolated these people are or how weird it is that we're sitting here and that we have iPhones and airplanes and all this stuff and these people are living naked in the forest at this moment. The thing though, you know, and I also was recently somebody showed me all this like paleolithic tribes, and it's like, no, no. Just by default they're modern tribes living now, they just happen to be living out in the jungle. And there's a huge debate about do we try and contact them and bring them in? And there's two camps of people on this who they say that it was the trauma of the rubber boom that sent them out that far into the forest and made them terrified of the outside world. And so that's also what made them so hyper violent. One of the guys we work with on our team, Victor, was in, I think it was 2004, he's coming downriver and he had a load of mahogany wood. And he's piloting this boat. And he sent two people, husband and wife, ahead to go start cooking breakfast on the beach so they could put the little kitchenette thing down and put the propane.

And as she's floating down the river, she looks back and the last thing she sees is these guys getting to her husband and beginning to rip him apart. As Victor comes down the river, this is a guy we work with every day, he comes down the river and sees his friend disemboweled, opened up, dissected, his parts are all over the beach, the beach is red. And they only found out what happened because they found her later on holding onto a stick in the river and they were like, what happened? And she was like, \"They just attacked.\" They don't want people on their land. On the sort of the underground WhatsApp chain of the Amazon, a few, in August, like this was not internationally known, some loggers went up and tried to steal a few trees from where the tribes were. And then everybody sent the pictures of what the loggers looked like after a few days because the tribes porcupined them with arrows. They were laying there on the ground with just arrows sticking outta their bodies. And then eventually the authorities came out and looked, and there was just these white body, I'll show you the pictures later, there's just these white puffy bodies with like the skulls sticking out. And it was like, you don't mess with these tribes. - I wonder what's the mythology around, that they construct around who these outsiders are? Are they gods, are they demons? Are they humans? Who are they? Who are we to them? - Well, you gotta go back to the rubber boom. The rubber barons went down there and at the start of the industrial revolution, the only way to get rubber was to mine it from the trees that are out in the forest. And so the only way to do that, 'cause you can't make a rubber plantation in the jungle.",

One missionary said they were killing the locals the way you or I would kill a mosquito. They just went nuts. And so they sent them out and they would come back with rubber and this would go to fuel the industrial revolution for hoses and gaskets and tires and all this stuff that suddenly we needed. And it was during that time that these, you know, gangs of foreigners would go into the jungle to enslave the natives that these uncontacted tribes went back into the jungle and said, \"Not us.\" And they have six-foot bows and seven-foot arrows with bamboo tips. They make the bamboo tips into razor blades. And so when those things fly, actually one of my rangers, one of the Junglekeepers team was present when the tribes had come out onto the river, and he tried to help them 'cause they're nomadic and they live out there. And so there's an element of like brother, you know, they're trying to be like, you don't need to be like this, like, we're friendly. So they sent a canoe across the river with bananas. And so he's up to his waist in the river and the tribes are right across the river. And they shot, and he sees the arrow coming right at his head. And as he moved to the side, it hit him at the temple and sliced them back towards the ear, opening him to the skull, he's fine. But let me tell you something, when he goes and gets a crew cut, it's the most badass scar you've ever seen, man. And so he always keeps it real short on that side.

And so we just have to be respectful of like, you don't camp on certain beaches at certain times of the year because we know that they might be there. You really have to be careful about that. - Have you yourself interacted with any? - My interaction with them came on a solo where I pushed it a little bit too far. I was planning to do a three week, this was like the big one. I got dropped off by poachers up a river and I went past the point where they were like names there. I said what tributary are we on?

It's like, no, you're not. You're born into a room full of people usually, at the very least your mother's there for everybody. So you've been around people probably if you're a normal person every single day of your life, you've seen dozens if not hundreds of people. And all of a sudden you realize what a social creature we are, because on day six, it gets weird. For me, it got weird, I know there's people that can do it longer. - So what does that mean?

And then there came this panic of, what if it's gone? Or like, what if World War III broke out and I just don't know about it? My family in New York is vaporizing. Something. - So actually, your ability to comprehend and interpret reality kind of requires other people. It's not just that you're lonely, you need that contact to actually just perceive the world, makes sense of it, all of that, so you start basically hallucinating in a certain kind of way. - I started feeling very uncomfortable. And it doesn't help also that, like, Santiago told me these stories where he's like, \"If you hear capuchins sounding not quite monkeys, if you hear capuchin monkeys sounding not quite like capuchin,\" he goes, \"It's the tribe and they're coming to get ya.\" And then, so the guy who was shot, Ignacio, they showed me videos where we saw them on the beach and they're communicating in monkey calls. They're using it as code so that we don't understand them, even though we don't speak their language. But they're using animal calls.

And then one night, I messed up, and I left a fish. I cleaned this fish, I ate like this huge fish, I just ate it to my face.

There was 100,000 tigers in 1900, now there's 4,000 tigers left on earth. It's not rocket science.

They communicate love, maybe more simply, maybe more honestly. Anyway, so you were with the crocs and the fish. - Yeah. So I messed up, I left the fish out, crocs showed up outside my tent. But in the end it was fine. I backed off, they had their way with the fish, and then they all started biting each other, it was fun to watch. - Is that a general, sorry to interrupt, is that a general rule, you want to not leave food? - Yeah, just like if you're camping in the northeast, you don't leave like, you do a bear bag or a bear canister, you don't want to invite the wild animals. I really did mess up, I kind of was just like, you know, whatever, I do this every now and then, I get a little too cavalier, and the ocean has almost taken me down for that a few times. But yeah, so the crocs, and then you keep going for a few days. And my plan was to get to a point where I reached the end of the tributary. And this had a very... You know, again, for me, this is like a pilgrimage. This is like me going into the heart of the very center and soul and essence of everything that I am fascinated with, like, as close to God as you can get because you're leaving every type of security, every human relationship, you're also pushing all your chips in. Every step I took further upriver, it got weirder and weirder and more intense. And every day and every moment it changed. I brought pictures, and at the time, there's no way to keep a phone charged, I didn't have like a power bank or anything. You know, I brought pictures from home. I brought a National Geographic magazine, something just to, you know. And there came a day right when I was getting to the end, like to the point where the river was so shallow that it was just a trickle. And I was walking on the rocks and the Andes mountains were in front of me. And I was like reaching the place",

And so, I went. This is the other idiot thing. It's like, just turn around. Just do it. I'm that kid though when you see like a wet paint sign, like I walk by and I touch the wall. And so I went around the bend and I see a few naked people on the beach and they see me. And we're like a good distance apart, they're on the other side of the river. But, you know, arrow in hand, bow in hand. The intention of pose, they're looking at me, they're clearly conversing.

If you're alone with these people, it's not gonna go well, and I have nothing to defend myself with. And I turned and I ran for like three hours and I got in the river and I swam for a while. And all my food got wet, I mean everything. - [Lex] Just ran for dear life. - Just ran for dear life. And my get out plan, the thing after I crossed the mountains and came down into the next tributary was I had a pack raft. It's a tiny little inflatable raft, good enough to handle rapids. And I inflated the pack raft once the river was like six inches deep, I inflated the pack raft and I went. And I went for the rest of that day into the night, I went into the point that my headlamp died and I was just floating in a raft down the Amazon and hitting into things. And then I was like, okay, I'm gonna pop this raft. So I got out of the raft, set up my tent, and I was like, I need some sleep, I was freaking out.",

So I woke up, got back in the tent, and then at one point it was really cool 'cause one of the same black caiman that had come for the fish as I'm going downriver, he came right up next to me and the two of us were going and he was just like motoring downriver, this giant, like, 16-foot crocodile. He just came up to me and looked at me as I was going. And it was funny 'cause I wasn't scared of him, I was scared of them. And yeah, it took me like a week to get back to town.

Like, if you were forced to interact for a week together, where they can't, they're not allowed to kill you. - [Paul] Not allowed to kill me. - How fundamentally different are they, do you think? - I don't think they're different, I think they're like any other Amazonian natives. They're tall, they seem to have tall genetics. And there's places, you know, again, there's what is known and then there's what we know down there. Like, there's one community where, I don't know whether it was like a bad rainstorm or something, but some kid from the uncontacted tribes did end up in a village. And so he learned Spanish, or he learned whatever dialect they speak in that village. And so he's told us a little bit about what life was like with them. But like, they're just people. They're just people. They have their own culture, they know about medicines that we don't know about. They definitely have hunting practices",

And it's like, the truth is is that when it's dark out there, they can't see, it's not easy to start a fire with matches in a lighter and gasoline, they do it with friction. They have some beads on survival that we could really learn from.

On the point of uncontacted tribes, it's interesting to think about what kind of civilizations have there been? This is something that you've talked about a little bit. Graham Hancock has written about ancient civilizations and sort of challenging the conventionals or the mainstream thinking about the civilizations that have been there in the Amazon. Can you steelman and criticize the idea, so the pro and the con of the idea that there have been ancient, advanced ancient civilizations in the Amazon? Like, how much do we know? Or what are all the possibilities of what's in the Amazon in its past?",

And then, you know, a few hundred years later when people got to actually check up on this stuff, it was all gone. And so was that because of disease that we wiped out all these civilizations and these communities of people? Potentially, probably. Was he just wrong? Probably not. This is a guy that navigated by the stars back to Spain after building his own boat. Or did he, you know? Or was he trying to just, I don't know. I don't know. But there clearly is a long history of complex civilizations in the Amazon. A hundred percent, there's no one that can deny that. The thing that I reacted to was that I've heard videos, I've seen moments in podcasts where the narrative becomes not, there's more ancient civilization information in the Amazon than we previously thought, true statement. We're discovering with lidar, and this is what Graham Hancock is talking about, that we're discovering constantly that there is more civilizations than we thought in various places. The place where I take offense is where they start to say that the Amazon, there's actually articles that are titled this, that the Amazon is a manmade garden, which is not true. - So the actual, which I think is a really different idea that the entire ecosystem, everything we've been talking about, all the species, all the forestry and the different, just life, life, one of the most diverse ecosystems on earth is initially created by humans. - It's ridiculous. - Well, it's not. First of all, it's unlikely, but it's not ridiculous. So we can't, there's no ridiculous in science. - [Paul] No. - But the complexity of life is very difficult to engineer the more you study about biological systems and so on, it's very difficult to create the kind of things that nature is able to do. That said, I don't know if you've heard, but the entire earth, the world has gone through a pandemic recently.",

So humans are able to create stuff, at least modern technological genetic engineering. - We made golden retrievers. Come on. - You can't be that nice and that good looking. It used to be a wolf, yeah. So that bothers you because it allows you to think that we don't need to preserve the Amazon, we can always engineer it. - Yeah, exactly. This is just to me, that's a slippery slope. It's so quick from, I'm a fan of expeditions to find ecological ruins and to learn more about the ancient civilizations to, which I don't think is what he's putting out is that, then sort of like news articles, which I think they're trying to bait you, where they're going, was the Amazon manmade? And it's like, you know. Because then you get a Brazilian president that go, \"See? See what they said? It's manmade. So we might as well continue to engineer it and manage it.\" And it's like, there's such complex systems and interactions and such a giant web of life there that, at least in my opinion, is clearly one of the most authentically natural things. And again, are there things that we've engineered, the uncontacted tribes, sometimes they have banana plants that they've stolen and we could see it from the air that they have banana plants. We've made banana plants, that's engineered by us, we know for a fact. - [Lex] Agricultural engineering. - Agricultural engineering and stuff like that. But suggesting that the Amazon basin, you know, it's just a weird way to think about it. I've just heard people dismiss the protection of the Amazon based on the fact they're like, oh well, if people made it, and it's such a giant leap from zero to a hundred. Is there slash and burn that the ancient civilizations did? Of course. Are there areas that were affected by people? Of course.

I mean, like a hundred thousand years? - It could be less, it could be less. It could be like a few thousand because a hundred thousand is complete destruction. - [Paul] Hundred thousand is like nothing. - But then it could be in just a few hundred years, it starts becoming, the government of the alien civilization is gonna have to pay quite a bit of money to do the research to find, 'cause they're gonna find other life first. They're gonna find the dolphins and the fish and so on. They're gonna find the trees, maybe the trees are the interesting thing. The buildings are not that interesting without humans.

But most of the computer stuff, all the stuff of the past hundred years, the airplanes, all of that, all the technologies, all of the paperwork, all the hard drives that store all the information. - I want to actually know how long it takes like a 747 to biodegrade.

And I mean the stonework they did, much like what the Egyptians did with the pyramids, a lot of it we don't really understand how they did it.

There's certain biological stations, there's certain places where like, oh, this university has a relationship with this, this university with this. So everybody goes to the same few study sites, and then they walk on the same trails and they have the same guides. When you fly in a Cessna and you fly a few hours away from all that and you see a tiny little tributary, and then you fly for 40 minutes over unbroken green, just wild, before you reach another tributary.

And so there's so much undiscovered stuff in the Amazon that is just waiting, just waiting. - What is the process of exploring that? So how does money get converted towards exploration? Is there safe ways of doing that? - There's places where, you know, we've found out about things that have to be explored. You come up with, well how do we do this without getting shot. And not only without getting shot, but also without endangering them too, 'cause how stupid are we if we go in there to people that are living in the jungle, not bothering us, and we go insert ourselves into there because we're curious about some rocks.

'Cause once you get good enough at technology, you realize that happiness lies in a peaceful coexistence. It's possible. - So where do you stand on like aliens now? Like, there's a lot coming out about the pilots and the things people have been seeing. And again, I kind of come in and out of this stuff, like I'll be in the jungle for three months. I miss a lot, so like, update me. Are we being contacted right now? - Of course nobody knows, but I tend to believe. My intuition says there's aliens everywhere, even our galaxy. That's a bigger leap but I believe our galaxy has probably billions, hundreds of millions of planets with life on it, like bacteria type of life. And I believe there is, I don't know, thousands of intelligent alien civilizations that exist or have existed. The problem is there's a lot of time, and it's very difficult to contact each other. So to achieve a kind of civilization that's able to actually send out enough signal or radiate enough energy where we would notice, I think that's really tough. That said, statistically speaking, it seems like that should have been possible inside our galaxy or maybe nearby. And so, I suspect that once an alien civilization is just many orders of magnitude smarter than us humans, the way it would contact us is going to be very difficult for us humans to understand. We're very ego-centric. We want the message to be sent as like a, in English, versus, you know, I think consciousness itself, emotion, thoughts, could be like fingertips, could be words in the story that aliens are telling us, or things that are just like a low-dimensional projection of a much higher dimensional message that's being sent by aliens. And that maybe are striving to create technology is to create the kind of sensor that's actually able to hear some of the message,",

The aliens are here, we're just too dumb to see it. - So first of all, the imagining planets where there are, like, just picturing, not a silent planet, but just like a planet of alternate life forms. You know, maybe it's not something that we can communicate and have a conversation with, but just a planet of like butterflies and centipedes and weird, you know, things. - Unfortunately, bacterias, for billions of years, it was bacteria as single cell, prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but they're boring, but yeah. - Animals of some sort in an environment of some sort. Imagine that, it would just be such an interesting, beautiful, amazing thing, and I'm sure they're out. On that, I'm yeah. - The kind of viruses they got going on. But they could also not be biologically based, they could be different chemistry so you have to be humble to that too. - [Paul] Sure. - But then, you know, it depends on the day. Like, I think you caught me on that day today, an optimistic one. Sometimes I think we're all, this is all there is because you ask that question the fermi paradox, like, why aren't they here? You can't imagine an advancing civilization that would not be explorers, because we're explorers. - Why is that depressing to you? The idea that... Let's just say you found out right now that there isn't anything else. Let's just say that for example's sake that the earth is the earth and the universe is the universe, and it's sort of like the backdrop of a video game, and it's just what's out there.

So what if we do mess it up so bad that we can't live here anymore? - Well, there's different ways to mess it up. There's ways to mess it up to make life really difficult. - [Paul] You have \"Mad Max\" type of things. - But there's nuclear war with a further and further advancement of technology that can destroy all of our, it just feels like that's going to be exponentially growing. - [Paul] Yes, it's gonna get worse. - Listen, I'm very optimistic, but it's a heck of a Russian roulette we're playing. - Okay. But I'm still curious about your intention though, or like where your passion for this comes from. Or maybe it's both, but is it the need to have a backup plan for humans, which is admirable for your intense love of humanity and our consciousness and love and art and everything, or is it also just that the raw fascination of imagining what's out there?

I think I'm the kind of person that sees beauty in everything, but to me, a universe full of diverse life is more beautiful than one where it's just humans.

There's no communication coming from it, but we know for a fact there's stuff going on there. It would just change how we think about our entire reality.

I think I'm on mushrooms all the time, genetically somehow because when I go out in nature, it's just the beauty, even of nothing, you talk about the Amazon, man, just basics of nature fill me with awe. The other thing that fills me with awe is our own mind, like the biology of these things firing. Basically, not our own mind, but biology of any living organisms 'cause it's like an ecosystem. These cells came together, they somehow function, they delegate, they mostly operate in a local way. First of all, it's just like you said with the anacondas, you start out as a tiny snake and you become giant. When you're a tiny snake, you're prey for everything, when you're a giant snake, you're a predator, or you're prey to no one.

I mean, just to me, the idea of, I mean I have a little piece of meteorite at home that I hold.

In the next 10 years, we're gonna have to decide, are we gonna let our ocean ecosystems just collapse? Are we gonna just take that 3% of rainforest and just let them log the shit out of it until it's gone? And it's like, we're gonna be in a very different reality then, then it's gonna be very dystopian future. Or, can we keep the good things about earth, transcend that, realize that we have these incredible alien species around us that are animals that we grew up with, that we wouldn't be here without, that we owe something to.

Like, I think people realize that online interaction is shallow, but we're just learning that that's a reality, that we need that human connection. And I think there's going to be the swing back to like, sadly, AI systems of the future might be able to live fulfilling lives online, but us humans have to have a deep connection with earth and like with each other and physical connection. I think there's going to be a phase somewhere in the century where we go back to deep physical connection, and there'll be a digital world that we visit that will be separate. You have discussion with that, with Twitter, with Instagram, with all these social networks that they seem to be dividing us, they seem to not be bringing happiness.

So anything on legs, four legs or two legs.

Now, while I'm still, I grew up in the place with no internet in a time with no internet, so I still like biological dogs better.

Let me ask you about a touchy topic, climate change. What's the effect of climate change on the Amazon, maybe species diversity. What is something that people should think about? Because there's different views on, I think most people believe that climate change is human-caused and that it's happening, but there is different perspectives on the degree of damage that it's going to do over the next several decades and what our response should be as a society. And so it would be amazing to hear your perspective on it, in small slices of your experience or in large. - To me, there's no denying the fact that we are experiencing changes.

I can only provide anecdotal evidence of the stuff I've seen. What I do do though, and I always make a strong delineation here, is that I can speak to the fact that I've been places where the ocean fisheries have been depleted and the local fishermen can tell you, and the scientists can tell you there's no more fish here. I've been to the places where the rainforest line is being pushed back in Borneo and it's getting smaller and smaller and smaller. And I've been in the Amazon and I've walked through the killing fields and through the fires and I've burnt my lungs on it.

Therefore, as he would say, as people like Björn Loberg would say, the kind of fear mongering that is done saying we should spend humongous amounts of money to change the trajectory of everything we're doing in terms of energy, in terms of infrastructure and so on, in terms of how we allocate money is not justified because predicting is very difficult. And instead, it's better exactly what you're saying, which is focusing on local problem, (chuckles) local, saying we need to protect the Amazon. What are the things attacking the Amazon this year in the next five years? How can we stop the deforestation? How can we stop different things? And humans are exceptionally good at coming up with solutions for that, especially when you put money behind it, you put attention to it. And that's the way we solve all the different problems that are projected for the climate change in its worst case scenarios to be realized on this earth. So that's kind of the case he would make.

And I think that's probably the right lens through which to look at the effects of climate change in terms of focusing on the different things that are threatening the diversity of species in this most magical place on earth, which is the Amazon. But also, as you talk about with elephants and tigers in India, and focusing on how to solve those problems. I don't know if there's any comment you wanna make on folks like Jordan Peterson who are sort of raising questions about how much do we really understand about the climate. - First of all, I'm such a Jordan Peterson fan, and I think the guy is heroic for a number of reasons. And I find his use of language and his use of theology and the message that he puts out wonderful. I cringe a little bit when he says, I feel like, and I might not even be accurate on this, but I cringe a little bit when I feel like he dismisses that there is an ecological emergency happening right now.

And I kind of agree with him there because, so are you telling me that we need to halt our global process and progress and economies and everything? I don't know, I don't know. So to me, that doesn't bother me because he's exploring what the hell are these people talking about.

You have me roll into a village in the Amazon when they offer me spider monkey and you tell me that I should be a vegan, you see how much they respect you when you tell them that you're a vegan. But no. So for someone like Peterson, I think it's actually good that he's first of all telling everyone to make their damn beds, and exploring it through a different lens. He's coming at it from a totally different thing and saying, are we just being alarmist here? I mean, again, imagine if there isn't a problem and they're making one out of it and all the implications that that could have for progress. So I think what he's doing is perfectly reasonable. There is a podcast though where he's, it was a great one though, where he's discussing animal intelligence. And I could really see that the human psyche and theology and religion is so much his world that really the idea of animals being intelligent was novel, and it was fascinating. - Yeah, that's why I would love for the two of you to talk. I don't know, and hopefully I'm not outta line here, but he is so focused on the human mind that I think he forgets that there's other life out there. There's this whole machine of intelligence, of a kind of intelligence out there. This entire trillions of species, tiny and big, just everywhere, and we're actually part of it. So to look at it, human psychology is distinct from that is missing at least some of the picture. - Some of the picture. I do believe though I would agree with him on that humans are unique. Human psychology is unique, we just are. He's in such an interesting place because usually you have, you know, environmentalists who are like, you know, nature, nature, nature,",

Like, it is one thing to be an evolutionary biologist and kind of study it from a philosophical perspective and it's the other to really I think experience it and deeply know and to see, I don't know, the fact that we came from fish and really be cognizant of that. That's something else. That's like, I don't know, to realize that we're part of a computing machine that created intelligence.

And I think it's so easy for people to forget that we share this planet with so many other things. And I think that that sort of, in a way, we're almost like ecological orphans and that we've left the things that actually make us feel at home. And that's a bit of a stretch 'cause I don't know if everybody feels that way, but for me, I mean professionally as an expedition guide, when I take people into nature, I see what happens to them.

If we do that, if we journey together, where would you recommend we should go? - So what I would wanna show you is sort of, I'd want to take you to church, I'd want to take you to see the giant trees, take you to meet the old gods, really. There's places when you walk in off the river that are so deep in the forest, you know, and again, now we do this, we have the boats, we have the rangers, we protect this ecological corridor now. And so it would be taking you to meet some of those loggers that we converted. It'd be taking you, we'd have to go to the floating forest, meet some of the trees that I love the most, go piranha fishing. And like, really just spend, my ideal trip for you would be to spend five days of airplane-mode phone, completely living out comfortable. I'm not saying, I don't wanna torture you, I'm saying go and live comfortably on an expedition in the Amazon. And that means a few days at this research station, maybe go upriver three days and camp up here just on the edge of where the uncontacted are, and then come back and then see the Junglekeepers station.

It's wet. - It's not that bad. It is wet. The new iPhones are waterproof. And if they don't get, I'm telling you dude, it's been such a weapon, it's been awesome. If you drop it in the river, my one thing is you gotta have a tether 'cause I drop it all the time.

So you can keep the equipment dry. - I keep the equipment dry and I actually don't, a lot of people put their in silica at night and keep it dry and then they take it out. And I find that when you do that, the temperature change creates moisture inside the camera. So what I do is I never do that, I just keep my cameras in my backpack with a zipper so they're more or less exposed to the elements. And so it sort of always has a little bit of equilibrium, and that's it. I mean, I shoot on some pretty fancy equipment sometimes and it's great. But I mean the awesome thing though now is that like, with a cell phone, I mean like, I put my phone down on the ground a few weeks ago and let this rhino walk up to it and stuff.

It's getting really exciting, and that's where I deviate from the nature people that are like we need to go back and live in cabins. I'm like, dude, this is awesome.

I mean, I remember one of the most recent things that got people, you never know what's gonna get people excited. I literally just like, there was like 3000 butterflies on the beach and they were all like black, red, and blue, beautiful butterflies.

How do you notice the thing that's beautiful and say, I'm going to wait a minute, like pause, this is beautiful, let me take a picture of this, because like sometimes you might get used to the beauty, right? - Yeah. Or like sometimes simple crazy things like leafcutter ants, they're just walking by, it becomes pedestrian. It's like, well.

We're trying to watch 'Peaky Blinders' here. Just leave us alone.\" It becomes normal after a while. But no, in the jungle, that's never a struggle for me, because as a photographer, it's like whenever my eye hits on something I went, I've never seen that many of those butterflies all the same species together.

What I wanna do is get the shot where I, I guess leave the phone recording in slowmo facing up, and leave it there for an hour. Let the butterflies come in and settle and then disturb them so I get the bottom of the vortex of the bug.

And you just shove it full of equipment and who cares? - [Paul] Do the best you can. - You can go to war zone, it doesn't matter.

        "text": "What are they up to? What do they do? - Poachers to me are the people that are going in and annihilating wildlife for profit without any, you know, the people that are going in and machine-gunning an elephant to take its tusks. The people that are sneaking into protected areas in Africa and shooting rhinos so that they can cut off their horns before the animal's even dead while it's baby is beside it. And there's a difference between a poacher and a hunter. I'm a hunter, JJ's a hunter. I work with an organization called VETPAW in Africa, and they use United States veterans who have come back, post 9/11 veterans who have come back from the war and have these skills. And they've been using these guys to protect the last black rhinos, white rhinos, elephants. And so, I've gotten to see this play out on a private reserve in Africa where these incredible people have decided to protect zebra's, wildebeest, all types of impala, giraffes, several herds of elephants, white rhinos, black rhinos, all of this stuff is protected. And what's interesting is it's a hunting preserve. And so it's been very interesting and challenging sharing my work there with the public because, for instance, I went to a very high-profile photographer recently and I said, \"You have to get over here and see this.\" It's amazing what these people have done, it's this reserve called Buffalo Kloof. This rescued families of elephants and they have, you can see a black rhino every day if you want to. They're critically endangered. And it's because of the work that VETPAW does, protecting these animals from poachers. But what people don't understand is that hunting happens all the time on the reserve, not for the elephants and the rhinos, those are special and they will never be hunted there. But things like an impala, things like an inhala, a wildebeest, a zebra. There aren't as many predators as there used to be. So if you leave those animals unhunted, you know, without the wolf to chase the herd to thin off the ones that are old and dying or sick, well then you just have animals that are old and dying and sick walking around suffering. And so on reserves like this, they hunt, and they take the old ones, and they use the funding from hunting.",

And so these reserves responsibly and ethically on foot can go hunting and manage. And again, if they were hunting rhinos or if they were hunting elephants, I'd be out in a second. - They're hunting non-endangered species. - They're hunting non-endangered species, they're hunting game species. And the difference is that a poacher is gonna, and so those are responsible hunters that are ecologists and conservationists, whereas a poacher is someone that will come in and kill recklessly and murder an animal for no reason for a part to sell. - I would love to travel together actually. So we'll talk offline, I would love to make that happen, if you allow me. - I'm a hundred percent serious, man. I've tremendous respect for your work and I've been watching you since the beginning. I would love to do that together. - I've talked to Joe quite a bit about it, and I really love the idea of eating the meat that I've hunted. It's mostly what I eat is meat, not for dietary, I don't have any weird constraints on my diet and so on, I just really enjoy eating meat. - [Paul] It's really good. - And there is a part of me that's bothered by factory farming, that it's very easily-accessible meat but there's something deeply wrong with it. Part of the reason I love fishing and eating the fish that I catch, it just seems to be more ethical, but also a more intimate, deep connection, honest connection with nature. You get to see the killing of the food that you're consuming versus removing that from the picture, not even thinking about it, not thinking about that this came from the meat. I love the idea that I kill one animal and I eat that animal basically for the whole year. - Yeah.

And it's like, yeah. To me, yes, when you feel that fish tug on the line, to me it does something that awakens a deep primal something, this satisfaction. And then when you eat that you feel good. The other thing sort of functionally speaking is that, aside from the fact that I think it's one of the original, we are so disconnected, like we should be hunting. We should be gathering, walking more. I mean, look at what we discussed now, like people are like, oh, you gotta get your steps in for the day. And it's like, that never used to be a problem. You know, people are like, should we be eating animals? And it's like, what do you think we do here on earth? Like, I'm not sure how you got so confused, but Walmart did it to you.

So when I hear these frantic people talking about, you know, whether or not it's right, no, of course it is. Then again, factory farming is awful, but I try and walk the line. I'm worried about wild animals, I'm worried about wild ecosystems. The other thing that's sort of important about hunting is that if people's livelihoods depend on salmon and elk and ocean fisheries, well then they'll fight to protect it naturally because it's part of their life.

        "text": "Somehow you keep surviving. What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing? Why are we here? Like, do you ever ask yourself for that question? - I feel like that's every day. I feel like I'm someone that lives with that a lot. And I think that it actually takes me away from the human world a little bit. I feel like I've always been a little bit apart because I think that other people do, you know, mushrooms and they go, wow, it really made me think about how amazing it is here. And I feel like on a daily basis, I find myself where I'm like, I can't believe that any of this is possible. And that goes from how delicious something tastes to being able to talk to someone in your family, or have a phone. There's times where I'm in the Amazon and I miss home, and even just FaceTiming with someone, I go, this is possible? Like, people were rubbing sticks together to try and survive sabertooth tigers not that long ago and I'm over there like, \"Yo, mom, look at this.\" It's wild. Like, I'm in a constant state of awe. I actually hope that this is a testing ground. And whether it's aliens or God or whatever it is, that this is something crucially important. That would be nice, because it feels like it is. - Yeah, I hope that too, that the universe almost created us to see what's possible. And that I'd like to believe that beauty and good is possible. - And those are the things that make me say that it's not, it's impossible for it to just mean nothing. And just like you said, there could be life forms that we can't even understand. I'm very open to the idea that there's meanings that we have no idea about. The few things I know or the things that I love and some of the things that I love are being pushed to extinction so I try to protect them. That's my mission. But I'm saying like in terms of what are we doing here, I'm just always amazed at the simplest things, you know, that we can sit here doing this exchanging. - Using our imagination to fill in the gaps, exchanging feelings, experiences, images.",

        "text": "Yeah, it fills you with awe. And every once in a while you get a little glimpse of something, like a deeper meaning that might be there. And you don't really know what it is, but you get a glimpse and you keep searching. And then it's over before you know it, Paul. Hopefully for you, you got many more years. - [Paul] That's dark, man. - You're an important, important and a beautiful man. Paul, thank you so much for talking today. Thank you for being who you are, for everything you're doing. I hope to see you again soon, many times and maybe one day soon in the jungle. - I hope that happens. Thank you, Lex. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Paul Rosalie. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Jane Goodall. If we kill off the wild, then we're killing off a part of our souls. Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.",
