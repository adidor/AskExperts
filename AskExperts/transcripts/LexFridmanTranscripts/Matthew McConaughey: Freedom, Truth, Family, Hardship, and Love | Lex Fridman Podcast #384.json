        "text": "- If you really wanna give a character an obstacle to overcome, a need, I mean, the base one is life and death. - The following is a conversation with Matthew McConaughey, a legendary Oscar-winning actor, and one of the most unique, charismatic, and inspiring humans, and Texans who walked this Earth. He starred in films and shows loved by me and millions of others, including \"Interstellar\", \"Dazed and Confused\", \"Dallas Buyers Club\", \"Killer Joe\", \"Mud\", \"True Detective\", and soon, a spinoff of \"Yellowstone\". Offscreen, his words carry wisdom and power. In his book called \"Greenlights\" and his new video course called Roadtrip, where Matthew expands on the philosophy in his book and shows how to apply to your life in order to find more happiness, success, and love. This is Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Matthew McConaughey. Let's start with love. Your parents had a complicated love story, divorced twice, married three times. What have you learned about love from your mom and dad and their love story? - That it's messy. That it takes work. That it's ugly. That no matter how ugly or messy it is, don't go to bed until you've come back together to either embrace or admit that you truly love each other, even if you hadn't solved what the hell you're bitchin' about. Love will win in the end, literally, three to two, with my mom and dad. (Matthew and Lex laugh) - Yeah. - And that even in the two divorces and in the two times where they couldn't live with each other, they still loved each other. They just couldn't live with each other at that time. For whatever reason they needed, and I don't know the details, if they needed their space, freedom, or what,",

And that as a parent, when we're not sure what to do, and people give you a 1,000 books and advice, as a parent, if your kid knows you love 'em, you're in the black. That's the main thing. It won't work without that. And it can work and will usually can work with that. They just know that fact. - So it's not just love for each other, it's the love for the bigger family that ultimately helps you persist through the ups and downs. - Well, I mean, I don't know how much, particularly my mom and dad were staying together at times, maybe when they didn't want to because they had children. I don't actually think they considered that. I think they were much less conscientious than say I am today. I think my mom and dad were more like, they'll be fine. We love 'em. They'll be fine, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there. Right now, let's work it out between you and I is what I think my mom and dad were saying to each other, or not. They wanted and needed a relationship that was a tidal wave, rocky, right angles, tsunamis. And to this day, in my life with Camilla and I, which I don't, I like a river has some swerves and some streams and some rapids, but I'm not looking for a tidal wave. My mom's like, what's with all this, everything's so smooth. - [Lex] Yeah. - Stuff. Come on, come on, come on, come on. - [Lex] Yeah. - So she challenges vitality, 'cause that's what my mom needed to communicate. I don't think my dad needed it as much of that the hard angles that their relationship to, I don't think my dad needed it as much as my mom. - But the clashes demonstrated the passion that underlies the love. - Yes, and I've always been asked, when I talk about my parents' love relationship, I tell the stories that are actually sometimes",

Wait a minute, that was unhealthy. You can't, and I was like, no. That's, again, back to the beginning, love is messy. And what I love about those stories is that's where the love was actually. It was tested, and it could have broke and been over. - [Lex] Yeah. - And it never was. Again, the love won in the kitchen floor, blood's drawn, knives are pulled. - [Lex] Ketchup. - Ketchup's all over. - [Lex] Yeah. - But we make love on the kitchen floor and, I mean- - Yeah. - Come on, beautiful. - So as romantic as it gets right there. - [Matthew] Whoa! (Lex laughs) - What's the memory from childhood that helped set you on the trajectory of becoming the man you are today? - Standing on the corner with Mr. Mayor, the principal of St. Phillips School, I was in kindergarten, eh, looked up and there was a cloud in the sky. And I said, Mr. Mayor, is that cloud as big as the world? And he paused for a minute and he goes, \"Well, yes, it is, Matthew.\" Now, in my seven-year-old mind, I went, okay, I can see the outlines of it. And that must mean it is so far away. Because if that's as big as the world, I remember it took 15 hours just to drive from Longview to Florida last year, you know? And I can't even see that far. So that cloud must be so far off that it's not worth me even considering space, dreams, any of that. I was like, (whistling) army, I'm looking down. I'm gonna put my head to the ground. I'm gonna look right in front of me and deal with what's in front of me. Because dealing with dreams and what's out there",

So I think I learned a lot of self-reliance from that. I think I got a work ethic from that. I think I got a, hey, focus on what's right in front of you. Do the deed, take care of what's in front of you one at a time and slowly notch up your way. And, hopefully, there's some ascension to that. And it wasn't until quite years later, in some ways, decades later, that I started to go, \"Oh, I can project, I can dream.\" Why? Because literally the first time I got on a plane and then 30 seconds I was in a cloud, I'm like, Whoa, we must be going a trillion miles an hour. Cause we're already in that cloud that was as big as the world that I saw the edge of. And then I grew and learned enough to go, Well, that's not true. Planes don't go that fast. Oh, what Mr. Mayor said wasn't really true. That cloud is not as big as the world. And it's not near as far away as I thought. But I'm glad he lied to me. (chuckles) - What do you think about that tension of a way of living life between being a dreamer and a pragmatist? - [Matthew] Yeah. - Which is the better way? - Dude, the honey holds the reciprocity of the two of 'em. I mean, I can't be present unless I got a plan. I wanna have the big picture in mind, but I gotta go a day at a time. I like to write the headline or I think we need to have a North Star, something to look forward to. But we all know that if we're staring at it, we're tripping on the way. You read the Hallmark cards, which irk me, dream it, you can do it. I think that's a half-ass horrible thing to tell somebody.

And I think that constant tension, when that tension's a dance is when it's beautiful, But to see those as contradictions, I think is where it's falling short. One on their own, if we silo the two, well, if you silo the two, I guess the pragmatic's the one to go with, because at least you'll get something done. But if you only silo the dream and don't do anything about it, you're kind of living an illusion and kind of living in a virtual reality. - Yeah, it's tricky. Even the people you love can sometimes suffocate the dream, can make you believe that it's not possible. It feels like a lot of parents kinda want you to be safe, want you to be stable, want you to have a plan so that everything's gonna be okay. - [Matthew] Yeah. - And the dream feels like a threat to that. - Yeah. How much of that, though, I wonder is proper initiation? Because if you throwing dreams out, I call it conservative, very liberal light. Let's learn to block and tackle. Let's learn that work ethic, those things, those pragmatics first, learn the rules of the road, the rules of the game, the things that we can all kind of rely on. This is how the world's supposed to work. Now, it doesn't always work that way. You know, you teach a child to drive, it's like, \"Hey, you stay in the lane, you go to speed limit. This is all helpful.\" But that doesn't guarantee that no one else is running the red light. But you learn that later. There's an initiation, I think that's proper with the dream. I mean, I think parents, my parents are very much that way. The idea of going to chase an acting career or something was, what? That was a different vernacular.",

He said, \"Go!\" In between the lines, what he heard from me was that made him so happy as a father, I believe, and makes any parent happy, is when our child doesn't ask us permission to go chase a dream. - [Lex] Oh, yeah. - When they're going, I'm bringing it up to you with full respect. - [Lex] Yeah. - But I'm doing this with or without you.

For me, what that literally meant to me, when that came to me in a dream and I carved it in, I remember carved it in a tree. It took a couple hours. I still know where that tree is, Santa Monica. My father had moved on, he'd left this life. All of a sudden, it hit me, oh, I don't have the safety net. My dad was above law and above religion to me, he had me. If I really was in the shit, if I really needed him, I trusted that he had my back above law, above anything. All of a sudden he's gone. I'm going, okay. It hit me how much I'd been pretending to be the young man I was trying to be, and not actually putting my ass on the line and have enough courage to take risk and actually own up to the man that he was teaching me to be. And I remember the world got flat. That cloud, that Mr. Mayor that I saw up there was not way up there. It was, it was fog in front of me now, and let's go into it. I'd say I probably gained even more respect for people and things, but I lost a certain amount of reverence that was keeping me from feeling like I'd deserved or I'd earned things or looking out for myself or holding myself to task. And I remember all the things, and I was just going into Hollywood at the time, so fame was out there as one of those clouds, with being an actor and all of a sudden celebrity and becoming famous. The reverence I had, I remember it just (whistling) it lowered down to eye level. And I was able to realize it and go, that's not fairy dust. And don't give it so much credit to make it fairy dust. Like, oh, not me. No, I could never, no, look that in the eye with full respect, but less reverence. And at the same time, equidistant,",

I looked things in the eye. I became probably less sentimental, hopefully, not to level that I got callous, but I know I became less sentimental. I became more courageous because, when you have someone pass in your life, or maybe it's similar to a situation you're going on in your own life with your homeland, you sober up on these mendacities that we deal with every day, and this bullshit that we give too much credit or too much significance to. And you're like, what am I doing? I'm not even gonna let myself emotionally get brought down or over elated by this situation, 'cause it doesn't really matter in the big scheme.

Let's look it in the eye and go forward through it and deal with the consequences. - What do you make of death? Does it scare you? - I'm not looking forward to it, but it does not scare me. - Do you think about it? Do you visualize it? - I do. I do. And it's a beautiful visualization and a beautiful dream when I go as part of the food chain. It's not a good visualization when I go as part of a random act of violence in a fricking drive-by or something.

You return to nature. - Yeah, there's grace and poetry in that. - Do you miss your father? Think about him? - When I think about him, I do. Now, when do I think about him? I thought about him yesterday working through a script I'm working on right now, working on scene work. And I just had that quick little reaction of wanting to show him, hey, check the scene. That's right and then I, I don't get sad. I go, \"Yeah, he would've loved this.\" Whereas my mom wants to be on the stage, my dad would've been on the front row. (Matthew and Lex laughing) - He's more fun to show stuff too. - Yeah. He was a character. He knew characters. I've based parts of all kinds of characters I've played and the man that I am on people that he introduced me to and who he was. He would've loved the creative process of working on a script or talking about, hey, movie. It's why I always say I love the movie \"Mud\" because it's the one that I've visualized and seen my dad come to me so many times as a 12-year-old and put his arm around me and go, \"Hey, little buddy, you see this movie called 'Mud'? Goddamn it, it's a good one. Let's go watch it.\" That, now my dad never got to see me start a career in film, but he was alive five days, he overlapped the first five days of me working on my first film, \"Dazed and Confused\". Now, that I think is, there's something beautiful about that. He didn't never ever come to the set. We didn't talk about it, but he was alive for me to start something that was more than a fad.

And it was holding them from going where they wanted to in their future. And so I thought that was revealing. I would've thought that was, I don't know going in 40%.

I'm questioning, is there value to going, if you're not getting past this today, this week, this month, this year, all of a sudden a decade goes by, and you're still hung up and you can't get rid of that thing. And your memory where we, and it's got you paralyzed and you're a victim of it, and you're doing the therapy, and you're doing the work and you're taking a prescription if that's what you're taking, where does there, is there a value in going? If it's holding you back from going where you wanna go, maybe you should just deny the fucking thing ever fuckin' happened. - [Lex] Yeah. - Kick it in the head. - [Lex] Yeah. - Kick it off the curb. I'm done with you. I'm sick of you, I'm tired of hanging out with you. I'm tired of that thing, whatever it is, hold me back from going where I wanna go. So if I can't wax the car, you know, and get past this thing, just kick it. - That's so powerful. So one thing to do like with the loss of your father, is to try to transform it, to discover the gift in it. The gift and the pain. But if you can't keep looking, keep looking, you can't find the gift and the pain, just deny it ever happened. - You could call that a trick. But I think it's more than a trick because let me say this, my mom, after my father died, went on and found a second love of her life for 19 years, they were together. CJ Carlick. Love you, buddy. He's moved on now. Did she check with us a little bit? Like is this okay? She gave us a little lingering half a second look that we knew that maybe was what she was asking, and we came to her was like, yes, it's okay.",

No, but she didn't say, I'm not, well, what's the book on how long I'm supposed to say single before I can be interested in another? There's not a book on these things. How do you feel? Is loving CJ mean you love dad less? No. Is finding a new life and a new dance partner in this life, in CJ mean that Dad wasn't your dance partner, that dad wasn't the love of your life? No. So I don't know, I mean, in there maybe, maybe there's another word, I think it's denial, but it's not really denial 'cause it's not like it didn't happen. That's an earlier example I was giving my mom. She will absolutely go, that light's not on. Mom, the light's on.

I didn't, but she sure as hell turn the page, and said, I can still start a whole new category, a new life, a new love.

And that 90 seconds on that elevator, (claps) that's what got you that job that led to you doing what you wanna do. I mean, the significance is there, but we have to, I think what we also gotta watch is, again, in that balance, what do we chase? Because we just chased the engineering. We miss magic. If we just chased the mystical, we find ourself caught up in trying to give meaning to that Lego set that was on the floor that my kids didn't pick up. And what color was it? And why did I walk out that that door and see almost step on the Legos. But if I'd gone out the other door, I usually go out of, I would've gone there. I would've got there early and wouldn't have run into the boss. So you can start to give too much meaning on that as well. I think we can give significance in too many places.

I traveled last summer in Ukraine with no plan. I just went there. No plan. I didn't know how I'm going to meet the president of the country. I didn't know anybody.

Or I could see the science, saw the habits, here's what I did. yep, that add up, got the solution, got the conclusion. I was very surprised when I noticed it was probably less than 50%. And that most of the real success of life were when I trusted, when I trusted that I didn't have to define it. That I only trusted, that I didn't have to go, well what's the measurement?

Am I giving enough credit to these are the steps to take? And this is reality.

It's more like drinking a beer versus like doing homework. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's already happening. What do you think about that becoming the new family to where you said you're not married, you don't have kids. Could you see a future for yourself or do you have a relationship with AI and that is your family? - That's the main, that's the primary, like even romantic relationship. - [Matthew] Yeah. - I can see it, that one worries me. I like to keep it at friends. - Right. (Lex and Matthew laughs) - I think I'm not ready to commit to the romantic. (Matthew laughs) I wonder how much that now that takes us back to the Amazon in nature, how much we still need the human touch. - [Matthew] Yeah. - And whatever magic there is between two humans, which takes the leap into the romantic versus just the intimacy of a good friendship, I don't know. - So correct me if I'm wrong, you see AI as having a deep and meaningful friendship. - [Lex] Yeah. - And hopefully it will be a friend that will help you evolve and be able to love even more and be loved. And you can take that into humanity and find another homosapien? - [Lex] Yes. - To go, yes.

And we humans still play chess with each other. Chess is still a game that's fun for us humans. - [Matthew] Right. - And then we use AI systems to get better at chess, to learn, to train, to discover new ideas, but ultimately return to the chess board between two humans. But, of course, this world is full of dangerous people. And so those same AI systems can be used to harm, to create false narratives, to do social engineering and manipulate the masses in terms of what they believe and all that kind of stuff.

There's something, it's very simple, but I think it's a really done sort of way to just set up this reality and everyone, it's kind of a duh, but still needs to be said that AI is a prompt. It doesn't do anything unless we ask it. So what questions- - [Lex] Yeah. - Are we gonna ask is a question is what we need to ask ourselves 'cause we're going to be looking in the mirror at our digital God that we create from ourselves. And just to know that that's place where it's awesome and scary, exciting and scary. Where you go, oh, it's our creation, which is awesome at the same time. Oh, shit.

Basically, not letting the systems have an identity of their own. And some of it is just not engineered in yet.

And as you know, it wasn't a dance party up there in his mind, (chuckles) it was some some heavy stuff, but also existentially for him always like, death would be a deliverance for him. It'd also be a cop out in a way. It'd also would be, he was not a man who was gonna give himself amnesty and didn't allow it from the rest of the world. Wouldn't give himself an out and while living in his head and heart and spirit was whew, more of a hell than arguably dying. There was no alternative. That's not negotiable for that man. And that's why he was such a, that's why he was the best detective that ever walked the Earth. That's why he was such a superhero in a way to have that singular. You don't go, oh, I wish I was him. No, but you'd like, wow, that constitution, that clarity of identity. Talk about a measure in a man's constitution. He didn't allow anybody off the hook, especially himself. You wanted him to forgive a little bit or give himself a little amnesty. You wanted him to like, \"Man, it's Saturday bro, can you go on a date?\" (Lex laughs) You wanted him to like, enjoy something. But he was connected to something in his DNA, who he was and something much more baseline truth. And that's why he was such a good detective. So that, but there's an island, as much as that company can be. I said earlier on that Amazon trip, but it wouldn't join the company.

I didn't have as much patience for small talk. I wasn't tormented. - But the character was and you have to embody him. So is that, I mean, does some of that bleed over? Are you able to separate the man you are from the character? - Look, am I able to separate? Yeah, I came home to my kids and when they walk around the door and greet me and go, what'd you do today? And you got three kids under 10 years old, you don't tell 'em about the scene where you help someone commit suicide. (laughs) It's just, hey, you turn it into a parable.

What that dream did for me was allowed me to go, you may not find the woman for you and get married and have a life with her, that may not be. And for the first time in life I was okay with that. More than intellectually, spiritually, I was grounded. I was like, okay. Then I'm moving through the world. And on this particular night as myself, not intruding, I was inviting. I did see her move across the room and did not say, who is that? I said, what is that? (chuckles) (Lex laughs) And then did move to call her across the room. So I did invite, but I was not outside of myself and I was able to be myself with her, what my eyes saw, everything that she turned out to be when the lens got zoomed in more details got known. And we began to talk and got more intimate and closer together and spend more time, became true, and then some, but every single thing that I imagined when I saw her move across the room turned out to be true and then some. Just the image. We had similar moral bottom line about life, each other. How we treat ourselves, what we respect, what our own constitutions were. We had similar perspectives on raising children, which is very important to me and her. And then we just enjoyed each other's company. - [Lex] Yeah.",

Go, go, go again, take the next shot, more, more, more, more. This was a biggie too. - Getting excited for each other's success. - Yes. Yes. To be able, I think it's very important. We all have jealousy, I get it. But it's very important to be able, if you can be happy for your lover when they succeed or are succeeding or are across the room at the party, laughing with the stranger to be happy for them when it has nothing to do with you. I would be away, she would, the questions and the talks, we would have, she was happy for me about how excited I was about my day, and my day had nothing to do with her. - [Lex] Yeah. - She wasn't there. And I found myself not telling myself to be happy for her, but being really, really happy for her when she would tell me about something that happened that day with her. And as much as I went through my head, oh, I'd have been great if I would've been there. - [Lex] Yeah. - I was like, no, I don't only trespass on that. That you had that. - [Lex] Yeah. - Independent of me. Bravo. - That's a choice you make not to give any time to the jealousy, to the very natural jealousy that we humans have. - It sure doesn't happen any, I don't see the residuals in in it. - [Lex] (laughs) True. - I've got it. I've had it and I have it. I just don't, you know, I haven't seen where, it has any payback. - I gotta ask you the biggest possible question. What's the meaning of this whole thing? - Oh. - [Lex] What's the meaning of life? - Right. - (chuckles) Matthew McConaughey.",

        "text": "Why, why are we here? - I don't know why were here. I prescribed to, in a religious sense, the restoration order. We're here to restore order. In religious sense, I really, I purchased that and love that incentive and love that, that view, but I don't really know why we're here. But I do know to go back to the front, we are here. That part's inevitable. So now let's flip the script and go to the why not. Just keep living. What are we doing? The base of everything and we can argue not, the base of it. All I can come up with is well just keep living, man. I mean, what else are we supposed to do when we don't have any idea what to do? When we know exactly what we wanna do. Make it matter. Even when it doesn't matter, that matters. For what? I don't know. For the fun of it, that matters. - Yeah, our ability to create meaning and beauty in the mundane, in the absurd. It's kind of cool. - [Matthew] Yeah. - (laughs) And then we share it with each other. - [Matthew] Yeah. - We get excited. - [Matthew] Yeah. - And we create some pretty cool stuff along the way. - I mean, I say I'm confident enough, and I might be arrogant for me to say, but I do believe that we're here to each generation have a small ascension. - [Lex] Yeah. - Or else what's it for? (laughs) - And we're not really sure what the ascension is towards just kind of- - No. No, I just think it's up. Do you think it's up? I do think that it is definitely arrogant to think that we as a species or generation or people or humanity are going to reach the top of the ascended staircase and go, ta-da! (laughs)",

And I think it's this recipe for being, having more angst, and even cynicism we talked about and unrest and lack of seeing beauty and joy in this life while we're in it. I think life's a verb. Live it as best we can. Hopefully, I mean, I don't know. Sometimes I'm just, I don't have a grand plan. Man, I'm just trying to connect the dot. I'm confused, frustrated. I don't know what, I don't feel any gravity or building or lineage towards what I'm doing. And I'm just like going, what's that Peterson line? If you don't believe in heaven, do what you can to get as far away from hell as possible sometimes. (Lex laughs) - [Lex] Yeah. - It's a great line. Sometimes I'm just trying to like, man, just don't, don't sink the ship right now. Just keep your head above water. Maintain, just try and hold on. - And hopefully give yourself a chance to notice the magic, the mystical. I try to do that. - [Matthew] Yeah. - When it gets rough. - Because it's there. I do believe it's all around us all the time. - [Lex] Yeah. - Just are we on a frequency and do we allow ourselves to receive it and see it? - [Lex] We gotta tune the radio. - Yeah. Because we look for it too hard. We see false idols, and if we don't look at all, we become callous and miss it all. - Yeah. It's a fun little life we got. - [Matthew] Yeah. - Matthew, I'm a huge fan. I think you're an incredible person. Thank you for all the, everything you've created in this world. Thank you for being a unique human that inspires millions, and thank you for talking today.",
