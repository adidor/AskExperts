You have no choice. And I often felt I had to sacrifice things for the long term. And whether that would've been really difficult things like, you know, job changes, or reductions, or whether it would be things like, hey, we're gonna change the way we do our semiconductors. And a whole different philosophy. You have no choice. I mean- and in times of crisis as well, you gotta be, I always said it's not a popularity contest. - The following is a conversation with Ginni Rometty, who was a longtime CEO, President and Chairman of IBM. And for many years she was widely considered to be one of the most powerful women in the world. She's the author of a new book on power, leadership, and her life story called 'Good Power' coming out on March 7th. She is an incredible leader and human being, both fearless and compassionate. It was a huge honor and pleasure for me to sit down and have this chat with her. This is Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Ginni Rometty. You worked at IBM for over 40 years, starting as a systems engineer, and you ran the company as Chairman, President, CEO from 2011 to 2020. IBM is one of the largest tech companies in the world with, maybe you can correct me on this, with about 280,000 employees. What are the biggest challenges running the company of that size? Let's start with the, sort of, big overview question. - The biggest challenges I think are not in running 'em, it's in changing them. And that idea to know what you should change and what you should not change. Actually people don't always ask that question, what should endure, even if it has to be modernized, but what should endure? And then I found the hardest part was changing how work got done in such a big company.",

        "text": "- What was the parts that you thought should endure, the core of the company that was beautiful, and powerful and could persist through time, that it should persist through time? - I'd be interested, do you have a perception of what you think it would be? - Do I have a perception? Well, I'm a romantic for history of long running companies, so there's kind of a tradition as a AI person. To me, IBM has some epic sort of research accomplishments. Where you show off, you know, ID blue and Watson, just impressive big moonshot challenges, and accomplishing those. But that's I think, I guess, probably a small part what IBM is. That's mostly like the sexy public facing part. - Yeah, no, well certainly the research part itself, right, is over 3000. So it's not that small. That's a pretty big research part. - Yes, yes. - But the part that should endure ends up being, you know, company that does things that are essential to the world. Meaning, you know, think back, you said you're romantic. It was the thirties, the social security system. It was putting the man on the moon. It was, you know, to this day banks don't run, railroads don't run. That is at its core, it's doing mission critical work. And so that part I think is at its core, it's a business to business company. And at its core it's about doing things that are really important to the world, becoming, running and being better. - Running the infrastructure of the world. So doing it at scale, doing reliably. - Yes. Secure in this world, that's like everything. And in fact when I started, I almost felt people were looking for what that was. And together we sort of in a word was to be essential. And the reason I loved that word was, I can't call myself essential, you have to determine I am, right? So it was to be essential, even though some of what we did is exactly what you said is below the surface. So many people- 'cause people say to me, well what does IBM do now, right? And over the years it's changed so much. And today it's really a software and consulting company.",

        "text": "Consulting is a third of it. And the software is all hybrid cloud and AI. That would not have been true as you well know, back even two decades ago, right. So it changes. But I think its core, it's that be essential. You said moonshot, can't all be moonshots 'cause moonshots don't always work, but mission critical work. - So given the size though, when you started running it, did you feel the sort of thing that people usually associate with size, which is bureaucracy and maybe the aspect of, I'd say hinder progress or hinder pivoting. Did you feel that? - You would. For lots of reasons. I think when you're a big company, sometimes people think of processes the client themselves or, you know, I always say to people, your process is not your customer. There is a real customer here that you exist for. And that's really easy to fall into because they're, you know, people are a master to this process and that's not right. And when you're big, the other thing in- boy, there's a premium on it, is speed, right? That in our industry you gotta be fast. And go back, like when I took over and it was 2012, you know, we had a lot of catching up to do and a lot of things to do and it was moving so fast. And as you well know, all those trends were happening at once, which made 'em go even faster. And so pretty unprecedented actually for that many trends to be at one time. And I used to say to people, go faster, go faster, go faster. And honestly, I've tired 'em out. I mean, it kind of dawned on me that when you're that big, that's a really valuable lesson. And it taught me like the how's, perhaps more important than the what. Because if I didn't do something to change how work was done, like change those processes or, you know, give 'em new tools, help 'em with skills, they couldn't, they'll just like do the same thing faster. If someone tells you, you know, you've got hiking boots and they're like, no go run a marathon. You're like, I can't do it in those boots. But, so you've gotta do something.",

There's just, it's math. If there's less decision points, things go faster. You do the blunt club thing. And then after that though, it did lead me down a long journey of, they sound like buzzwords, but if you really do 'em at scale they're hard around things like agile. And because you've really gotta change the way work gets done. And we ended up training, God, hundreds of thousands of people on that stuff. - On how to do agile correctly? - On how to do it correctly. That's right. Versus- 'cause everybody talks about it. But the idea that you would really have small multi-disciplinary teams, work from the outside in, set those sort of interim steps, you know, take the feedback, pivot, and then do it on not just products, do it on lots of things. It's a hard to do at scale. People always say, oh I got this agile group over here of 40 people, but not when you're a couple hundred thousand people. You gotta get a lot of people to work that way. - The blunt club thing you're talking about. So flatten the organization as much as possible? - Yeah, yeah. I probably reduce the layers of management by half. And so that has lots of benefits, right? Time to a decision, more autonomy to people, and then the idea of like faster clarity of where you're going, 'cause you're not just filtered through so many different layers. And I think it's the kind of thing a lot of companies, if you're big, have to just keep going through. It's kinda like grass grows, you know, it just comes back and you gotta go back down and work on it. So it's a natural thing. But I hear so many people talk about it Lex, this idea of like, okay, well who makes a decision? You've often heard nobody can say yes",

And that's actually what you're trying to get out of a system like that. - So, I mean, your book in general, the way you lead is very much about we and us, you know, the the power of 'we'. But is there times when a leader has to step in and be almost autocratic, take control and make hard unpopular decisions? - Oh, I am sure you know the answer to that and it is of course yes. - It's just fun to hear you say. - It's fun to say it. Yeah. You know, 'cause I actually, A, there's a leader for a time, but then there's a leader for a situation, right? And so I've had to do plenty of unpopular things. I think anytime you have to run a company that endures a century and has to endure another century, you will do unpopular things, you have no choice.

I don't care if your company's got one person or half a million, they're not popularity contest. - But psychologically is it difficult to sort of step in as a new CEO and to- 'cause you're fighting against tradition, against all these people that act like experts of their thing, and they are experts of their thing, to step in and say we have to do it differently. - When you gotta change a company, it's really tempting to say, throw everything else out back to that what must endure, right? But, I know when I took over to start, I knew how much had to change. More I got into it, I could see, wow, a lot more had to change, right?

You will go back in time and you'll think of the mainframe systems, you'll think of the PC, you'll think of perhaps Middleware, you know, you could even call service as a platform. We needed the next platform here to be there. Skills, when I took over, we inventoried who had modern skills for the future, it was two out of 10 people, for the future. Not that they didn't have relevant skills today, but for the future, two out of 10. Yikes! That's a big problem, right? The speed at which things were getting done so you got so much to do and you say, is that a scary thing? Yes. Do you have to sometimes dictate? Yes. But I did find, and it is worth it. I know, every big company I know, my good friend that runs General Motors as she's had to change, go back to what is them them, you know? And when you do that, that back to be essential, we kind of started with, hey, it's be essential. Then the next thing I did with the team was say, okay, now this means new era of computing, new buyers are out there and, eh, we better have new skills. Okay, now the next thing, how do you operationalize it? And it just takes some time, but you can engineer that and get people to build belief. - And for the skills that means hiring and that means training? - Yes. Oh boy, that's a long- skills is a really long topic in and of itself, I try to put my view in it. I learned a lot and I changed my view on this a lot. I'll go back at my very beginning, say 40 years ago, I would've said at that point, okay, I was always in a hurry, I was interviewing to hire people. I don't know how you hire people. 40 years ago I'd be like, okay, I gotta fit in these interviews. I gotta hire someone to get this done. Okay.

Okay, hired a lot of experts over my life, and then I was really like an epiphany and it really happened over my tenure running the company and having to change skills. If someone's an expert at something and has just done that for 30 years, the odds of them really wanting to change a lot are pretty low. And when you're in a really dynamic industry, that's a problem. And so, okay, that was like kind of my first revelation on this. And then when I looked at hiring, I can remember when I started my job and we needed cyber people. And I go out there and I look, unemployment in the US was almost 10%, can't find them. Okay, it's 10% and I can't find the people. Okay, what's the issue? Okay, they're not teaching the right things. That led me down a path and it was serendipity that I happened to do a review of corporate social responsibility. We had this one little fledgling school in a low income area and, high school with a community college, we gave them internships, direction on curriculum. Lo and behold, we could hire these kids. I said, hmm, this is not CSR, like I just found a new talent pool. Which takes me to now what I'm doing in my post, you know, post-retirement. I'm like this idea that don't hire just for a college degree. We had 99% of our hires were college and PhDs, and I'm all for it. So you're very- don't, don't... - I'm deeply offended. - No, you should not be. And I'm vice chair at Northwestern, one of the vice chair. But I said, I just really like, aptitude does not equal access. These people didn't have access but they had aptitude. It changed my whole view to skills first.

        "text": "the number one thing I would hire for now is somebody's willingness to learn. You know, and you can test, you can try different ways, but their curiosity and willingness to learn, hands down I will take that trait over anything else they have. - So the interview process, the questions you asked. - [Ginni] Everything changed. - The kind of things you talk to them about is try to get at how curious they're about the work. - You can do testing. I mean, we triangulated run it lots of ways. And now look, at the heart of it, what it would do is change. You don't think of buying skills, you think of building skills. And when you think that way with so many people, and I think this country, many developed countries being disenfranchised, you gotta bring 'em back into the workforce somehow. And they gotta get some kind of contemporary skills. And if you took that approach, you can bring 'em back into the workforce. - Yeah, I think some interesting combination of humility and passion. 'Cause like you said, experts sometimes lack humility if they call themselves an expert for a few too many years. So you have to have that beginner's mind and a passion to be able to aggressively, constantly be a beginner at everything and learn, and learn, and learn. - You know, I saw it firsthand when we were beginning this path down the Cloud and AI, and we said, and people would say, oh, IBM, it's existential, they gotta change and all these things. And I did hire a lot of people from outside, very willing to learn new things, come on in, come on in. And I sometimes say shiny objects, trained and shiny objects, come on in. But I saw something, it was another one of these- You're not a shiny object, I'm not saying that. But I learned something. Okay, some of them did fantastic. And others, they're like, well let me school you on everything. But they didn't realize like, we did really mission critical work and they'd break a bank.

And then I watched IBM people say, oh, I actually could learn, some were like, yeah, okay, I don't know how to do, that's a really good thing I could learn. And in the end, there was not like one group as a winner and one was a loser, the winners were the people who were willing to learn from each other. I mean, to me it was very stark example of that point, and I saw it firsthand. So that's why I'm so committed to this idea about skills first and that's how people should be hired, promoted, paid, you name it. - Yeah, the AI in general, it seems like nobody really understands now what the future will look like. We're all trying to figure it out. So like what, you know, IBM will look like in 50 years in relation to the software business to AI is unknown, what Google will look like, what all these companies we're trying to figure it out, and that means constantly learning, taking risks, all of those things. And nobody's really skilled in AI. It's like, because you have to keep... - You're absolutely right. That's right. Couldn't agree more with you on that. - You wrote in the book. So speaking of hiring, \"My drive for perfection often meant I only focused on what needed to change without acknowledging the positive. This could keep people from trusting themselves. It could take me a while to learn that just because I could point something out didn't mean I should. I still spotted errors, but I became more deliberate about what I mentioned and sent back to get fixed. I also tried to curtail my tendency to micromanage and let people execute. I had to stop assuming my way was the best or only way. I was learning the giving other people control builds their confidence and that constantly trying to control people destroys it.\" So what's the right balance between showing the way and helping people find the way? - That is a good question.",

I mean, you've gotta let people find their way, 'cause it's so big you can't, right? That's an obvious answer. Scope of work, bigger it gets, okay, I've gotta let more stuff go. But I have always believed that a leader's job is to do as well. And I think there's like a few areas that are really important that you always do, now it doesn't meaning you're showing. So, like when it has to do with values and value-based decisions, like, I think it's really important to constantly show people that you walk your talk on that kind of thing is super important. And I actually think it's a struggle young companies have because those values aren't deeply rooted, and when the storm comes it's easy to uproot. And so I always felt like when it was that time I showed it, I got taught that so young at IBM and even General Motors that, in fact I do write about that in the book. First time I was a manager, I had a gentleman telling dirty jokes, and not to me but to other people, and it really offended people, some of the women. This is the very early eighties. And they came, said something, I talked to my boss, I'm a first time manager, and he was unequivocal with what I should do. He said, and this was a top performer, it stops immediately or you fire him. So there are a few areas like that that I actually think you have to always continue to role model and show, right? That to me isn't the kind that, like, when you let go of stuff, right? So... - The values and relationships with clients. - Yeah, whatever you're in service of. And the other thing was, I really felt it was really important to role model learning, right?

See 'cause I don't have to be doing all this stuff on the fly in my head, and I could actually take things I know and maybe help the situation.

Is there some aspect of hard work at the core of who you are that led to happiness for you? Did you enjoy it? - I enjoyed it.

Yeah. - For some stereotype or some view that it's somebody's abused it in some way. You can read the newspaper, somebody's doing something, personal people like, I'll ask people, do you want power?

So now you ask me about why do I work so hard. I ended up writing the book in three pieces for this reason. When you really think of your life in power, I thought it kind of felt like a pebble in water. Like, there's a ring about you really care about yourself and like the power of yourself, power of me, there's a time it transcends to that you are working within four others and in another moment when it becomes like about society. So my hard work, I'd ask you, one day sit really hard and think about, when you close your eyes who do you see from your early life, right? And what did you learn? And maybe it's not that hard for you. I mean it was- it's funny the things then, if I really looked at it, it's no surprise what I do today. And that hard work part, my great grandma, as you and I were comparing notes on Russia, right? And never spoke English, spoke Russian, came here to this country, was a cleaning person at the Wrigley building in Chicago. Yet if she hadn't saved every dime she made, my mother wouldn't have a home and wouldn't have had had car, right? What did I learn from that? Hard work. In fact, actually, when I went to college, she's like, you know you really should be on a farm. You're so big and strong, you know,? That was her view. And then my grandmother, another tragic life. What did she do though? And think how long, that's in the forties, the fifties, she made lampshades. And she taught me how to sew, right? So I could sew clothes when we couldn't afford 'em. But my memory of my grandma is working seven days a week, sewing lampshades, and then here comes my mom",

And I associate hard work with how you are sure you can always take care of yourself. And so I think that the roots go way back there and they were always teaching something, right? My great-grandma was teaching me how to cook, how to work a farm, even though I didn't need to be on a farm. My grandma taught me, you know, here's how to sew, here's how to run a business. And then my mother would teach us that, look with just a little bit of education, look at the difference it could make, right? So anyways, that's a long answer to, I think that hard work thing is really deeply rooted from that background. - And it gives you a way out from hard times. - Yeah. You know, I think I've seen you on other podcasts say, I thought I did, do you want a plan B? Didn't you say, no you would not like a plan B? - [Lex] Yeah. - 'Cause you're like, I would prefer my backup against, am I remembering? - A story like that. You seem to like at least certain moments in your life seem to do well in desperate times. - True enough, true enough, that's true. I learned that very well. But I also think that maybe this isn't the same kind of plan B. I think of it as like I was taught, like, always be able to take care of yourself, don't have to rely on someone else. And I think that to me, so that's my plan B I can take care of myself. And it's even after what I lived through with my father, I thought, well this set a bar for bad, after this nothing's bad. And it's a very freeing thought. - The being able to take care of yourself, is that, you mean practically or do you mean just a self-belief that I'll figure it out. - I'll figure it out and practically both, right. - So you wrote, \"I vividly remember the last two weeks of my freshman year when I only had 25 cents left.

This is it, I thought no more money.\" So do you think there's some aspect of that financial stress, even desperation, just being hungry, does that play a role in that drive that led to your success to be the CEO of one of the great companies ever? - It's a really interesting question because I was just talking to another colleague who's CEO of another great American company this weekend. And he mentioned to me about all this adversity and he said, or I said to him, I said, do you think part of your success is 'cause you had bad stuff happen? And he said yes, you know? And so, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say, I don't think you have to have tragedy, but it does teach you, like, one really important thing is that there is always a way forward, always, and it's in your control. - And I think there's probably wisdom for mentorship there or whether you're a parent or a mentor, that easy times don't result in growth. - Yeah, I've heard a lot of my friends and they worry, they some gee my kids have never had bad times. And so what happens here? So I don't know, is it required and why you end up, mm, not required, but it sure doesn't hurt. - You had this good line about a advice you were given that growth and comfort never coexist. Growth and comfort never coexist, and you have to get used to that thought. - If someone said that they think of me like one of the more profound little lessons I had.. - [Lex] It's pretty profound. - It's from my husband, and which is even more, you know, funny. - I'm glad you're able to- you could just steal it. I mean you don't have to give him credit. - Oh I have shamelessly, as he'll tell you. Okay, so the story behind growth and comfort never coexist. But honestly I think it's been a really freeing thought for me and it's helped me immensely since mid-career. And as I write about it in the book, I'm mid-career, and I've been running a pretty big business actually.

He looked at me, he says, well I think you should go to the interview. I went to the interview the next day, blah blah blah. Guy says to me, looks at me and he says, I wanna offer you that job. And I said, I would like to think about it. I said, I wanna go home and talk to my husband about it. He kind of looked at me, okay. I went home, my husband is sitting there and he says to me, I went on and on about the story, et cetera. And he says, do you think a man would've answered it that way? And I said, hmm. He says, I know you, he's like, six months you're gonna be bored, and you all you can think of is what you don't know. And he said, and I know these other people, you have way more skill than them and they think they could do it. And he's like, why? And for me it internalizes feeling that, I am gonna say something it's a bit stereotype, that it resonates with many, many women. And I'll ask you if it does after, is that either of them was most harsh critic of themselves. And so this idea that I won't grow unless I can feel uncomfortable, doesn't mean I always have to show it, by the way. So that's why I meant growth and comfort can never coexist. So I was like, he's exactly right. Now the end of that story is I went in and I took the job, when I went back to the man who was really my mentor looking out for me, and he looked at me and he said, don't ever do that again. And I said, I understand. Because it was okay to be uncomfortable, I didn't have to use that.

But then you means you're learning something, right? - [Lex] Holding it together. - So, that to me matters. - I think it's interesting the, maybe you could speak to that, the sort of the self-critical thing inside your brain. 'Cause I think sometimes it's talked about that women have that, but I have that definitely. And I think that's not just solely property of women at workplace. But I also wanna sort of push back on the idea that that's a bad thing that you should silence. 'Cause I think that anxiety that leads to growth also, that's like this discomfort. So there's this weird balance you have to have between that self-critical engine and confidence. - Yeah, I think that's a good point. - You have to kind of dance, 'cause if you're super confident people will value you higher, that's important. But if you're way too confident, maybe in the short term you'll gain, but in the long term you won't grow. - Very good point. So I can't really disagree with that. And to me, even when I took on jobs, I always felt people say, well is it, you know, what point are you confident enough? And I came to sort of believe, again a theme of my beliefs that if I was willing to ask lots of questions and understood enough, that's all I needed to know. - Let me ask you about your husband a little bit. (both laughing) So you're write in the book, you're write in the book. It's just jumping around, like I said, I'm a bit of a romantic. So how did you meet your husband? - So I met my husband when I was 19 years old. So I was a young kid. And I met him when I had a General Motor scholarship. So I was at Northwestern University through my first two years, had a lot of loans, financial aid, and a professor said, hey, you should sign up for this interview.

They will pay your tuition, your room and board, your expenses, Northwestern, other Ivy League school, these very expensive schools. And I think you'd be a good fit. I am eternally thankful for that advice. I went, I interviewed, I actually got the scholarship. I mean, without it I'd graduated with hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt. So part of that was in the summer, I had to work in Detroit. I lived in little room by a cement plant, not theirs, but I mean that's all I could afford. - [Lex] Very romantic. - Very, very romantic. And the person who owned the house said, you know, \"Hey, I'm having a party, you're not invited. I'm going to fix you up with someone tonight.\" And that turned out to be my husband. And so it was a blind date is how we very first met. - And then it was over. The story was written. - [Ginni] Yep. - Let's, if it's okay, just zoom out to, you mentioned power and good power a few times. So if we can just even talk about it. Your book is called 'Good Power: Leading Positive Change in Our Lives, Work and World.\" What is good power? What's the essence of good power? - So the essence of it would be doing something hard or meaningful, but in a positive way. I would also tell you, I hope one day I'm remembered for how I did things, not just for what I did. I think that could almost be more important. And I think it's a choice we can all make. So the essence to me of good power, if I had a contrast, good to bad let's say, would be that first off you have to embrace and navigate tension. This is the world we live in. And by embracing tension, not running from it, you would bridge divides that unites people not divides them. It's a hard thing to do but you can do it. You do it with respect, which is the opposite of fear. A lot of people think way to get things done is fear. And then the third thing would be you gotta celebrate some progress versus perfection. Because I also think that's what stops a lot of things from happening, because, you know, if you go for whatever your definition",

If I keep taking a step forward of progress, really tough stuff can get done. And so my view of that is like, honestly, I hope it can, you know, I said it's like a memoir with purpose, I'm only doing, it was a really hard thing for me to do 'cause I don't actually talk about all these things and I had to, nobody cares about your, like, scientific description of this. They want the stories in your life to bring it alive. So it's a memoir with purpose and in the writing of it, it became the power of me, the power of 'we', and the power of us. The idea that you build a foundation when you're young, mostly from my work life, the power of 'we', which says I kind of in retrospect could see five principles on how to really drive change that would be done in a good way. And then eventually you could scale that the power really of us, which is what I'm doing about finding better jobs for more people now that I co this, co-chair an organization called OneTen. So that essence of navigate tensions, do it respectfully, celebrate progress. And indulge me one more minute. These sort of, again, it's retrospect that- I didn't know this in the moment. I had to learn it, I learned it, I am blessed by a lot of the people I worked with and around. But some of the principles, like the first one says, if you're gonna do something, change something, do something, you gotta be in service of something. Being in service of is really different than serving, super different. And like I just had my knee replaced, and I interviewed all these doctors. You can tell the difference that the guy was gonna do a surgery, hey, my surgery's fine, I really don't care whether you can walk and do the stuff you wanted to do again, 'cause my surgery's fine, your hardware's good. I actually had some trouble and I had a doctor who was like,",

There's a big difference in those two things, and it's true in any business you have, a waiter serves you food, okay, he serves his food, he did his job, or did he care he had a good time? So that thought to be in service of it took me a while to get that, like, to try to write it, to get that across, 'cause I think it's like so fundamental. If people were really in service of something, you gotta believe that if I fulfill your needs, at the end of the day mine will be fulfilled. And that is that essence that makes it so different. And then the second part, second principle is about building belief, which is, I gotta hope you'll voluntarily believe in a new future or in some alternate reality, and you will use your discretionary energy versus me ordering you. You'll get so much more done, than the third change and endure, we kind of talked about that earlier. Focus more on the how and the skills, and then the part on good tech and being resilient. So anyways, I just felt that like Goodtech, everybody's a tech company, I don't care what you do today. And there's some fundamental things you gotta do. In fact pick up today's any newspaper, right? Chat GPT, you're an AI guy, all right? I believe one of the tenants of good tech is it's like responsibility for the long term. It says, so if you're gonna invent something, you better look at its upside and it's downside. Like we did quantum computing, great, lot of great stuff, right? Materials development, risk management calculations, endless list one day. On the other side it can break encryption, that's a bad thing. So we work equally hard on all the algorithms that would sustain quantum. I think with Chat, okay, great, there's equal and there are people working on it, but like, okay, the things that say, hey, I can tell this was written with that, right? Because the implications on how people learn, right? This is not a great thing if all it does is do your homework,",

But anyways, you get my point, it's just the upside and the downside. - And that there could be a much larger implications that are much more difficult to predict than it's our responsibility... - [Ginni] Absolutely. - To really work hard to figure that out. - Yeah, I was talking AI ethics a decade ago and I'm like, why won't anybody listen to us, you know? And that's another one of those values things that you realize, hey, if I'm gonna bring technology in the world, I better bring it safely, right? And that to me comes with, when you're an older company that's been around, you realize that society gave you a license to operate and it can take it away. And we see that happen to companies, and therefore you're like, okay, like why I feel so strong about skills. Hey, if I'm gonna bring in it's gonna create all these new jobs, job dislocation, then I should help, I'm trying to help people get new skills. Anyways, that's a long answer to what good tech, but the idea that there's kind of in retrospect a set of principles you could look at and maybe learn something from my sort of rocky road through there. - But it started with the power of 'we'. And there's that big leap I think that propagates to the things you're saying, which is the leap from focusing on yourself to the focusing on others. So that having that empathy, you've said, \"At some point in our lives and careers, our attention turns from ourselves to others. We still have our own goals, but we recognize that our actions affect many, that it is impossible to achieve anything truly meaningful alone.\" So it's to you, I think maybe you can correct me, but ultimate good power is about collaboration and maybe in, you know, in a large conference like delegation on great teams. - The ultimate good power is actually doing something for society. That would be my ultimate definition of good power.",

And so, you know, when you said a leap, do you think people make a leap when they go from thinking about themselves to others? Do you think it's a leap or do you think it kind of just is a sort of slow point? - I think the leap is in deciding that this is, it's like deciding that you will care about others. That this is, it's like a leap of going to the gym for the first time. It's yes, it takes a long time to develop that and to actually care, but the decision that I'm going to actually care about other human beings, yeah. I think, or at least like, yeah, it just feels like a deliberate action you take of empathy. - Yeah, 'cause sometimes I think it happens a little, it's maybe not as deliberate. Yeah, it is a little bit more gradual because it might happen because you realize that, geez, I can't get this done alone, so I gotta have other people with me. Well, how do I get them to help me do something? So I think it does happen a little bit more gradually, and as you get more confident, you start to not think so much that it's about you, and you start to think about this other thing you're trying to accomplish. And so that's why I felt it was a little more gradual. I also felt like, I can remember so well, you know, this idea that, again, now we're in the eighties, nineties, I'm a woman, I'm in technology, and I was down in Australia at a conference and I gave this great speech, again me, power of me, you know, I'm thinking I give this great speech, financial services, this man walks up to me after I think he's gonna, like, ask me some great question. And he said to me, I wish my daughter could have been here. And in that moment, and at that point, up to that night, I had always been about, look, please don't notice I'm a woman, do not notice that. I am, I just wanna be recognized for my work. Crossing over from me to we, like it or not, I was a role model for some number of people, and maybe I didn't wanna be, but that didn't really matter. So I could either accept that and embrace it or not. I think it's a good example of that transition.",

Okay, I am in these positions, I have a responsibility too and it's to others.

And as you mentioned the word power, you know the old saying goes, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Was there an aspect of power that was, that you had to resist its ability to corrupt your mind to sort of delude you into thinking you're smarter than you are? That kind of- all the ways that... - That's very dangerous. I agree with- I mean, I think you gotta be careful who you surround yourself with. That's how I would answer that question, right? And people who will hold the mirror up to you can be done in a very positive way, by the way, doesn't mean, you know? But that word 'sick of fans', you cannot have that, right?

I mean, do you authentically believe that diversity's a good thing? - Yeah, but I believe that diversity, like broadly... - [Ginni] A thought, I very broadly define it. - Yeah, so like there's, you know, sometimes the way diversity is looked at with the way diversity is used today is like surface level characteristics, which are also important, but they're usually reflective of something else, which is a diversity of background, a diversity of thought, a diversity of struggle. Some people that who grew up middle class versus poor, different countries, different motivations, all of that.

Were there times when there was pressure to sacrifice what is good for the world, for the bottom line in order to do... - Yeah there were probably, there were a lot of times for that. I mean, I think every company faces that today, and that always felt like there's so much discussion about stakeholder capitalism, right? Do you just serve a shareholder? Do you have multiple? I have always found, and I've been very vocal about that topic that- and I participated the business round table, wrote up a new purpose statement that had multiple stakeholders.

And so when I came on, we were still manufacturing R&D and manufacturing our own chips. We were losing a lot of money. Yet here we had to fight a war on Cloud and AI. And so, okay, now shareholders would say, fine, shut it down. Okay, those chips also powered some of the most important systems that power the banks of today. If I just shut it down, well, what would that do? And so, okay, the answer wasn't just stop it, the answer wasn't just keep putting money into it, the answer wasn't- we had to kind of sit in an uncomfortable spot till we found a way. I mean, it's gonna sound so basic, but you as an engineer understand it. We had to separate it, it was a very integrated process of research development and manufacturing. And you'd be perfecting things in manufacturing, and these were very high performance chips. We had to be able to separate those. We eventually found a way to do that so that we could take the manufacturing elsewhere and we would maintain the R&D. I think it's a great example of the question you just asked. Because, people would've applauded, others would've been, this was horrible. Or we'd had a financial roadmap that had been put in place that said, I'll make this amount of EPS by this date. There came a time we couldn't honor it because we had to invest. And there's a million of these decisions, I think most people that run firms, any size firm, they're just one right after another like that. And you're always making that short and long tension of what am I giving up? - Well, what is that partnership like with the clients? 'Cause you work with gigantic businesses. And what's it like, sort of, really forming a great relationship with them, understanding what their needs are being in service of their needs. - In service of, yeah. Very simple.

And so I can remember during one of the times I was on a European trip, and at the time lot of- and this is still true about views about technology, and national technology giants, and global ones, and the pros and the cons. And countries want their own national champions, quite obvious, I mean, if I'm France or Germany. And there was a lot of discussion about security and data, and who was getting access to what. And I can remember being in one of the, I was with Chancellor Merkel, had met her many times. Very well prepared, very well prepared every time, you would know. And I started to explain all these things about why, how, you know, how we don't share data, who it belongs to, our systems never had back doors. And she sort of stopped me, like, you're one of the good guys, like, stop. Now, that wasn't about me personally. She's talking about a company that's acted consistent with values for decades, right? So to me, how you work with those big kind of clients is you honor your promises. You say what you do and you do what you say. And you act with values over a long period of time. And that to me, people say about value, it is not a fluffy thing, it is not a fluffy thing. It is a- I mean, if I was starting a company now, I'd spend a lot of time on that. You know, why we do what we do and why some things are tolerable and something- you know, what's your fundamental beliefs are? And, and many people sort of zoom past that stage, right? It's okay for a while until... - And never sacrifice that. - You would never sacrifice that. I don't think you can. - So there was a lot of pressure when you took over as CEO, and there was 22 consecutive quarters of revenue decline between 2012 and the summer of 2017.

Were the decisions, the tensions in terms of investing versus making a profit? - I always felt that, that sense of urgency was so high. And even if I was calm on the outside. Because you have one of the world's largest pensions. So, so many people depend on you. You have a huge workforce, they're depending on you. You have clients whose businesses don't run if you don't perform, et cetera. And shareholders of course, right? And so, but I also am really clear, this was perhaps the largest reinvention IBM ever had to undertake, at a board that understood that. In fact, some of the headlines were like, this is existential, right? I mean, nobody gives you a right to exist forever. And there aren't many texts. You're the student of it, they are gone, they are all gone. And so if we didn't reinvent ourselves, we were gonna be extinct. And so now, but you're big and it's like changing, what's that old saying? Can I change the wheels while the train's running or something like that? Or the engines while the plane's flying. - [Lex] Yeah, exactly. - And that's what you have to do, and that took time. And so, you know, Lex, do I wish it would've been faster? Absolutely. But the team worked so hard, and in that timeframe 50% of the portfolio was changed. It's a very large company. And, if you would, I also divested $10 billion of businesses. So if you would look at that growth rate without divestitures and currency, which now today everyone talks about currency, back then we were the only international guy, net of divestitures and currency, the growth was flat. Is flat great? No. But flat for a big transformation? I was really proud of the team for what they did. That is actually pretty miraculous to have made it through that. I had my little nephew one day and he would see on TV, occasionally when there would be criticism and he'd say, you know, auntie does that make you mad when they talk mean?

And my successor, they have picked up, gone forward. I mean, you go back, we did the acquisition of Red Hat. I mean, we had to find our way on Cloud, right? We were late to it. So we had to find our way, and eventually that led us to hybrid cloud. We had did a lot of work with Red Hat back in 2017. Oh, we'd always done a lot of work with them. We actually were one of the first investors when they were first formed. But that was 2018, you know, it took quite a hit for even, oh, it was the largest to then software acquisition ever. But it is the foundation, right? Of what is our hybrid cloud play today and doing very, very well. So, but I had to take a short term hit for that, right? Short-term hit for a very large $34 billion acquisition. But it was, for all of us it was the right thing to do.

And one piece was spun off into a company called Kyndryl, which is managed outsourcing. Keeping things running, and they're off creating their own company. What IBM then retained is really the part I built with PWCC, the big consulting arm. And so today the IBM of today in 2023 is, you know, at least ending 2022 was 30% consulting, and the other 70% would be what would you consider software cloud AI. So hybrid cloud and AI is the other- and some hardware, obviously, still the mainframe is modernized, alive, and kicking, and still running some of the most important things of every bank you can think of practically in the world. And so that is the IBM of today versus perhaps, you know, and Red Hat is a big piece and an important part of that software portfolio. And they had some services with them for implementation, but it wasn't a very large part. And it's grown by leaps and bounds. You know, 'cause originally the belief was everything was gonna go to the public cloud. And at least many people thought that way. We didn't, and in fact, I mean we tried, we cured a public cloud company, we really tried to work it. But what we found was a lot of the mission critical work, it was tuned for consumer world, it wasn't tuned for the enterprise. So then time is elapsing here though, and you gotta be at scale. And we didn't have any application- remember we're not an application company. So it wasn't like we had an office, we didn't have anything that like pulled things out to the cloud.

And then they'll be public clouds, and you're gonna have to connect them and be secure. And that's what took us down the path with Red Hat, that belief. - The structure of that is fundamentally different than something that's consumer facing. So the lesson you learn there is you can't just reuse something that's optimized for consumers. - Yeah, very interesting point. It doesn't mean consumer companies can't move up into the enterprise 'cause obviously they have, right? But I think it's very hard to take something from the enterprise and come on down. And 'cause it gotta be simple, consumable, all the things we talked about already. - Plus you have to have the relationships with enterprise, they have to build to that. - Yeah, very different. Yeah. I mean, you know our history, right? At one time we had the PC business and the short answer to why would we would not do that is it's a consumer facing business, we were good at the enterprise. And that consumer business, a highly competitive, gotta be low cost, all the things that are not the same muscles necessarily of being in an innovation driven, you know, technology business. - Yeah, but what is now Lenovo, I guess, that's what's... - [Ginni] That's right Lenovo acquired it. - You were extremely good at that. So, but not as good as you're saying is that at an enterprise. Or it was... - Lenovo's very good at their PC world. Yes. And they can sell into the enterprise, right?

But it's back to knowing who you are is how I would sum that up as, right? And we were never great at making a lot of money at that. And you can remember originally was IBM PC, then the IBM clones. They weren't called IBM clones back then, as the field became highly, highly competitive. And as things commoditized, we often, as they commoditize, we would move them out, and move on to the next innovation level. - But because of that, it's not as public facing, even though that's one of the recognized logos ever. - Yeah. Isn't it true? That is very true. That is actually a very important point. And that is, you know, branding, as you say one of the most recognizable and a very highly ranked brand strength around the world. And so that's a trade off. I mean I can't, you know, 'cause there was a time you'd have something of IBM in your home, or a cash register as an example. You'd walk into a store, actually they're still in places, that went to Toshiba. - Can you speak to consulting a little bit? What does that entail to train up to hire a workforce that can be of service to all kinds of different problems in the software space, in the tech space? What's entailed in that? - I mean, you have to value a different set of things, right? And so you've gotta always stay ahead. It's about hiring people who are willing to learn. It is about, at the same time in my view, it's what really drives you to be customer centric. - And maybe you can educate me. I think consulting is a kind of, you roll in and you try to solve problems that businesses have, like with expertise, right? - [Ginni] Okay. - Is that the process of consulting. - Somewhat? Right?

So yeah, we could give your recommendations, and then we'd implement 'em and see 'em through because we had the technology to go to the implementation and see 'em through. And at the time back then, that's what, you know, there'd been five of those that had failed. The companies had bought other consulting firms. And, so we were- Okay, that was the great thing about, I mean, the harrowing thing about it was, here, please go work on this. None of the others have ever succeeded before. And yet on the other hand, the great promise was you could really, clients were dying at that time when we were doing that, to get more value outta their technology and have it really change the way the business worked. So I think of it as how to improve business and apply technology and see it all the way through. That's what we do today still. - Yeah, they see it all the way through. Yes. So let me say, almost like a personal question. So that was a big thing you were a part of that you led in 2002 that you championed and helped, I should say, negotiate the purchase of Monday the consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers for $3.5 billion. So what were some of the challenges of that that you remember? Personal and business. - At that time Pw really had to divest. And so they were in parallel going to IPO, right? So we sort of swept in at that point and said, and we'd been thinking about it a long time, and started to work on that as an acquisition.

You have the challenge of when you acquire something like that, as I say, you acquire hearts, not parts. They could leave. I mean, you could destroy your value by them leaving, they can walk right out the door. I mean, yes you can put lots of restraints but still that you had there.

It'd be things like clients would say, oh, IBM cares about a quarter, so let's negotiate every quarter on these prices. And, you know, when they were private they didn't have these issues.

That's being a generalization 'cause there people can learn all different ways, right? So I've done things like with my whole team, they all had to learn how to build cloud applications and called it code off. And so, I don't care what your job is, write code, you know? And I remember when we were trying to get the company to understand AI, we did something called a Cognitive Jam. Okay, there's a reason we picked the word cognitive by the way, instead of AI, today we used the word AI. It was really symbolic. It was to mean, this is to help you think, not replace your thinking. There was so much in the zeitgeist about AI being a bad thing at that time. So that was why we picked a mouthful of a word like cognitive. And it was like, no, no, this is to help you actually. So, you know, do what you do better or do something you haven't yet learned. And we did something called the Cognitive Jam. But the whole point was everybody in the company could volunteer, get on a team. You either had to build something that improved to one of our products, or did something for a client, or did a social issue with AI. And again, this goes back now, hmm, 10 years. And people did things from bullying applications to, you know, railroad stuff to whatever it was, but it got like a hundred thousand people to understand you know, viscerally what is AI. So that's a long answer to my belief around experiential.",

And not be afraid of. - Yeah. Like we mentioned at the beginning, IBM research has helped catalyze some of the biggest accomplishments in computing and artificial intelligence history. So Deep Blue, IBM Deep Blue versus Kasparov chess match in 96 and 97. Just to ask, kind of like, what your perception is, what your memory is of it, what is that moment? Like, this seminal moment? I believe probably one of the greatest moments in AI history when the machine first beat a human at a thing that humans. - You make a very interesting point 'cause it is like one of the first demonstrations of using a game to like bring something to people's consciousness, right? And to this date, people use games, right, to demonstrate different things. But at the time, it's funny, I didn't necessarily think of it so much as AI and I'll tell you why. I was, and I'm not a chess player, you might be a chess player, so I'm not expert at it, but I think I understand properly of chess that chess has got a finite number of moves it can be made. Therefore, if it's finite, really what's a demonstration of a supercomputing, right? It's about the amount of time and how fast it can crunch through to find the right move. So in some ways I thought of it as a almost a bigger demonstration of that, but it is absolutely, as you said, it is was a motivator one of the big milestones of AI because it put in your consciousness that it's man in this other machine, right, doing something. - So you saw it as just a challenging competition problem,",

I mean intelligence, that you can't build a machine that can beat a chess champion in chess and the fact that did... - I was blessed by not being a chess expert, so it wasn't.. - [Lex] So it's just a computation problem, I like it. - Computation problem to me. - Well that's probably required to not be paralyzed by the intensity of the task, so that this is just solvable. But it was a very, I think that was a powerful moment. So speaking just as an AI person, that reinvigorated the dream. - You were a little kid back then though, right, at that in 95. You had to be like, were you- you remember it actually at the moment? - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - Do you? - Yeah, yeah. - What did you think at the moment about it? - It was all inspiring because, especially sort of growing up in the Soviet Union, you think especially of Garry Kasparov and chess, like your intuition is weak about those things. I didn't see it as computation. I thought of it as intelligence, because chess for a human being doesn't feel like computation. It feels like some complicated relationship between memory, and patterns, and intuition, and guts, and instinct, and all of those, like some... - [Ginni] If you watch someone play that's what you would conclude, right? - And so to see a machine be able to beat a human, I mean you get a little bit of that with Chat GPT now. It's like language was taught us humans, the thing that we kind of surely, the poetry of language is something only humans can really have. It's going to be very difficult to replicate the magic of a natural language without deeply understanding language. But it seems like Chat GPT can do some incredible things in language.",

So that was truly inspiring that maybe intelligence, maybe the human mind is just algorithms. That was the thought at the time. And of course now, the funny thing what happens is the moment you accomplish it, everyone says, oh, it's just brute force algorithms, it's silly. And this continuous, every single time you pass a benchmark, a threshold to win a game, people say, oh well... - [Ginni] It's just this. - It's just this, it's just this. And that, I think that's funny, and there's going to be a moment when we're going to have to contend with AI systems that exhibit human-like emotions and feelings. And you have to start to have some difficult discussions about, well how do we treat those beings and what role do they have in society? What are the rules around that, you know? And this is really exciting because that also puts a mirror to ourselves to see, okay, what's the right way to treat each other as human beings? 'Cause it's a good test for that. - It is, 'cause I always say it's a reflection of humanity. I mean it's taught by what man, you know, bad stuff in the past, you'll teach bad stuff for the future. And which is why I think, you know, like efforts to regulate it are a fool's errand. You need to regulate uses not, you know, because it's not the technology itself is not inherently good or bad, but how it's used or taught can be good or bad for sure, right? And so that's to me will unveil now a whole different way of having to look at technology. - What about another magical leap with the early days of Watson with beating the Jeopardy challenge?

Yes, those are challenges, but the challenges are the people challenges around this, right? So do people trust it? How will they use it? I mean I saw that straight with doctors and like, meaning they're so busy in the way they've been taught to do something. Do they really have time to learn another way?

So very different thinking. So a lot of things to learn. We were making a market at the time, and when you make a market, you know, choice of problem you work on gets to be very important. When you're catching up, well then it's a scale game. So very different thing. But Watson proved, I think, I mean I hope I'm not being too, I think Watson brought AI back out of winner for the world. And that since then there's just been, you know, one company after another, and innovations, and people working on it. And I have no regrets of anything that we did, we learned so much. I mean we probably rebuilt it many times over and made it more modular. And today to IBM, a Watson is more about AI inside of a lot of things, if you think of it that way, which is more like an ingredient versus it's a thing in and of itself. And I think that's how it'll bring its real value. You know, more as an ingredient. And it's so badly needed, and even back then the issue was so much data, like what do you ever do it? You can't get through it, you can't use it for anything. You know this, well, it's your profession. So we have to have it.

And we even years ago saw this with the French banks, very unionized, but that idea that you could, in this case the unions voted for it, because it felt people did a better job. And that's just part about being really dedicated to help it help humanity not destroy it. - Speaking of which, a funny side note. So Kubrick's 2001 Space Odyssey, what do you think about, you know, the fact that HAL 9,000 was named after IBM? - I really don't think it was. I know there's- I really don't. - It could be more fake news. - It's more fake news. I have done, I've like researched this, tried to find any evidence and people have talked to, you know, was it really one letter, it was one letter... - One letter off. - [Ginni] Off, right? - But people that know H is one letter off of I, A is one letter off of B, and then L is one letter off of M. - I think that's a solution found afterwards, you know? - [Lex] Yeah, that's hilarious. - But here's what I think it more was, I do think it's one of the early demonstrations of evil AI. Like can be taught bad. - I could push back on that because it's presented as evil in the movie because it hurts, the AI hurts people. But it's a really interesting ethical question because the role of HAL 9,000 is to carry out a successful mission. And so the question that is a human question, it's not an AI question, at what price you humans wage war. They pay very heavy costs for a vision, for a goal of a future that creates a better world.

Depending your culture and everything else, with what you are doing and what you're gonna do. How do you think about it? Do you think about the AI you're going to develop as having guardrails dictated by some of your beliefs or? - Yeah, for sure. So there's so many interesting ways to do this the right way and I don't think anyone has an answer. I tend to believe that transparency is really important. So I think some aspect of your work should be open sourced, or at least have an open source competitor that creates a kind of forcing function for transparency of how you do things. So the other is, I tend to believe maybe it's because of the podcast and I've just talked to a lot of people, you should know the people involved. - [Ginni] I agree a hundred percent. - As opposed to hide behind a company wall. Sometimes there's a pressure, you have a PR team, and you have to care for investors and discussions, so on, let's protect, let's surely not tweet, not let's- like, and you form this bubble where you have incredible engineers doing fascinating work and also doing work that's difficult, complex human questions being answered. And we don't know about any of them as a society. And so we can't really have that conversation. Even though that conversation would be great for hiring, it would be great for revealing the complexities of what the company is facing. So when the company makes mistakes, you understand that it wasn't malevolence or half acidness. and the decision making is just a really hard problem. And so I think transparency is just good for everybody.

And then obviously the tools that run companies on which we depend, the infrastructure in which we depend, we need to know all about those AI decisions. And it's not as simple as, well, we don't want the AI to say these specific set of bad things. It's unfortunately, I don't believe it's possible to... - [Ginni] It's not. - Prevent evil or bad things by creating a set of cold mathematical rules. Unfortunately it's all fuzzy and gray areas, it's all a giant mess. - It is. I mean, you think about it like a knife. A knife can do good and a knife knife can do bad, okay? You can't- it's very hard. - [Lex] You can't ban knives. - You can't ban knives. And that this is, I think back it was 520, I dunno, 15, 16, we did principles of trust and transparency. Notice the word transparency. That belief that with AI it should be explainable, you should know who taught it, you should know the data that went into training it, you should know how it was written, if it's being used, you have a right to know these things.

That's my impression. - By the way, can I just comment on the fact that you keep asking me really hard questions, and I really appreciate your (speaking faintly) I'm really honored by it. As a fan of podcast myself, what I hope is to talk to people like you and to show that you are a fascinating and beautiful human being outside of your actual accomplishments also. So sometimes people are very focused on, you know, very specific things about, like you said, science, like what the actual work is, whether it's nuclear fusion or it's Chat GPT. I just wanna show that it's because I see it at MIT and everywhere, it's just human beings trying their best, they're flawed. But just realizing that all of these very well accomplished people are all the same. - Yeah, that's a very good- well said. - And then, so then regular people and the young people that they're able to see, you know, I can do this too,",

        "text": "I can have a very big impact. Yeah, exactly. It's like we're all kind of imposters. We're all like trying to figure out this. - [Ginni] To a certain degree. - So let me just ask you about family. You wrote that my family still jokes that the reason I never had children on my own was because I had already raised my family. They're right. So this is talking to you upbringing. But in general, what was your, you know, leading a giant company, what was the right place to find work-life balance for you to have time for family? Have time for away from work and be successful. - So I had to learn that. And I might've said, you know, you're the only one that can determine your own work life balance. Companies are innate things, I mean, they will take everything they can from you and it's not a bad thing. They just will as will bosses. I mean, you give it, we'll take it. And when people ask for, you know, I need roof. I'm like, okay, I had to come with terms with, the criminal was me. If I needed that balance, I had to set those boundaries. And so when I comment about a family, because I am in extreme awe of people with children who work. It is a extremely hard thing to do. I watch my siblings, I love my nieces and nephews. And whew, you know, A the emotional, their pain is your pain every minute of a day, and then you still have a job on top of it. And so when my mom had to go back to school and had to work, I was the one. And so when she couldn't go to the teacher meeting, I went to the teacher meeting. And so in some ways, and there's an age gap between my brother and I, and my other two sisters. And so I'm still, they they still call me mama bear even. I mean, I'm extremely protective of all of them, and it is as if I had raised them. And my mom did a great job raising 'em, I didn't, but I was there. And so when it came time to have children, and my husband came from a family where his father died",

        "text": "and was raised by a single mother. Very similar endpoint, different reasons why he ended up, you know, his father did not abandoned them. And I don't want people to believe to do my job, you can have no children. That is not right. I know other great women CEOs, Marillyn Hewson, who ran Lockheed Martin, extremely technical company. Mary Barra, who runs General Motors, Ellen Kullman who run DuPont, these are all my friends to this day. And they've been fantastic mothers and husbands good parents, right? And so I talk about it 'cause it was a choice we made. And so, you know, we both felt, look, we'd reached a point where for his reasons, what he had to do, I'd already felt that way. And that we were comfortable just being great aunts and uncles. And I'm a great aunt, you know. Well, I like to think that for my little guys, they're older now, but lots of 'em. And there's no doubt though the choices we made, Mark and I, that that made it easier for me to focus on work. I mean that's just math. You know, when you've got less people to have to take care of. And so I'm very considerate of that, and I think much of it informed many of the policies I put into because I had such great empathy for those who then still had these other responsibilities. And I desperately wanted them all to stay in the workforce. So I can remember and my siblings have been more successful than I by the way, I mean to my mother's credit. And my one sister who, you know, went to Northwestern, has an MBA, built some of the most sophisticated systems. She spent her whole career at Accenture and just recently retired as a chief executive of ALL Consulting. But at one point she took off time to spend with her family and then went go back to work. She's talking to me and she's like, hmm, I don't know if I should go back to work. You know, maybe life's path, you know, technology goes so fast, it's been a few years. I'm sitting there like, what are you talking about? I'm like, you know,",

        "text": "look at her credentials if far outstanding. I'm like, and I thought to myself like, ding, one of those moments, if my own sister feels that way with all her credentials, I'll bet I went back to work the next day and I said, hey, pull for me all the people who've left for parental reasons and or whatever family reasons and didn't come back. And it began a program of returnships. And I can't tell you how many, men and women, was because they didn't feel confident to come back. They thought technology passed them by. Okay, we said it's three months, you could stay one month, three months, doesn't matter. Well a lot of people, like one day they're like, you're right, not that much happened. I mean, well it happened, but I caught up, I actually know more than I think, you know? So it was a long answer to your question about I didn't, but I am so empathetic, and I am in awe of what they are able to do. And it made me then I think more empathetic to the policies and the like around that topic so you could keep great people in the workforce. - So you mentioned you're friends with Mary Barra, the CEO of GM. - [Ginni] I didn't mean to name drop, so don't... - No, I love her. She's amazing. So I just wanted to, I'm just curious. - I'll tell Mary she should do your podcast. - We'll make it happen. - She's a great leader. I always, I tell Mary what I think of hers, I think she's one of the more authentic leaders out there. Most authentic. - I mean it's just very different companies, huge challenges. - I worked there first I remember, right? So I'm very, in some ways I'm very beholden, right? You know, I'm very appreciative of what they did. I mean Mary and I are circa the same, well I'm a bit older, but circa that genre. - Do you exchange wisdom's? - Oh yeah. Yeah. When you do anything hard, it takes time and perseverance like we talked about. And you can get that, where do you get the fuel for it. You can either get it from your attitude or you can get it from your network or your relationships. And I'm a firm believer relationships",

If you focus on how can I bring Lex value, there'll be a day I need Lex and he will be back. And so to those women, to me relationships are not transactional. And it's a proof that to this day, even though I'm no longer still active as a CEO, these are still my friends, and they're- we are friends all of us. And I can remember some of them when I first became a CEO calling me and saying, hey, it's a little lonely here, so let me talk to you. And then when they became, I did the same for them and then they remember, and they do it for the next generation. And so it's a very supportive almost to a T any of the women you could name who have been CEOs, I would say almost to a T have all been very supportive. In fact, a number of us work on a little, another non-for-profit right now called Journey, which some women who had started the Fortune's Most Powerful Women had started, which was, could we get more women, particularly diverse women, but women in general to more quickly be into positions of leadership and power. And so many of the women you named and more, you know, we all dedicate time mentoring in kind of creating this little group of fellows every year to do this. - Friendship and love is core to this whole thing. Not just the success but just to the whole human condition. Let me ask one last question. Advice for young people. You've had a difficult upbringing, a difficult life, and you've become one of the most successful human beings in history. What advice would you give to young people or just people in general who are struggling a bit, trying to figure out how they can have a career they can be proud of, or maybe a life they can be proud of? - I feel like a life you can be proud of is just one if you leave something a little bit better. It doesn't have to be big, you know, that's a life well lived, right? It was Churchill who said, we may- it was how you might remember it better than I, you make a living by what you get and you live a life by what you give.",

        "text": "Something to that effect. But my advice would probably, when I'm asked this, I would tell them to ask more questions and give answers. Just focus on being a sponge. And it's funny, I asked my husband the same question the other day. I said, hey, what- we were talking to somebody and people were asking this and he sort of paused for a while and he said, I'd tell 'em patience. I said, what do you mean? And he said, I see so many young people, like they're in such a hurry to somewhere I don't know where. And that if they just had patience and let life unfold, I think that may be a surprise where they ended up. And actually I think that's a really good answer, to be honest. - Along the way keep asking questions, keep that childlike curiosity. - I know it sounds so easy to say, it's just so you know. - Yeah, like you said, the obvious things, I think they tend to to be the most profound. Ginni, you're an incredible human being, you're an inspiration is so many. Thank you for helping run and contribute to one of the great companies that brings so much good power to the world. And thank you for putting in the hard work of putting it all in the great book, so. And thank you for talking today. This was a huge honor, thank you for doing it. - You did a lovely job. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ginni Rometty.
