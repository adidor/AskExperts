Lee recently understand this podcast and he's he's a reminder to me that the physics community has like so many interesting characters yeah it's fascinating yeah anyway so so me as an experimentalist I tend to sort of think these are interesting ideas but they're not really testable so I tend not to think about very much so I mean going back to the science of this there wasn't that there is an explanation there was a possible solution to this problem of the Higgs which doesn't involve multiverses or creators fiddling about with the laws of physics if the most popular solution was",
