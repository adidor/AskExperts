        "text": "don't feel that space has to have an arrow right you could live in dynamic equilibrium there be no arrow of time but there'd still be time there's still be a difference between now and the future whatever also okay so if nothing changes there's still time well things could even change like if the whole universe consisted of the earth going around the Sun yeah okay it would just go in circles or ellipses right that's not every things would change but it's not increasing entropy there's no arrow if you took a movie event and I played you the movie backward you would never know so the arrow of time can theoretically point in the other direction for brief briefly so intent that it points in different directions it's not a very good arrow I mean the arrow of time in the macroscopic world is so powerful that there's just no chance of going back when you get down to tiny systems with only three or four moving parts then entropy can fluctuate up and down you",
