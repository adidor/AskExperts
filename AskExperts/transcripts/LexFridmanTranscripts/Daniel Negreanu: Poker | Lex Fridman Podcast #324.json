I get it I get the I get the the point of it all but like it literally has no effect on your life whatsoever your life is unchanged whether it's 31 or 33. yeah that's that's the negative of a lot of money is if it corrupts the way you see the world you start to be protective and so on I mean part of the challenge of when you get a lot of money is people start to treat you differently and so navigating that correctly is is very challenging so don't change let's keep remain the same person you always were because if you change you start to I mean that's why power corrupts is you get a lot of power you get a lot of Fame you get a lot of money",
