        "text": "other copy is having more or less fun yeah well the downside of many worlds is that you're missing out on an enormous and that's always what it's gonna be like and I mean there's a certain stage of acceptance and that yes in terms of rewinding do you think we can why in the system back sort of the the nice thing about many-worlds I guess is it really emphasizes the maybe you can correct me but to determine it the deterministic nature of a branch and it feels like it could be a while back is it is do you see is this something that can be perfectly one that rewinded back yeah you know if you're at a fancy French restaurant yeah there's a nice linen white tablecloth and you have your glass of Bordeaux and you knock it over and the wine spills across the tablecloth if the world were classical okay it would be possible that if you just lifted the wine glass up you'd be lucky enough that every molecule of wine would hop back into the glass right but guess what it's not going to happen in the real world and the quantum wave function is exactly the same way it is possible in principle to rewind everything if you start from perfect knowledge of the entire wave function of the universe in practice that's never gonna happen so time travel not possible nope at least quantum mechanics has no help what about memory does the universe have a memory of itself or we could in in so not time travel but peek back in time and do a little like replay well it's exactly the same in quantum mechanics as classical mechanics so whatever you want to say about that you know the fundamental laws of physics in either many worlds quantum mechanics or Newtonian physics conserve information so if you have all the information about the quantum state of the world right now your Laplace's demon-like and your knowledge and calculational capacity you",
