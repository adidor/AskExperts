        "text": "one what i'm doing now six miles each day then week two is seven miles week three is eight miles week four is nine miles so we're about four and a half weeks off from the challenge i think two or three days before the challenge i'll take complete rest days so my recommendation to you for what it's worth is to pick a cardio exercise that you can stick to on a daily basis so running cycling swimming even walking and just build the habit and do an intensity and duration that doesn't break your body down but it's still challenging just keeps challenging you but not too much not causing injury not causing over exertion over exhaustion on the bodyweight exercise side for me that's six days of exercise that includes push-ups pull-ups bodyweight squats and these ab roller things for the abs for the core i do it in rounds of 20 push-ups 10 pull-ups 10 ab rollers and 10 squats my recommendation again take it with a grain of salt is if you do body weight exercises pick numbers within the round that allows you to do timed rounds without much rest in between maybe no more than one minute's rest and do essentially a full body workout but not to exhaustion and i know a lot of people are going to say you know rest days are really essential you want to alternate upper body lower body push-pull all those kinds of things all of that is true when you're trying to achieve maximum performance what i find for me in a busy life when i have a million things going on building the habit building the ritual",
