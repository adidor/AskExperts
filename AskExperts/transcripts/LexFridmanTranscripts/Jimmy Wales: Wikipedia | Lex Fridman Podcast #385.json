We understand that we're hardcore, and actually there is a bit of nuance about how different companies respond to this, but our response has always been just to say no. And if they threaten to block, well knock yourself out. You'll lose Wikipedia. - The following is a conversation with Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, one of, if not the most impactful websites ever, expanding the collective knowledge, intelligence, and wisdom of human civilization. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Jimmy Wales. Let's start at the beginning. What is the origin story of Wikipedia? - The origin story of Wikipedia? Well, so I was watching the growth of the free software movement, open source software, and seeing programmers coming together to collaborate in new ways, sharing code, doing that under free license, which is really interesting because it empowers an ability to work together. That's really hard to do if the code is still proprietary, because then if I chip in and help, we sort of have to figure out how I'm gonna be rewarded and what that is. But the idea that everyone can copy it and it just is part of the commons, really empowered a huge wave of creative software production. And I realized that that kind of collaboration could extend beyond just software to all kinds of cultural works. And the first thing that I thought of was an encyclopedia. And I thought, oh, that seems obvious that an encyclopedia, you can collaborate on it. There's a few reasons why. One, we all pretty much know what an encyclopedia entry on, say the Eiffel Tower, should be like. You know, you should see a picture, a few pictures maybe, history, location, something about the architect, et cetera, et cetera. So we have a shared understanding of what it is we're trying to do, and then we can collaborate and different people can chip in",

        "text": "and find sources and so on and so forth. So, set up first Nupedia, which was about two years before Wikipedia. And with Nupedia, we had this idea that in order to be respected, we had to be even more academic than a traditional encyclopedia, because a bunch of volunteers on the internet getting out to (indistinct) write an encyclopedia, you know, you could be made fun of if it's just every random person. So we had implemented this seven stage review process to get anything published. And two things came of that. So one thing, one of the earliest entries that we published after this rigorous process, a few days later, we had to pull it because as soon as it hit the web and the broader community took a look at it, people noticed plagiarism and realized that it wasn't actually that good, even though it had been reviewed by academics and so on. So we had to pull it. So it's like, oh, okay, well, so much for a seven stage review process. But also, I decided that I wanted to try- I was frustrated, and why is this taking so long? Why is it so hard? So I thought, oh, okay. I saw that Robert Merton had won Nobel Prize in economics for his work on option pricing theory. And when I was in academia, that's what I worked on, was option pricing theory, I had a published paper. So I'd worked through all of his academic papers and I knew his work quite well. I thought, oh, I'll just, I'll write a short biography of Merton. And when I started to do it, I'd been out of academia. I hadn't been a grad student for a few years then. I felt this huge intimidation because they were gonna take my draft and send it to the most prestigious finance professors that we could find to give me feedback for revisions. And it felt like being back in grad school. You know, it's like this really oppressive sort of like, you're gonna submit it for a review and you're gonna get critiques. - A little bit of the bad part of grad school. - Yeah, yeah, the bad part of grad school, right? And so I was like, oh, this isn't intellectually fun. This is like the bad part of grad school.",

And so that was when I realized, okay, look, this is never gonna work. This is not something that people are really gonna want to do. So Jeremy Rosenfeld, one of my employees, had brought and showed me the Wiki concept in December, and then Larry Sanger brought in the same, said, what about this Wiki idea? And so in January we decided to launch Wikipedia, but we weren't sure. So the original project was called Nupedia. And even though it wasn't successful, we did have quite a group of academics and like really serious people. And we were concerned that, oh, maybe these academics are gonna really hate this idea and we shouldn't just convert the project immediately. We should launch this as a side project. The idea of here's a wiki where we can start playing around. But actually we got more work done in two weeks than we had in almost two years, because people were able to just jump on and start doing stuff. And it was actually a very exciting time. You know, you could, back then, you could be the first person who typed Africa is a continent and hit save, you know, which isn't much of an encyclopedia entry, but it's true. And it's a start and it's kind of fun. Like I, you know, you put your name down. Actually, a funny story was several years later, I just happened to be online and I saw when, I think his name is Robert Alman, won the Nobel Prize in economics. And we didn't have an entry on him at all, which was surprising, but it wasn't that surprising. This was still early days, you know? And so I got to be the first person to type Robert Alman won Nobel Prize in economics and hit save, which again, wasn't a very good article. But then I came back two days later and people had improved it and so forth. So that second half of the experience where with Robert Merton, I never succeeded because it was just too intimidating. It was like, oh no, I was able to chip in and help,",

And so it's just a completely different model, which worked much, much better. - What was it that made that so accessible, so fun, so natural to just add something? - Well, I think it's, you know, especially in the early days, and this, by the way, has gotten much harder because there are fewer topics that are just greenfield, you know, available. But, you know, you could say, oh, well I, you know, I know a little bit about this and I can get it started. But then it is fun to come back then and see other people have added and improved and so on and so forth. And that idea of collaborating, you know, where people can much like open source software, you know, you put your code out and then people suggest revisions and they change it, and it modifies and it grows beyond the original creator. It's just like, kind of a fun, wonderful, quite geeky hobby, but people enjoy it. - How much debate was there over the interface, over the details of how to make that seamless and frictionless? - Yeah, I mean, not as much as there probably should have been in a way. During that two years of the failure of Nupedia where very little work got done, what was actually productive was, there was a huge long discussion, email discussion, very clever people talking about things like neutrality, talking about what is an encyclopedia, but also talking about more technical ideas, you know, things back then, XML was kinda all the rage and thinking about, ah, could we, you know, shouldn't you have certain data that might be in multiple articles that gets updated automatically? So for example, you know, the population of New York City, every 10 years there's a new official census, couldn't you just update that bit of data in one place and it would update across all languages. That is a reality today. But back then it was just like, hmm, how do we do that? How do we think about that? - So that is a reality today where it's- - [Jimmy] Yeah. - There's some-",

I mean, it's a pretty advanced thing, but there are advanced users who are doing that. And then when that gets updated, it updates in all the languages where you've done that. - I mean, that's really interesting. There was this chain of emails in the early days of discussing the details of what is- - [Jimmy] Yeah, yeah. - So there's the interface, there's the- - Yeah, so the interface, so an example, there was some software called UseModWiki, which we started with. It's quite amusing actually, because the main reason we launched with UseModWiki is that it was a single perl script. So it was really easy for me to install it on the server and just get running. But it was, you know, some guy's hobby project, it was cool but it was just a hobby project and all the data was stored in flat text files, so there was no real database behind it. So to search the site, you basically used grep which is just like the basic Unix utility to like look through all the files. So that clearly was never gonna scale. But also in the early days, it didn't have real logins. So you could set your username, but there were no passwords. So, you know, I might say Bob Smith, and then someone else comes along and says, no, I'm Bob Smith and they both had it. Now that never really happened. We didn't have a problem with it, but it was kind of obvious, like, you can't grow a big website where everybody can pretend to be everybody. That's not gonna be good for trust and reputation and so forth. So quickly I had to write a little, you know, login, you know, store people's passwords and things like that. So you could have unique identities. And then another example of something, you know, quite, you would've never thought would've been a good idea, and it turned out to not be a problem, but to make a link in Wikipedia in the early days, you would make a link to a page that may or may not exist",

And that would make a link, but that was ugly. That was clearly not right. And so I was like, okay, well, that's just not gonna look nice. Let's just use square brackets. Two square brackets makes a link. And that may have been an option in the software. I'm not sure I thought up square brackets. But anyway, we just did that, which worked really well. It makes nice links and you know, you can see and its red links or blue links, depending on if the page exists or not. But the thing that didn't occur to me even think about is that, for example, on the German language standard keyboard, there is no square bracket. So for German Wikipedia to succeed, people had to learn to do some alt codes to get the square bracket, or they, a lot of users cut and paste a square bracket when they could find one, they would just cut and paste one in. And yet German Wikipedia has been a massive success. So somehow that didn't slow people down. - How is it that the German keyboards don't have a square bracket? How do you do programming? How do you, how do you live life to its fullest without square brackets? - That's a very good question. I'm not really sure. I mean, maybe it does now because keyboard standards have, you know, drifted over time and becomes useful to have a certain character. I mean, it's same thing. Like there's not really a w character in Italian. - [Lex] Yeah. - And it wasn't on keyboards, or I think it is now, but in general, w is not a letter in Italian language, but it appears in enough international words that it's crept into Italian, so- - And all of these things are probably Wikipedia articles in themselves. - [Jimmy] Oh yeah, oh yeah.

        "text": "And the difference between those two might be very, very interesting. So Wikidata is fascinating, but even the broader discussion of what is an encyclopedia? Can you go to that sort of philosophical question of- - [Jimmy] Sure. - What is an encyclopedia? - What is an encyclopedia? So the way I would put it is an encyclopedia, or what our goal is, is the sum of all human knowledge, but sum meaning summary. So, and this was an early debate. I mean, somebody started uploading the full text of Hamlet, for example, and we said, hmm, wait, hold on a second. That's not an encyclopedia article, but why not? So hence was born Wikisource, which is where you put original text and things like that, out of copyright text, because they said no, an encyclopedia article about Hamlet, that's a perfectly valid thing. But the actual text of the play is not an encyclopedia article. So most of it's fairly obvious, but there are some interesting quirks and differences. So for example, as I understand it, in French language encyclopedias, traditionally it would be quite common to have recipes, which in English language that would be unusual. You wouldn't find a recipe for chocolate cake in Britannica. And so, I actually don't know the current state, haven't thought about that in many, many years now- - State of cake recipes in Wikipedia, in English Wikipedia. - I wouldn't say there's chocolate cake recipes. I mean, you might find a sample recipe somewhere. I'm not saying they're none, but in general, no. Like, we wouldn't have recipes. - I told myself I would not get outraged in this conversation, but now I'm outraged. (Jimmy laughs) I'm deeply upset. - It's actually very complicated. I love to cook. I'm, you know, I'm actually quite a good cook. And what's interesting is there's, it's very hard to have a neutral recipe because- - [Lex] A canonical recipe for cake- - A canonical recipe- - [Lex] For chocolate cake. - Is kind of difficult to come by because there's so many variants and it's all debatable and interesting.",

But, you know, for many, many things, the variants are as interesting. You know, as you know, somebody said to me recently, you know, 10 Spaniards, 12 paella recipes. So, you know, these are all matters of open discussion. - Well, just to throw some numbers, as of May 27th, 2023, there are 6 million, 6.66 million articles in the English Wikipedia containing over 4.3 billion words. Including articles, the total number of pages is 58 million. - [Jimmy] Yeah. - Does that blow your mind? - I mean, yes, it does. I mean, it doesn't, because I know those numbers and see them from time to time, but in another sense, a deeper sense, yeah, it does. I mean, it's really remarkable. I remember when English Wikipedia passed 100,000 articles, and when German Wikipedia passed 100,000. 'Cause I happened to be in Germany with a bunch of wikipedians that night. And, you know, then it seemed quite big. I mean, we knew at that time that it was nowhere near complete. I remember at Wikimania in Harvard, when we did our annual conference there in Boston, someone who had come to the conference from Poland had brought along with him a small encyclopedia, a single volume encyclopedia of biographies. So short biographies, normally a paragraph or so about famous people in Poland. And there were some 22,000 entries. And he pointed out that even then, 2006, Wikipedia felt quite big. And he said in English Wikipedia, there's only a handful of these, you know, less than 10%, I think he said. And so then you realized, yeah, actually, you know, who was the mayor of Warsaw in 1873? Don't know. Probably not in English Wikipedia, but it probably might be today. But there's so much out there.

So sometimes people say, oh, there should be no limit. But I think that doesn't stand up to much scrutiny if you really pause and think about it. So I see in your hand there, you've got a Bic pen. Pretty standard, everybody's seen, you know, billions of those in life. - Classic though. - It's a classic clear, Bic pen. So could we have an entry about that Bic pen? Well, I bet we do, that type of Bic pen, because it's classic, everybody knows it and it's got a history. And actually, there's something interesting about the Bic company. They make pens, they also make kayaks, and there's something else they're famous for. So basically they're sort of a definition by non-essentials company. Anything that's long and plastic, that's what they make, so- (laughs) - [Lex] Wow, that's great. - If you wanna find the common ground. - The platonic form of a Bic. - But could we have an article about that very Bic pen in your hand? So Lex Friedman's Bic pen as of this week. - [Lex] Oh, the very, this instance- - The very specific instance. And the answer is no, there's not much known about it. I dare say, unless you know it's very special to you and your great-grandmother gave it to you or something, you probably know very little about it. It's a pen, it's just here in the office. And so that's just to show there is a limit. I mean, in German Wikipedia, they used to talk about the rear nut of the wheel of Uli Fuchs's bicycle. Uli Fuchs, well-known wikipedian of the time, to sort of illustrate like you can't have an article about literally everything. And so then it raises the question, what can you have an article about, what can't you, and that can vary depending on the subject matter. One of the areas where we try to be much more careful would be biographies. The reason is a biography of a living person, if you get it wrong, you can actually",

So for example, an encyclopedia article about my mother. My mother, school teacher later a pharmacist, wonderful woman, but never been in the news. I mean, other than me talking about why there shouldn't be a Wikipedia entry, that's probably made it in somewhere, standard example. But you know, there's not enough known. And you could sort of imagine a database of genealogy having date of birth, date of death, and, you know, certain elements like that of private people. But you couldn't really write a biography. And one of the areas this comes up quite often is what we call BLP1E, we've got lots of acronyms. Biography of a living person who's notable for only one event is a real sort of danger zone. - [Lex] Oh. - And the type of example would be a victim of a crime. So someone who's a victim of a famous serial killer, but about whom, like really not much is known. They weren't a public person, they're just a victim of a crime. We really shouldn't have an article about that person. They'll be mentioned, of course, and maybe this specific crime might have an article. But for that person, no, not really. That's not really something that makes any sense, because how can you write a biography about someone you don't know much about? And this is, you know, it varies from field to field. So for example, for many academics, we will have an entry that we might not have in a different context. Because for an academic, it's important to have sort of their career, you know, what papers they've published, things like that. You may not know anything about their personal life, but that's actually not encyclopedic relevant in the same way that it is for member of a royal family, where it's basically all about the family. So, you know, we're fairly nuanced about notability and where it comes in. And I've always thought that the term notability I think is a little problematic.

Is there a way to get information that actually makes an encyclopedia entry? - It so happens that there's a Wikipedia page about me, as I've learned recently. And the first thought I had when I saw that was, surely I am not notable enough. So I was very surprised and grateful that such a page could exist. And actually just allow me to say thank you to all the incredible people that are part of creating and maintaining Wikipedia. It's my favorite website on the internet, the collection of articles that Wikipedia has created. It's just incredible. - Thank you. We'll talk about the various details of that. But the love and care that goes into creating pages for individuals, for a Bic pen, for all this kind of stuff is just really incredible. So I just felt the love when I saw that page. But I also felt, just cause I do this podcast and I just, through this podcast, gotten to know a few individuals that are quite controversial. I've gotten to be on the receiving end of something quite, to me as a person who loves other human beings, I've gone to be at the receiving end of some kind of attacks through the Wikipedia forum. Like you said, when you look at living individuals, it can be quite hurtful. - [Jimmy] Mm-hm, yeah. - The little details of information. And because I've become friends with Elon Musk and I've interviewed him, but I've also interviewed people on the left, far left, people on the right, some people would say far right. And so now you take a step, you put your toe into the cold pool of politics and the shark emerges from the depths and pulls you right in. - [Jimmy] Yeah, the boiling hot pool of politics.

But the little battle about the biography there also starts becoming important for the first time for me. I also wanna clarify sort of personally, I use this opportunity of some inaccuracies there. My father was not born in Chkalovsk, Russia. He was born in Kiev, Ukraine. I was born in Chkalovsk, which is a town, not in Russia. There is a town called that in Russia. But there's another town in Tajikistan, which is a former republic of the Soviet Union. It is, that town is now called B U S T O N, Buston, which is funny 'cause we're now in Austin and I also am in Boston. And it seems like my whole life is surrounded by these kinds of towns.

And so, you know, some of the things have to do with, and this is a common debate that goes on in Wikipedia, is what we call undue weight. So I'll give an example. There was a article I stumbled across many years ago about the mayor, or no, he wasn't a mayor, he was a city council member of, I think he was Peoria, Illinois, but some small town in the midwest. And the entry, you know, he's been on the city council for 30 years or whatever. He's pretty, I mean frankly, pretty boring guy and seems like a good local city politician. But in this very short biography, there was a whole paragraph, a long paragraph about his son being arrested for DUI, and it was clearly undue weight. It's like, what has this got to do with this guy if it even deserves a mention? It wasn't even clear had he done anything hypocritical, had he done himself anything wrong, even was his son, his son got a DUI, that's never great, but it happens to people and it doesn't seem like a massive scandal for your dad. So of course I just took that out immediately. This is a long, long time ago. And that's the sort of thing where, you know, we have to really think about in a biography and about controversies to say, is this a real controversy? So in general, like one of the things we tend to say is like any section- So if there's a biography and there's a section called controversies, that's actually poor practice because it just invites people to say, oh, I wanna work on this entry. I see there's seven sections. Oh, this one's quite short. Can I add something? - [Lex] Right. - Go out and find some more controversies. Now that's nonsense, right? And in general, putting it separate from everything else kind of makes it seem worse and also, it doesn't put it in the right context.",

So that's, you know, that's, you know, part of the whole process. But I think for me, one of the most important things is what I call community health. So yeah, are we gonna get it wrong sometimes? Yeah, of course we're humans and doing good quality, you know, sort of reference material is hard. Real question is how do people react, you know, to a criticism or a complaint or a concern. And if the reaction is defensiveness or combativeness back or if someone's really sort of in there being aggressive and in the wrong, no, no, no, hold on, we've gotta do this the right way. You gotta say, okay, hold on. You know, are there good sources? Is this contextualized appropriately? Is it even important enough to mention? What does it mean? You know, and sometimes one of the areas where I do think there is a very complicated flaw and you've alluded to it a little bit, but it's like, we know the media is deeply flawed. We know that journalism can go wrong. And I would say particularly in the last whatever 15 years, we've seen a real decimation of local media, local newspapers. We've seen a real rise in click bait headlines and sort of eager focus on anything that might be controversial. We've always had that with us. Of course there's always been tabloid newspapers. But that makes it a little bit more challenging to say, okay, how do we sort things out when we have a pretty good sense that not every source is valid. So as an example, a few years ago, it's been quite a while now, we deprecated the Mail Online as a source, and the Mail Online, you know, the digital arm of the Daily Mail, it's a tabloid. It's not completely, you know, it's not fake news, but it does tend to run very hyped up stories. They really love to attack people and go on the attack for political reasons and so on.",

So certainly, you know, if the Daily Mail runs a headline saying New Cure for Cancer, it's like, you know, probably there's more serious sources than a tabloid newspaper. So, you know, in an article about lung cancer, you probably wouldn't cite the Daily Mail. Like that's kind of ridiculous. But also for celebrities and so forth, to sort of, you know, well they do cover celebrity gossip a lot, but they also tend to have vendettas and so forth. And you really have to step back and go, hmm, is this really encyclopedic or is this just the daily mail going on a rant? - And some of that requires a great community health.

Someone left a note on my user talk page in English Wikipedia saying, it was quite a dramatic headline saying racist hook on front page. So we have on the front page of Wikipedia, we have a little section called Did You Know? And it's just little tidbits and facts, just things people find interesting. And there's a whole process for how things get there. The one that somebody was raising a question about was, it was comparing a very well known US football player, black, there was a quote from another famous sport person comparing him to a Lamborghini. Clearly a compliment. And so somebody said, actually here's a study, here's some interesting information about how black sports people are far more often compared to inanimate objects and given that kind of analogy, and I think it's demeaning to compare a person to a car, et cetera, et cetera. But they said, I'm not pulling, I'm not deleting it, I'm not removing it. I just wanna raise the question. And then there's this really interesting conversation that goes on where I think the general consensus was, you know what, this isn't like the alarming headline, racist thing on the front page of a Wikipedia. That sounds, holy moly, that sounds bad. But it's sort of like, actually yeah, this probably isn't the sort of analogy that we think is great. And so we should probably think about how to improve our language and not compare sports people to inanimate objects and particularly be aware of certain racial sensitivities that there might be around that sort of thing. If there is a disparity in the media of how people are called. And I just thought, you know what, nothing for me to weigh in on here. This is a good conversation. Like nobody's saying, you know,",

I said, yeah, you know, that's good. - On the sort of deprecation of news sources, this is really interesting because I think what you're saying is ultimately you wanna make a article by article decision, kind of use your own judgment. And it's such a subtle thing because there's just a lot of hit pieces written about individuals like myself for example, that masquerade as kind of an objective thorough exploration of a human being. It's fascinating to watch because controversy and hit pieces just get more clicks. - [Jimmy] Oh yeah, sure. - I guess as a Wikipedia contributor, you start to deeply become aware of that and start to have a sense, like a radar of click bait versus truth. Like to pick out the truth from the click baity-type of language. - Oh yeah. I mean it's really important and you know, we talk a lot about weasel words, you know. And you know, actually I'm sure we'll end up talking about AI and ChatGPT, but just to quickly mention in this area, I think one of the potentially powerful tools because it is quite good at this, I've played around with and practiced it quite a lot, but ChatGPT-4 is really quite able to take a passage and point out potentially biased terms, to rewrite it to be more neutral. Now it is a bit anodyne and it's a bit, you know, cliched, so sometimes it just takes the spirit out of something that's actually not bad. It's just like, you know, poetic language and you're like, well okay, that's not actually helping. But in many cases I think that sort of thing is quite interesting.

(laughs) - GPT is trained on Wikipedia and then there's like this interesting loop where the weasel words and the nuances can get lost or can propagate, even though they're not grounded in reality. Somehow in the generation of the language model, new truths can be created and kind of linger. - Yeah, there's a famous web comic that's titled Cytogenesis, which is about how something, an error's in Wikipedia and there's no source for it, but then a lazy journalist reads it and writes the source. - [Lex] Yeah. - And then some helpful Wikipedian spots that it has no source, finds a source and adds it to Wikipedia.

I'm not gonna put a source for Austin as a city in Texas. That's just general knowledge. I learned it somewhere, I can't tell you where. So you don't have to cite and reference every single thing.

So the discussion was that they're building something in Israel and for their own political reasons, one side calls it a wall harkening back to Berlin Wall, apartheid. The other calls it a security fence. So we can understand quite quickly if we give it a moment's thought like, okay, I understand why people would have this grappling over the language. Like, okay, you want to highlight the negative aspects of this and you wanna highlight the positive aspects, so you're gonna try and choose a different name. And so there was this really fantastic Wikipedia discussion on the talk page. How do we word that paragraph to talk about the different naming?

Oh, okay, I understand what this debate is about now. - And just the term Israel-Palestine conflict is still the title of a page in Wikipedia, but the word conflict is something that is a charged word. - [Jimmy] Of course, yeah. - Because from the Palestinian side or from certain sides, the word conflict doesn't accurately describe the situation because if you see it as a genocide, one way genocide is not a conflict because to that, to people that discuss, that challenge the word conflict, they see, you know, conflict is when there's two equally powerful sides fighting. - Sure, yeah, yeah.",

Same thing with certain things like photos, you know, it's like, well, there's different photos, which one's best? A lot of different views on that.

And you know, I think you can always point to specific entries and talk about specific biases, but that's part of the process of Wikipedia. Anyone can come and challenge and to go on about that. But, you know, I see fairly often on Twitter, you know, some, you know, sort of quite extreme accusations of bias. And I think, you know, actually I just, I don't see it. I don't buy that.

So it's certainly true that some people who have quite fringe viewpoints and who knows, the full rush of history in 500 years, they might be considered to be pathbreaking geniuses. But at the moment, quite fringe views. And they're just unhappy that Wikipedia doesn't report on their fringe views as being mainstream. And that, by the way, goes across all kinds of fields.

So, you know, it depends. And, you know, I think it's something that we should always be vigilant about, but it's, you know, in general, I think we're pretty good. And I think any time you go to any serious political controversy, we should have a pretty balanced perspective on who's saying what and what the views are and so forth. I would actually argue that the areas where we are more likely to have bias that persists for a long period of time are actually fairly obscure things, or maybe fairly non-political things.",

Because almost no one knows about Japanese anime except for fans. And so the people who come and spend their days writing Japanese anime articles, they love it. They kind of have an inherent love for the whole area. Now they'll, of course, being human beings, they have their internal debates and disputes about what's better or not, you know. But in general, they're quite positive because nobody actually cares. On anything that people are quite passionate about, then hopefully, you know, there's like quite a lot of interesting stuff. So I'll give an example, a contemporary example where I think we've done a good job as of my most recent sort of look at it. And that is the question about the efficacy of masks during the COVID pandemic. And that's an area where I would say the public authorities really kind of jerked us all around a bit, you know. In the very first days they said, whatever you do, don't rush out and buy masks. And their concern was shortages in hospitals. Okay, fair enough. Later it's like, no, everybody's gotta wear a mask everywhere. It really works really well and it's, you know. Then now I think it's, the evidence is mixed, right? Masks seem to help, in my personal view. Masks seem to help, they're no huge burden. You know, you might as well wear a mask in any environment where you're with a giant crowd of people and so forth, but it's very politicized, that one. And it's very politicized where certainly in the US you know, much more so. I mean, I live in the UK, I live in London. I've never seen kind of on the streets sort of, the kind of thing that I, there's a lot of reports of people actively angry because someone else is wearing a mask, that sort of thing, in public. And so because it became very politicized, then clearly if Wikipedia- No, so anyway, if you go to Wikipedia and you research this topic, I think you'll find more or less what I've just said.

Hopefully, we've got quality sources. So then hopefully those people who read this can say, oh, actually, you know, it is complicated. (laughs) You know, if you can get to the point of saying, okay, this is, I have my view, but I understand other views and I do think it's a complicated question. Great, now we're a little bit more mature as a society. - Well, that one is an interesting one because I feel like I hope that that article also contains the meta conversation about the politicization of that topic. - [Jimmy] Yeah. - To me it's almost more interesting than whether the masks work or not, at least at this point. - [Jimmy] Sure. - It's like why it became, masks became a symbol of the oppression of a centralized government. If you wear them, you're a sheep that follows the mass control, the mass hysteria of an authoritarian regime. And if you don't wear a mask, then you are a science denier, anti-vaxxer. A alt-right, probably a Nazi. (laughs) So- - Exactly. And that whole politicization of society is just so damaging. And I don't know, in broader, in the broader world, like how do we start to fix that? That's a really hard question. - Well, at every moment, because you mentioned mainstream and fringe, there seems to be a tension here, and I wonder what your philosophy is on it. Because there's mainstream ideas and there's fringe ideas. You look at lab leak theory for this virus. There could be other things we can discuss where there's a mainstream narrative, where if you just look at the percent of the population or the population with platforms, what they say, and then what is a small percentage in opposition to that?

And so this can be quite hard, particularly when emotions are high. That's just a fact about human beings. I'll give a simpler example because there's not a lot of emotion around it. Like our entry on the moon doesn't say, some say the moon's made of rocks, some say cheese, you know, who knows? That kind of false neutrality is not what we want to get to. Like, that doesn't make any sense. But that one's easy. Like we all understand, I think there is a Wikipedia entry called something like the moon is made of cheese, where it talks about this is a common sort of joke or thing that children say or that people tell to children or whatever. You know, it's just a thing. It's a, everybody's heard moon's made of cheese. But nobody thinks wow, like Wikipedia is so one-sided. It doesn't even acknowledge the cheese theory. I'd say the same thing about flat earth, you know, again, it's very- - That's exactly what I'm looking up right now. - Very little controversy. We will have an entry about flat earth theory, theorizing flat earth people. My personal view is most of the people who claim to be flat earthers are just having a laugh, trolling and more power to them, have some fun, but let's not be, you know, ridiculous. - Of course, for most of human history, people believed that the earth is flat. So the article I'm looking at is actually kind of focusing on this history. Flat earth is an archaic and scientifically disproven conception of the earth's shape as a plane or disc, meaning ancient cultures subscribed to a flat earth cosmography with pretty cool pictures of what a flat earth would look like. With dragon, is that dragon? No, angels on the edge. There's a lot of controversy about that. What is on the edge? Is it the wall, is it angels, the dragons? - [Jimmy] Yeah, yeah. - Is there a dome? - And how can you fly from South Africa to Perth? Because on a flat earth view,",

'Cause I think there's a sizeable percent of the population who at least will say they believe in a flat earth. - [Jimmy] Yeah. - I think it is a movement that just says that the mainstream narrative to have distrust and skepticism about the mainstream narrative, which to a very small degree is probably a very productive thing to do. It's part of the scientific process, but you can get a little silly and ridiculous with it. - Yeah. I mean, yeah, it's exactly right. And so, you know, I think I find on many, many cases, and of course I, like anybody else might quibble about this or that in any Wikipedia article. But in general, I think there is a pretty good sort of willingness and indeed eagerness to say, oh, let's fairly represent all of the meaningfully important sides. So there's still a lot to unpack in that, right? So meaningfully important. So, you know, people who are raising questions about the efficacy of masks. Okay, that's actually a reasonable thing to have a discussion about. And hopefully we should treat that as a fair conversation to have and actually address which authorities have said what and so on and so forth.

Or the article on the earth certainly won't have a paragraph that says, well, most scientists think it's round, but certain people think flat. Like that's just a silly thing to put in that article.

So to me the question there is, I mean the same is true for Silicon Valley. The task for Silicon Valley is to create platforms that are not politically biased- - [Jimmy] Right. - Even though there is a bias for the engineers who create it. And I think, I believe it's possible to do that, you know, there's kind of conspiracy theories that it somehow is impossible and there's this whole conspiracy where the left is controlling it and so on.

And I'm not sure if that's true or if it just feels that way, but I also, I'm not sure what the causes are. I think I would lay a lot of the blame in recent years on social media algorithms which reward click bait headlines, which reward tweets that go viral and they go viral because they're cute and clever.

I mean, it's funny because at the time I was texting with Elon who's very pleasant to me and all of that. It's like- - He might have been a little bit shitty. The reporter might have been a little bit shitty, but you fed into the shitty with snarky funny response, not for sale. - [Jimmy] Yeah. - And like, where do you, like what- So that's a funny little exchange and you could probably after that laugh it off- - [Jimmy] Yeah. - And it's fun. But like that kind of mechanism that rewards the snark- - [Jimmy] Yeah. - Can go into viciousness. - Yeah, yeah, well, and we certainly see it online, you know, like a series of tweets, you know, sort of a tweet thread of 15 tweets that assesses the quality of the evidence for masks, pros and cons and sort of wear this, that's not gonna go viral, you know, but, you know, a smack down for a famous politician who is famously in favor of masks who also went to a dinner and didn't wear a mask, that's gonna go viral. And you know, that's partly human nature. You know, people love to call out hypocrisy and all of that. But it's partly what these systems elevate automatically. I talk about this with respect to Facebook, for example. So I think Facebook has done a pretty good job, although it's taken longer than it should in some cases. But, you know, if you have a very large following and you're really spouting hatred or misinformation, disinformation, they've kicked people off, they've done, you know, some reasonable things there. But actually the deeper issue is of this, the anger we're talking about, of the contentiousness of everything. I make of a family example with two great stereotypes.

Or, you know, maybe let's not invite him this year, you know, the normal human drama. He's got his three mates down at the pub who listen to him and, and all of that. But now grandma's got, you know, 54 followers on Facebook, which is the intimate family and racist uncle has 714. So he's not a massive influencer or whatever. But how did that happen? It's because the algorithm notices, oh, when, when she posts, nothing happens. He posts and then everybody jumps in to go, God, shut up Uncle Frank. You know, like, that's outrageous. And it's like, oh, there's engagement, there's page views, there's ads, right? And those algorithms, I think they're working to improve that, but it's really hard for them. It's hard to improve that if that actually is working, if the people who are saying things that get engagement, if it's not too awful, but it's just, you know, like maybe it's not a racist uncle, but maybe it's an uncle who posts a lot about what an idiot Biden is, right? Which isn't necessarily an offensive or blockable or bannable thing, and it shouldn't be. But if that's the discourse that gets elevated because it gets a rise out of people, then suddenly in a society it's like, oh, this is, we get more of what we reward. So I think that's a piece of what's gone on. - Well, if we could just take that tangent, I'm having a conversation with Mark Zuckerberg, second time. Is there something you can comment on how to decrease toxicity on that particular platform, Facebook? You also have worked on creating a social network that is less toxic yourself. - [Jimmy] Yeah. - So can we just talk about the different ideas that these already big social network can do and what you have been trying to do?",

So I don't, the problem with making a recommendation to Facebook is that I actually believe their business model makes it really hard for them. And I'm not anti-capitalism. I'm not, you know, great, somebody's got a business, they're making money. That's not where I come from. But certain business models mean you are gonna prioritize things that maybe aren't that long term helpful. And so that's a big piece of it. So certainly for Facebook, you could say, you know, with vast resources, start to prioritize content that's higher quality, that's healing, that's kind. Try not to prioritize content that seems to be just getting a rise out of people. Now those are vague human descriptions, right? But I do believe good machine running algorithms you can optimize in slightly different ways. But to do that, you may have to say actually we're not necessarily gonna increase page views to the maximum extent right now. And I've said this to people at Facebook, it's like, you know, if your actions are, you know, convincing people that you're breaking western civilization, that's really bad for business in the long run. Certainly these days I'll say, Twitter is the thing that's on people's minds as being more upsetting at the moment. But I think it's true. And so one of the things that's really interesting about Facebook compared to a lot of companies is that Mark has a pretty unprecedented amount of power. His ability to name members of the board, his control of the company is pretty hard to break. even if financial results aren't as good as they could be, because he's taken a step back from the perfect optimization to say, actually for the long-term health in the next 50 years of this organization, we need to reign in some of the things that are working for us and making money because they're actually giving us a bad reputation. So one of the recommendations I would say is, and this is not to do with the algorithms and all that, but you know, how about just a moratorium on all political advertising? I don't think it's their most profitable segment, but it's given rise to a lot of deep hard questions",

We're not constrained by the European process. Similarly, for people who are advocates of fox hunting to say, finally, when we're out of Europe, we can re-implement. So you're telling people what they want to hear, and in some cases it's really hard for journalists to see that. So it used to be that for political advertising, you really needed to find some kind of mainstream narrative. And this is still true to an extent, mainstream narrative, that 60% of people can say, oh, I can buy into that. Which meant it pushed you to the center, it pushed you to sort of try and find some nuanced balance. But if your main method of recruiting people is a tiny little one-on-one conversation with them, because you're able to target using targeted advertising, suddenly you don't need consistent. You just need a really good targeting operation, really good Cambridge analytic style, machine learning algorithm data to convince people. And that just feels really problematic. So, I mean, until they can think about how to solve that problem, I would just say, you know what, it's gonna cost us X amount, but it's gonna be worth it to kind of say, you know what? We actually think our political advertising policy hasn't really helped contribute to discourse and dialogue and finding reasoned, you know, middle ground and compromised solutions. So let's just not do that for a while until we figure that out. So that's maybe a piece of advice I'd- - And coupled with, as you were saying, recommender systems for the newsfeed and other contexts that don't always optimize engagement, but optimize the long term mental wellbeing and balance and growth of a human being. - [Jimmy] Yeah. - But it's a very difficult problem.",

So we'll start with a core base of our tiny community who I think are sensible, thoughtful people, wanna recruit more. But to say, you know what, actually let's have that as a pretty strong element to say, let's not optimize based on what gets the most page views in this session. Let's optimize on what sort of the feedback from people is, this is meaningfully enhancing my life. And so part of that is, and it's probably not a good business model, but part of that is say, okay, we're not gonna pursue an advertising business model, but a you know, membership model where, you know, you can, you don't have to be a member, but you can pay to be a member. You maybe get some benefit from that. But in general, to say actually, the problem with- And actually the division I would say is, and the the analogy I would give is broadcast television funded by advertising gives you a different result than paying for HBO, paying for Netflix, paying for whatever. And the reason is, you know, if you think about it, what is your incentive as a TV producer? You're gonna make a comedy for ABC network in the US. You basically say, I want something that almost everybody will like and listen to. So it tends to be a little blander, you know, family friendly, whatever. Whereas if you say, oh, actually I'm gonna use the HBO example and an old example, you say you know what, Sopranos isn't for everybody. Sex and the city isn't for everybody. But between the two shows, we've got something for everybody that they're willing to pay for.

The piece of that that I like is to say, look, actually, if there's a model where your revenue is coming from people who are willing to pay for the service, even if it's only part of your revenue, if it's a substantial part, that does change your broader incentives to say, actually, are people gonna be willing to pay for something that's actually just toxicity in their lives? Now, I'm not sure it's been rolled out well, I'm not sure how it's going, and maybe I'm wrong about that as a plausible business model.

But let's, since you mentioned Twitter, what do you think works and what do you think is broken about Twitter? - Oof, I mean, it's a long conversation, but to start with, one of the things that I always say is it's a really hard problem. So I can see that right up front. I said this about, you know, the old ownership of Twitter and the new ownership of Twitter.

So I click report and I report the tweet and there's five others and I report, and I go through the process and then I get an email that says, you know, whatever, couple hours later, saying thank you for your report, we're looking into this. Great, okay, good. Then several hours further I get an email back saying, sorry, we don't see anything here to violate our terms of use. And I'm like, okay. So I emailed Jack and I say, Jack, come on. Like this is ridiculous. And he emails back roughly saying, yeah, sorry Jimmy, don't worry, we'll sort this out. And I just thought to myself, you know what, that's not the point, right? I'm Jimmy Wales, I know Jack Dorsey, I can email Jack Dorsey. He'll listen to me 'cause he's got an email from me and sorts it out for me. What about the teenager who's being bullied and is getting abuse, right? And getting accusations that aren't true. Are they getting the same kind of like really poor result in that case? So fast forward a few years, same thing happens. The the exact quote, it goes, please help me, I'm only 10 years old and Jimmy Wales raped me last week. It's like, come on, fuck off, like that's ridiculous. So I report him, I'm like, this time I'm reporting, but I'm thinking, well we'll see what happens. This one gets even worse because then I get same result email back saying sorry we don't see any problems. So I raise it with other members of the board who I know and Jack and like this is really ridiculous. - [Lex] Yeah. - Like this is outrageous.

Like you need to get the police involved. Twitter's not the place for that accusation. So even back then, by the way, they did delete those tweets, but I mean the rationale they gave is spammy behavior. - [Lex] Right. - So completely separate from abusing me. It was just like, oh well they were retweeting too often. Okay, whatever. So like that's just broken. Like that's a system that it's not working for people in the public eye. I'm sure it's not working for private people who get abuse, really horrible abuse can happen. So how is that today? Well, it hasn't happened to me since Elon took over, but I don't see why it couldn't. And I suspect now if I send a report and email someone, there's no one there to email me back.

And I don't know the full answer to this. I mean a piece of it could be, you know, to say actually making specific allegations of crimes, this isn't the place to do that. You know, we've got a huge database. If you've got an accusation of crime, here's who should call, the police, the FBI, whatever it is. It's not to be done in public. And then you do face really complicated questions about #metoo movement and people coming forward in public and all of that. But it's again, it's like probably you should talk to a journalist, right?

I think that's really important. Now, how is it specifically implemented? Is it scalable or that I don't really know how they've done it, so I can't really comment on that. But in general, I do think it's, you know, when you're only mechanisms on Twitter and you're a big Twitter user, you know, we know the platform and you've got plenty of followers and all of that. The only mechanisms are retweeting, replying, blocking. It's a pretty limited scope and it's kind of good if there's a way to elevate a specific thoughtful response. And it kind of goes to again, like does the algorithm just pick the retweet or the- I mean retweeting, it's not even the algorithm that makes it viral. Like, you know, if Paulo Coelho, very famous author, I think he's got like, I don't know, I haven't looked lately. He used to have 8 million Twitter followers. I think I looked, he's got 16 million now or whatever. Well if he retweets something, it's gonna get seen a lot. Or Elon Musk, if he retweets something, it's gonna get seen a lot. That's not an algorithm, that's just the way the platform works. So it is kind of nice if you have something else and how that something else is designed, that's obviously complicated question. - Well there's an interesting thing that I think Twitter's doing, but I know Facebook is doing for sure, which is really interesting. So you have, what are the signals that a human can provide at scale? Like and Twitter, it's retweet. - [Jimmy] Yep. - In Facebook, I think you can share, I think.

There's so many interpretations to I would like to see less of this. - [Jimmy] For sure. - But if you get that kind of signal, this actually can create a really powerfully curated list of content that is fed to you every day. That doesn't create an echo chamber or a silo, that actually just makes you feel good in the good way. Which is like, it challenges you but it doesn't exhaust you.

If they're both kind and thoughtful, like that's the important part. They're never gonna agree the on the topic, but they will understand, okay, like Wikipedia is not gonna take a side, but Wikipedia is gonna explain what the debate is about and we're gonna try to characterize it fairly.

But they can grapple with ideas and they can discuss and they may feel very proud of the entry at the end of the day, not because they suppress the other side's views, but because they think the case has been stated very well that other people can come to understand it. And if you're highly ideological, you assume, I think naturally, if people understood as much about this as I do, they'll probably agree with me.

And I think if you read the article, it's pretty good. And I think a piece of that is within our community, if people have the self-awareness to understand. So I personally wouldn't go and edit the entry on Donald Trump. I get emotional about it and I'm like, I'm not good at this. And if I tried to do it, I would fail. I wouldn't be a good wikipedian. So it's better if I just step back and let people who are more dispassionate on this topic edit it. Whereas there are other topics that are incredibly emotional to some people where I can actually do quite well. Like I'm gonna be okay. Maybe, we were discussing earlier the efficacy of masks. I'm like, oh, I think that's an interesting problem and I don't know the answer, but I can help kind of catalog what's the best evidence and so on. I'm not gonna get upset, I'm not gonna get angry. I'm able to be a good wikipedian. So I think that's important. And I do think though, in a related framework that the composition of the community is really important. Not because Wikipedia is or should be a battleground, but because blind spots. Like maybe I don't even realize what's biased. If I'm particularly of a certain point of view and I've never thought much about it. So one of the things we focus on a lot, the Wikipedia volunteers are, we don't know the exact number, but let's say 80% plus male and they're of a certain demographic, they tend to be college educated, heavier on tech geeks than not, you know, et cetera, et cetera.",

And women as well. So we do have women in the community and that's very important. But we do think, okay, you know what, that does lead to some problems. It leads to some content issues simply because people write more about what they know and what they're interested in. They'll tend to be dismissive of things as being unimportant if it's not something that they personally have an interest in. I, you know, I like the example as a parent, I would say our entries on early childhood development probably aren't as good as they should be.

So the demographic has changed a bit, but- - [Lex] That's funny. - You know, it's like if you've got a bunch of 25 year old tech geek dudes who don't have kids, they're just not gonna be interested in early childhood development. And if they tried to write about it, they probably wouldn't do a good job 'cause they don't know anything about it. And somebody did a look at our entries on novelists who've won a major literary prize. And they looked at the male novelist versus the female. And the male novelist had longer and higher quality entries. And why is that? Well, it's not because, 'cause I know hundreds of Wikipedians, it's not because these are a bunch of biased, sexist men who are like, books by women are not important. It's like, no, actually there is a gender kind of breakdown of readership. There are books like hard science fiction's a classic example.

I don't know if you've noticed, but I think this person is actually quite hurt that you keep making that joke about them. And then they usually go, oh, you know what?

I was at the dinner, we were in Egypt at WikiMania in Alexandria, and at the sort of closing dinner or whatever. And a friend of mine came and sat at the table and she's sort of been in the movement more broadly, Creative Commons, so she's not really a wikipedian. She'd come to the conference 'cause she's into Creative Commons and all that. So we have dinner and it just turned out, I sat down at the table with most of the members of the English language arbitration committee. And they're a bunch of very sweet, geeky wikipedians. And as we left the table, I said to her, it's really like, I still find this kind of sense of amazement. Like we just had dinner with some of the most powerful people in English language media, 'cause they're the people who are like the final court of appeal in English Wikipedia.

And I'm just like, isn't that wild, right? That you would think, I mean, first of all, most people never even think about like, how do computers know about time zones?

But there's this one guy and he doesn't get paid for it, it's just, he's like, you know, with all the billions of people on the planet, he sort of put his hand up and goes, yo, I'll take care of the time zones, you know?

(Jimmy laughs) Like when you spot 'em in the wild, you just want to be like, well careful. - [Jimmy] Yeah. - That thing needs to be treasured. - No, I met a guy many years ago, lovely, really sweet guy and he was running a bot on English Wikipedia that I thought, wow, that's actually super clever. And what he had done is his bot was like spell checking. But rather than simple spell checking, what he had done is create a database of words that are commonly mistaken for other words. They're spelled wrong, so I can even give an example. And so the word is, people often spell it wrong, but no spell checker catches it because it is another word. And so what he did is he wrote a bot that looks for these words and then checks the sentence around it for certain keywords. So in some context, this isn't correct, but buoy and boy. People sometimes type BOY when they mean BOUY. So if he sees the word boy, B O Y, in an article, he would look in the context and see is this a nautical reference? And if it was, he didn't auto correct, he just would flag it up to himself to go, oh, check this one out. And that's not a great example, but he had thousands of examples. And I was like, wow, that's amazing. Like I would've never thought to do that and I'm glad that somebody did. And that's also part of the openness of the system.

And we don't have any ads on the site and the vast majority of the money is from donations. But the vast majority from small donors. So people giving 25 bucks or whatever. - If you're listening to this, go donate. - [Jimmy] Go donate. - Donate now. - [Jimmy] 25 bucks. - I've donated so many times. - And we have, you know, millions of donors every year. But it's like a small percentage of people. I would say in the early days, a big part of it was aesthetic, almost as much as anything else. It was just like, mm, I just think I don't really want ads on Wikipedia. Like, I just think it would be, there's a lot of reasons why it might not be good. And even back then, I didn't think as much as I have since about a business model can tend to drive you in a certain place. And really thinking that through in advance is really important because you might say, yeah, we're really, really keen on community control and neutrality, but if we had an advertising-based business model, probably that would begin to erode. Even if I believe in it very strongly, organizations tend to follow the money, in the DNA in the long run. And so things like, I mean it's easy to think about some of the immediate problems. So like if you go to read about, I don't know, Nissan, car company and if you saw an ad for the new Nissan at the top of the page, you might be like, did they pay for this? Or like, do the advertisers have influence over the content? Because you kind of wonder about that for all kinds of media. - And that undermines trust.",

So anyway, it was the dust up that was, you know, when you look at it as a Wikipedia and you're like, oh, like this is a really routine kind of editorial debate. Another example, which unfortunately our friend Elon fell for, I would say is the Twitter files. So there was an article called the Twitter files, which is about these files that were released once Elon took control of Twitter and he released internal documents. And what happened was somebody nominated it for deletion, but even the nomination said this is actually, this is mainly about the Hunter Biden laptop controversy. Shouldn't this information be there instead? So anyone can, like it takes exactly one human being anywhere on the planet to propose something for deletion. And that triggers a process where people discuss it, which within a few hours, it was what we call snowball closed, ie. this doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell of passing. So an admin goes yeah, wrong, and closed the debate and that was it. That was the whole thing that happened. And so nobody proposed suppressing the information. Nobody proposed it wasn't important.",

And you know, I read the Wikipedia articles around that and I also read books on the conflict and the history of the different regions.

(Jimmy laughs) They can't see the truth. I mean, it's something I ask myself all the time, forget the leftist, just crack pot in general. Am I just being a sheep and accepting it? And I think that's an important question to always ask, but not too much. - Yeah, no, I agree completely. - [Lex] A little bit, but not too much. - Yeah, no, I think we always have to challenge ourselves of like, what do I potentially have wrong? - Well, you mentioned pressure from government.

There's also conspiracy theories or accusations of Wikipedia being open to pressure from government to government organizations, FBI and all this kind of stuff. - [Jimmy] Right. - What is the philosophy about pressure from government and censorship? - So we're super hardcore on this. We've never bowed down to government pressure anywhere in the world, and we never will. And we understand that we're hardcore and actually there is a bit of nuance about how different companies respond to this, but our response has always been just to say no. And if they threaten to block, well knock yourself out, you're gonna lose Wikipedia. And that's been very successful for us as a strategy because governments know they can't just casually threaten to block Wikipedia or block us for two days and we're gonna cave in immediately to get back into the market. And that's what a lot of companies have done. And I don't think that's good. But we can go one level deeper and say, I'm actually quite sympathetic. Like if you have staff members in a certain country and they are at physical risk, you've gotta put that into your equation. So I understand that. Like, if Elon said, actually I've got a hundred staff members on the ground in such and such a country, and if we don't comply, somebody's gonna get arrested and it could be quite serious. Okay, that's a tough one, right? That's actually really hard.

And I said, I actually reached out to staff and said can you just make sure I've got my facts right?

We're not gonna cave into any kind of government pressure, but whatever the appropriateness of what they were doing, I think there is a rule for government in just saying, let's understand the information ecosystem. Let's think about the problem of misinformation, disinformation in society, particularly around election security, all these kinds of things.

But it would also be irresponsible to go, oh dear, government agent's not happy, let's fix Wikipedia so the FBI loves us. - So when you say you wanna have discussions with the Chinese government or with organizations like CDC and WHO, it's to thoroughly understand what the mainstream narrative is so that it can be properly represented but not drive what the articles are. - Well, it's actually important to say like whatever the Wiki Media Foundation thinks has no impact on what's in Wikipedia.

And one of the reasons I love it is when it was created early in the history of Wikipedia, it kind of became like a dumping ground. People would just come by and write in any word that they thought sounded funny.

And a lot of famous comedians and humorists have written about it. And it's, you know, it's actually a legitimate topic. So then they went through and they meticulously referenced every word that was in there and threw out a bunch that weren't. And so it becomes this really interesting, and now my biggest disappointment, and it's the right decision to make because there was no source, but there was a picture of a cow, but there was a rope around its head, tying on some horns onto the cow.

        "text": "- Yeah, I think that's exactly right. And you know, at Fandom, my for-profit wiki company where, you know, it's like all these communities about pop culture mainly, sort of entertainment, gaming and so on. There's a lot of small communities. And so I went last year to our community connect conference and just met some of these people and like, you know, here's one of the leaders of the Star Wars wiki, which is called Wookipedia, which I think is great. And you know, he's telling me about his community and all that and I'm like, oh right, yeah, I love this. Like, so it's not the same purpose as Wikipedia of a neutral high quality encyclopedia, but a lot of the same values are there of like, oh people should be nice to each other. It's like when people get upset it's like, just remember we're working on Star Wars wiki together. Like there's no reason to get too outraged and just kind people, just like geeky people with a hobby. - Where do you see Wikipedia in 10 years, 100 years and 1000 years? (Jimmy makes dramatic dun-dun-dun sound) - Right, so 10 years. I would say pretty much the same. Like we're not gonna have, we're not gonna become TikTok, you know, with entertainment, you know, scroll by video humor and blah blah blah. An encyclopedia. I think in 10 years we probably will have a lot more AI-supporting tools like I've talked about. And probably your search experience would be, you can ask a question and get the answer rather than, you know, from our body of work. - So search and discovery a little bit improved. - [Jimmy] Yeah, yeah. - The interface some of the- - All that. I always say one of the things that people, most people won't notice because already they don't notice it, is the growth of Wikipedia in the languages of the developing world. So you probably don't speak Swahili so you're probably not checking out that Swahili Wikipedia is doing very well, and it is doing very well. And I think that kind of growth is actually super important. It's super interesting but most people won't notice that. - If we can just link on that, if we could. Do you think there's so much incredible translation work",

        "text": "is being done with AI, with language models, do you think that can accelerate? - [Jimmy] Yeah, I do. - Wikipedia? So you start with the basic draft of the translation of articles and then build on top of that. - Yeah, so what I used to say is like machine translation for many years wasn't much use to the the community 'cause it just wasn't good enough. As it's gotten better, it's tended to be a lot better in what we might call economically important languages. That's because the corpus that they train on and all of that. So to translate from English to Spanish, if you've tried Google Translate recently, Spanish to English is what I would do. It's pretty good, like it's actually not bad. It used to be half a joke and then for a while it was kind of like, well you can get the gist of something and now it's like, actually it's pretty good. However, we've got a huge Spanish community who write in native Spanish so they're able to use it and they find it useful but they're writing. But if you tried to do English to Zulu where there's not that much investment, like there's loads of reasons to invest in English to Spanish cause they're both huge, economically important languages. Zulu not so much, so for those smaller languages, it was just still terrible. My understanding is it's improved dramatically and also because the new methods of training don't necessarily involve identical corpuses to try to match things up, but rather reading and understanding with tokens and large language models and then reading and understanding and then you get a much richer- Anyway, apparently it's quite improved. So I think that now, it is quite possible that these smaller language communities are gonna say, oh well finally, I can put something in in English and I can get out Zulu that I feel comfortable sharing with my community because it's actually good enough or I can edit it a bit here and there. So I think that's huge. So I do think that's gonna happen a lot and that's gonna accelerate, again what will remain to most people an invisible trend.",

        "text": "But that's the growth in all these other languages. So then move on to a hundred years- - [Lex] That was starting to get scary. - Well, the only thing I'd say about a hundred years is like we've built the Wikimedia Foundation and we run it in a quite cautious and financially conservative and careful way. So every year we build our reserves. Every year we put aside a little bit of more money, we also have the endowment fund, which we just passed a hundred million, that's a completely separate fund with a separate board so that it's not just like a big fat bank account for some future profiting CEO to blow through that, you know, the foundation will have to get the approval of a second order board to be able to access that money. And that board can make other grants through the community and things like that. So the point of all that is I hope and believe that we are building, you know, in a financially stable way. That we can weather various storms along the way so that hopefully we're not taking the kind of risks and by the way, we're not taking too few risks either. That's always hard. I think the Wikimedia Foundation and Wikipedia will exist in a hundred years, if anybody exists in a hundred years, we'll be there. - Do you think the internet just looks unpredictably different? The, just the web? - I do, I do. I mean, I think right now, this sort of enormous step forward we've seen has become public in the last year of the large language models, really is something else, right? It's really interesting and you and I have both talked today about the flaws and the limitations, but still, as someone who's been around technology for a long time, it's sort of that feeling of, the first time I saw a web browser, the first time I saw the iPhone, like the first time the internet was like really usable on a phone. And it's like, wow, that's a step change difference. There's a few other, you know- - Maybe Google search. - [Jimmy] Google search was actually one. - I remember the first search-",

And it's gonna have some downsides. Like, you know, the negative use case. I'm, you know, people in the area who are experts, they're giving a lot of warnings and I don't know enough to, I'm not that worried, but I'm a pathological optimist. But I do see some like really low hanging fruit, bad things that can happen. So my example is how about some highly customized spam where the email that you receive isn't just like misspelled words and like trying to get through filters, but actually is a targeted email to you that knows something about you by reading your LinkedIn profile and writes a plausible email that will get through the filters. And it's like suddenly oh, hmm, that's a new problem. That's gonna be interesting. - Is there a, just on the Wikipedia editing side, does it make the job of the volunteer of the editor more difficult if, in a world where larger and larger percentage of the internet is written by an LLM? - So one of my predictions, and we'll see, you know, ask me again in five years how this panned out, is that in a way, this will strengthen the value and importance of some traditional brands. So if I see a news story and it's from the Wall Street Journal, from the New York Times, from Fox News, I know what I'm getting and I trust it to whatever extent I might have, you know, trust or distrust in any of those. And if I see a brand new website that looks plausible but I've never heard of it and it could be machine generated content that may be full of errors, I think I'll be more cautious. I think I'm more interested.",

However, if I see a photo of, the recent was the Pope wearing an expensive puffer jacket, I'm gonna go, yeah, that's amazing that a fake like that could be generated. But my immediate thought is not, oh, so the pope's dipping into the money, eh? Partly 'cause this particular pope doesn't seem like he'd be the type. - My favorite is extensive pictures of Joe Biden and Donald Trump hanging out and having fun together. - Yeah. (laughs) Brilliant. So I think people will care about the provenance of a photo and if you show me a photo and you say, yeah, this photo is from Fox News, even though I don't necessarily think that's the highest, but I'm like, well it's a news organization and they're gonna have journalists and they're gonna make sure the photo is what it's purports to be. That's very different from a photo randomly circulating on Twitter. Whereas I would say 15 years ago, a photo randomly circulating on Twitter, in most cases the worst you could do, and this did happen, is misrepresent the battlefield. So like, oh, here's a bunch of injured children, look what Israel's done. But actually it wasn't Israel, it was another case 10 years ago. That has happened, that has always been around, but now we can have much more specifically constructed, plausible looking photos that if I just see them circulating on Twitter, I'm gonna go, hmm, just don't know, not sure. Like I can make that in five minutes, so- - Well I also hope that it's kind of like what you're writing about in your book, that we could also have citizen journalists that have a stable, verifiable trust that builds up. So it doesn't have to be New York Times for this organization, that you could be an organization of one as long as it's stable and carries through time and it builds up or builds out. - No, no, I agree.",

That's just like if a New York Times reporter said it. Like, I'm gonna tend to think he didn't just make it up. Truth is, nothing interesting ever happens around me. I don't go to war zones, I don't go to big press conferences, I don't interview Putin and Zelenskyy, right? So to an extent, yes. Whereas I do think for other people, those traditional models of credibility are really, really important. And then there is this sort of citizen journalism. I don't know if you think of what you do as journalism. I kind of think it is, but you do interviews, you do long form interviews and I think people, you know, like if you come and you say, right, here's my tape, but you wouldn't hand out a tape. Like I just gestured to you as if I'm handing you a cassette tape. If you put it into your podcast, here's my interview with Zelenskyy. And people aren't gonna go, yeah. How do we know, that could be a deep fake. Like you could have faked that. 'Cause people are like, well no, like you're a well known podcaster and you do interview interesting people and yeah, like you wouldn't think that. So that your brand becomes really important. Whereas if suddenly, and I've seen this already, I've seen sort of video with subtitles in English and apparently the Ukrainian was the same and has Zelenskyy saying something really outrageous and I'm like, yeah, don't believe that. Like I don't think he said that in a meeting with, you know, whatever. I think that's Russian propaganda or probably just trolls. - Yeah, and then building platforms and mechanisms of how that trust can be verified.

And then each, hopefully there's millions of people with different metrics of trust. - Yeah. - And then you could see that there's a certain kind of bias in the set of conversations you're having. So maybe, okay, I trust this person to have this kind of bias and I'll go to this other person, have this other kind of bias and I can integrate them in this kind of way, just like you said with Fox News and whatever (indistinct). - Yeah, Washington Journal, New York Times. Like they've all got their, like where they sit. Yeah. - So you have built, I would say, one of, if not the most impactful website in the history of human civilization.

High schoolers, college students- - [Jimmy] Yeah, no. - Wanting to have a big positive impact on the world. - Yeah, right. If you wanna be successful, do something you're really passionate about rather than some kind of cold calculation of what can make you the most money. 'Cause if you go and try to do something and you're like, I'm not that interested, but I'm gonna make a lot of money doing it, you're probably not gonna be that good at it. And so that is a big piece of it. I also like, you know, so for startups, I give this advice so young- And this is a career startup. Any kind of like young person just starting out, is like, you know, be persistent, right? There'll be moments when it's not working out and you can't just give up too easily. You've gotta persist through some hard times. Maybe two servers crash on a Sunday and you've gotta sort of scramble to figure it out. But persist through that. And then also be prepared to pivot.

Is this a moment when I need to just power through and persist because I'm gonna find a way to make this work? Or is this a moment where I need to go, actually this is totally not working and I need to change direction. But also I think for me, that always gives me a framework of like, okay, let's, okay, here's a problem. Do we need to change direction or do we need to kind of power through it? And just knowing like those are the choices and they're not always the only choices, but those are choices. I think can be helpful to say, okay, am I chickening out? Like 'cause I'm having a little bump and I'm feeling an emotion and I'm just gonna give up too soon, okay? Yeah, ask yourself that question. And also it's like, am I being pigheaded and trying to do something that actually doesn't make sense? Okay, ask yourself that question, too. Even though they're contradictory questions, sometimes it'll be one, sometimes it'll be the other and you gotta really think it through. - I think persisting with the business model behind Wikipedia is such an inspiring story because we live in a capitalist world. We live in a scary world, I think, for an internet business. And so- - [Jimmy] Yeah. - And so like to do things differently than a lot of websites are doing. Like what Wikipedia has lived through, the successive explosion of many websites that are basically ad-driven. Google is ad-driven, Facebook, Twitter, all of these websites are ad-driven. And to see them succeed, become these like incredibly rich, powerful companies that if I could just have that money, you would think as somebody running Wikipedia, I could do so much positive stuff, right?

I mean I always like to give an example of MySpace 'cause I just think it's an amusing story. So MySpace was poised, I would say, to be Facebook, right? It was huge, it was viral, it was lots of things. Kind of foreshadowed a bit of maybe even TikTok because it was like a lot of entertainment content, casual. And then Rupert Murdoch bought it and it collapsed within a few years. And part of that I think was because they were really, really heavy on ads and less heavy on the customer experience. So I remember to accept a friend request was like three clicks where you saw three ads and on Facebook you accept the friend request, you didn't even leave the page. It just like, that just accepted. But what is interesting, so I used to give this example of like, yeah, well, Rupert Murdoch really screwed that one up. And in a sense, maybe he did, but somebody said, you know what actually he bought it for, and I don't remember the numbers. He bought it for 800 million and it was very profitable through its decline. And he actually made his money back and more. So it wasn't like, from a financial point of view, it was a bad investment in the sense of you could have been Facebook, but on sort of more mundane metrics, it's like, hmm, actually it worked out okay for him. - [Lex] It all matters how you define success. - It does. And that is also advice to young people. One of the things I would say, like when we have our mental models of success as an entrepreneur, for example, and your examples in your mind are Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg. So people who at a very young age had one really great idea that just went straight to the moon and became one of the richest people in the world.",

It's like if you measure your financial success by thinking about billionaires, like that's heavy. Like, that's probably not good. I don't recommend it.

What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing? Why are we here, human civilization? What's the meaning of life? - Yeah, I don't think there is a external answer to that question. - And I should mention that there's a very good Wikipedia page on the different philosophies of the meaning of life. - Oh, interesting. I have to read that and see what I think. Hopefully it's neutral and gives a wide range- - Oh, it's a really good reference to a lot of different philosophies about meaning. The 20th century philosophy in general from from Nietzche to the existentialist to all Simone de Beauvoir, all of them have an idea of meaning. They really struggled systematically, rigorously. And that's what the page- And obviously a shout out to the Hitchhiker's Guide and all that kind of stuff. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, so I think there's no external answer to that. I think it's internal. I think we decide what meaning we will have in our lives and what we're gonna do with ourselves. And so when I think, you know, if we're talking about thousand years, millions of years, Yuri Milner wrote a book, he's a big internet investor guy. He wrote a book advocating quite strongly for humans exploring the universe and getting off the planet. And he funds projects to like send, like using lasers to send little cameras and interesting stuff. And he talks a lot in the book about meaning. It's like his view is that the purpose of the human species is to broadly survive and get off the planet. Well, I don't agree with everything he has to say 'cause I think that's not a meaning that can motivate most people in their own lives. It's like, okay, great.

Like this is not what you think about in your day-to-day life, is like, where is the human species going to be in 10 million years? And it does make you sort of turn back to earth and say, gee, let's not destroy the planet. Like we kind of, we're stuck here for at least a while. And therefore we should really think about sustainability. And I mean, 1 million years sustainability. And we don't have all the answers, we have nothing close to the answers. I'm actually excited about AI in this regard while also bracketing. Yeah, I understand there's also risks and people are terrified of AI. But I actually think it is quite interesting, this moment in time that we may have in the next 50 years, to really, really solve some really long-term human problems. For example, in health, I think the progress that's being made in cancer treatment because we are able to at scale, you know, model molecules and genetics and things like this. It gets huge, it's really exciting, you know.

And I think another important one if we fail to do that, for me is propagating and maintaining the full diversity and richness and complexity and expansiveness of human knowledge.

But there's, I was in Norway, in Bergen, Norway, where every year they've got this annual festival called Buekorps which is young groups drumming, and they have a drumming competition. It's the 17th sectors of the city, and they've been doing it for a couple hundred years or whatever. They wrote about it in the three languages of Norway. And then from there, it was translated into English, into German, et cetera, et cetera. And so what I love about that story is, what it reminds me is like this machine translation goes both ways. And like, when you talk about the richness and broadness of human culture, we're already seeing some really great pieces of this. So like Korean soap operas, really popular. Not with me, but with people. And the ability to, you know, imagine taking a very famous, very popular, very well known Korean drama. And now, I mean, and I literally mean now, we're just about there technologically where we use a machine to re-dub it in English in an automated way, including digitally editing the faces so it doesn't look dubbed. And so suddenly you say, oh wow. Like here's a piece of, you know, it's the Korean equivalent of, maybe it's Friends as a comedy or maybe it's Succession, just to be very contemporary. It's something that really impacted a lot of people and they really loved it. And we have literally no idea what it's about. - [Lex] Yeah. - And suddenly it's like, wow, you know, like music, street music from wherever in the world, it can suddenly become accessible to us all in new ways.
