        "text": "so let's talk about linear algebra a little bit because it is such a it's both a powerful and a beautiful a subfield of mathematics so what's your favorite specific topic in linear algebra or even math in general to give a lecture on to convey to tell the story to teach students okay well on the teaching side so it's not deep mathematics at all but I I'm kind of proud of the idea of the four subspaces there are four fundamental subspaces which are of course known before long before my name for them but can you go through them can you go through the future I can yes so the first one to understand is so the matrix is maybe I should say the matrix what is the matrix what's a matrix well so we have a like a rectangle of numbers so it's got n columns got a bunch of columns and also got an M rows let's say and the relation between so of course the columns and the rows it's the same numbers so there's got to be connections there but they're not simple the they're much the columns might be longer than the rows and they've all different the numbers are mixed up first space to think about is take the columns so those are vectors those are points in n dimensions what's the vector so a physicist would imagine a vector or might imagine a vector as a arrow you know in space or the point it ends at in space for me it's a column of numbers does it you often think of this is very interesting in terms of linear algebra the ends of a vector you think a little bit more abstract than the how it's very commonly used perhaps yeah you think this arbitrary Speight multi-dimensional right away I'm in high dimensions and in the room and yeah that's right in the lecture I tried a so if you think of two vectors in ten dimensions I'll do this in class and I'll readily admit that I have no good image in my mind of a vector of arrow int n dimensional space but whatever you can you can add one",

        "text": "bunch of ten numbers to another bunch of ten numbers so you can add a vector to a vector and you can multiply a vector by three and that's if you know how to do those you've got linear algebra you know ten dimensions yeah you know there's this beautiful thing about math if you look string theory and all these theories which are really fundamentally derived through math yeah but are very difficult to visualize it yeah how do you think about the things like a 10 dimensional vector that we can't really visualize yeah do you and and yet math reveals some beauty Oh underlying me yeah our world in that weird thing we can't visualize how do you think about that difference well probably I'm not a very geometric person so I'm probably thinking in three dimensions and the beauty of linear algebra is that is that it goes on to ten dimensions with no problem I mean that if you're just seeing what happens if you add two vectors in 3d you then you can add them in 10 D you're just adding the ten components so so I I can't say that I have a picture but yet I try to push the class to think of a flat surface in ten dimensions so a plane in ten dimensions and so that's one of the spaces take all the columns of the matrix take all their combinations so uh so much of this column so much of this one then if you put all those together you get some kind of a flat surface that I call a vector space space of vectors and and my imagination is just seeing like a piece of paper in 3d but anyway so that's one of the spaces the nuts space number one the column space of the matrix and then there's the row space which is as I said different but came came from the same numbers so we got the column space all combinations of the columns and then we've got the row space all combinations of the rows so those are those words are easy for me to say and I can't really draw them on a blackboard but I try with",
