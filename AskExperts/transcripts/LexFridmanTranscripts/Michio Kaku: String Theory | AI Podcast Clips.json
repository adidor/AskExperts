        "text": "- And you see, string theory is a multiverse theory. So people say, first of all, \"What is string theory?\" String theory simply says that all the particles we see in nature, the electron, the proton, quarks, what have you, are nothing but vibrations on a musical string, on a tiny, tiny little string. You know, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the creator of the atomic bomb, was so frustrated in the 1950s with all these subatomic particles being created in our atom smashers, that he announced. He announced one day, that the Nobel Prize in physics should go to the physicist who does not discover a new particle that year. Well today, we think they're nothing but musical notes on these tiny little vibrating strings. So, what is physics? Physics is the harmonies you can write on vibrating strings. What is chemistry? Chemistry is the melodies you can play on these strings. What is the universe? The universe is a symphony of strings. And then, what is the mind of God, that Albert Einstein so eloquently wrote about for the last 30 years of his life? The mind of God would be cosmic music, resonating through 11-dimensional hyperspace.",
