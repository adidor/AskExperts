        "text": "[Music] so I gotta ask you I think this is a fundamental and fascinating question because iRobot has been a successful company and a rare successful robotics company so Anki geebo nade field robotics with a robot curry sci-fi works rethink robotics these were robotics companies that were founded and run by brilliant people but all very unfortunately for at least for us roboticists that and all went out of business recently so why do you think they didn't last longer why do you think it is so hard to keep a robotics company alive you know I say this only partially in jest that back in the day before Roomba you know I was a I was a high-tech entrepreneur building robots but it wasn't until I became a vacuum cleaner salesman that we had any success so though I mean the point is technology alone doesn't equal a successful business we need to go and find the compelling need where the robot that we're creating can deliver clearly more value to the end user than it costs and it's this is not a marginal thing where you're looking at the skin like it's closed maybe we can hold our breath and make it work it's clearly more value than the the cost of the robot to bring you know in the store and I think that the challenge has been finding those businesses where that's true in a sustainable fashion you know the the when you get into entertainment style things you could be the cat's meow one year but 85% of toys regardless of their merit fail to make it to their second season it's just super hard to do so and so that that's just a tough business and there have been a lot of experimentation around what is the right type of social companion what is the right robot in the home that is doing something other than tasks people do every week that they'd rather not do and I'm not sure we've got it all figured out right and so that you",
