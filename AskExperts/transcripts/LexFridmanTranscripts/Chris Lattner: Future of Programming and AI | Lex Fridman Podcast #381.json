And so what happened with both TensorFlow and PyTorch is that the explosion of innovation in AI has led to, it's not just about matrix implication and convolution. These things have now, like, 2,000 different operators. And on the other hand, you have, I don't know how many pieces of hardware out there are there, it's a lot. Part of my thesis, part of my belief of where computing goes, if you look out 10 years from now, is it's not gonna get simpler. Physics isn't going back to where we came from. It's only gonna get weirder from here on out, right? And so to me, the exciting part about what we're building is it's about building that universal platform, which the world can continue to get weird 'cause, again, I don't think it's avoidable, it's physics, but we can help lift people, scale, do things with it, and they don't have to rewrite their code every time a new device comes out. And I think that's pretty cool. - The following is a conversation with Chris Lattner, his third time on this podcast. As I've said many times before, he's one of the most brilliant engineers in modern computing, having created LLVM Compiler Infrastructure project, the Clang compiler, the Swift programming language, a lot of key contributions to TensorFlow and TPUs as part of Google. He's served as Vice President of Autopilot Software at Tesla, was a software innovator and leader at Apple. And now he co-created a new full stack AI infrastructure for distributed training, inference, and deployment on all kinds of hardware called Modular, and a new programming language called Mojo. That is a superset of Python, giving you all the usability of Python, but with the performance of C, C++. In many cases, Mojo code has demonstrated over 30,000x speed up over Python. If you love machine learning, if you love Python, you should definitely give Mojo a try. This programming language,",

This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Chris Lattner. It's been, I think two years since we last talked, and then in that time, you somehow went and co-created a new programming language called Mojo. So it's optimized for AI. It's a superset of Python. Let's look at the big picture. What is the vision for Mojo? - For Mojo? Well, so I mean, I think you have to zoom out. So I've been working on a lot of related technologies for many, many years. So I've worked on LLVM and a lot of things and mobile and servers and things like this, but the world's changing. And what's happened with AI is we have new GPUs and new machine learning accelerators and other ASICs and things like that, that make AI go real fast. At Google, I worked on TPUs. That's one of the biggest, largest scale deployed systems that exist for AI. And really what you see is, if you look across all of the things that are happening in the industry, there's this new compute platform coming. And it's not just about CPUs, or GPUs, or TPUs, or NPUs, or IPUs, or whatever, all the PUs, (chuckles) right? It's about, how do we program these things, right? And so for software folks like us, right, it doesn't do us any good if there's this amazing hardware that we can't use. And one of the things you find out really quick is that having the theoretical capability of programming something and then having the world's power and the innovation of all the smart people in the world get unleashed on something can be quite different. And so really where Mojo came from was, starting from a problem of, we need to be able to take machine learning, take the infrastructure underneath it and make it way more accessible, way more usable, way more understandable by normal people and researchers",

        "text": "and other folks that are not themselves like experts in GPUs and things like this. And then through that journey, we realized, \"Hey, we need syntax for this. We need to do a programming language.\" - So one of the main features of the language, I say so, fully in jest, is that it allows you to have the file extension to be an emoji or the fire emoji, which is one of the first emojis used as a file extension I've ever seen in my life. And then you ask yourself the question, why in the 21st century, we're not using Unicode for file extensions? This, I mean, it's an epic decision. I think, clearly, the most important decision you made the most, but you could also just use M-O-J-O as the file extension. - Well, so, okay. So take a step back. I mean, come on, Lex. You think that the world's ready for this? This is a big moment in the world, right? - We're releasing this onto the world. (chuckles) - This is innovation. - I mean, it really is kinda brilliant. Emojis are such a big part of our daily lives, why isn't it not in programming? - Well, and like you take a step back and look at what file extensions are, right, they're basically metadata, right? And so why are we spending all the screen space on them and all this stuff? Also, you know, you have them stacked up next to text files and PDF files and whatever else. Like, if you're gonna do something cool, you want it to stand out, right? And emojis are colorful. They're visual. They're beautiful, right? - Yeah. What's been the response so far from... Is there a support on like Windows on operating system- - Yeah. - In displaying like File Explorer? - Yeah, yeah. The one problem I've seen is the git doesn't escape it, right? And so it thinks that the fire emoji is unprintable. And so it like prints out weird hex things if you use the command line git tool, but everything else, as far as I'm aware, works fine. And I have faith that Git can be improved.",

Visual Studio Code, Windows, like all this stuff, totally ready because people have internationalization in their normal- - Yeah. - Part of their paths. So let's just like take the next step, right? Somewhere between, \"Oh, wow, that makes sense. Cool, I like new things,\" to \"Oh my god, you're killing my baby. Like, what are you talking about? This can never be. Like, I can never handle this. How am I gonna type this? (imitates bees buzzing) like, all these things. And so this is something where I think that the world will get there. We don't have to bet the whole farm on this. I think we can provide both paths, but I think it'll be great. - When can we have emojis as part of the code? I wonder. - Yeah. So, I mean, lots of languages provide that. So I think that we have partial support for that. It's probably not fully done yet, but yeah, you can do that. For example, in Swift, you can do that for sure. So an example we gave at Apple was the dog cow. - Yeah. - So that's a classical Mac heritage thing. And so you use the dog and the cow emoji together, and that could be your variable name, but of course, the internet went and made pile of poop for everything. - Yeah. - So, you know, if you wanna name your function pile of poop, then you can totally go to town and see how that gets through code review. (Lex chuckling) - Okay. So let me just ask a bunch of random questions. So is Mojo primarily designed for AI or is it a general purpose programming? - Yeah, good question. So it's AI first. And so AI is driving a lot of the requirements. And so Modular is building and designing and driving Mojo forward. And it's not because it's an interesting project, theoretically, to build. It's because we need it. And so at Modular, we're really tackling the AI infrastructure landscape and the big problems in AI and the reasons that is so difficult to use and scale",

Now, when you do that, when you start tackling these problems, you realize that the solution to these problems isn't actually an AI-specific solution. And so while we're doing this we're building Mojo to be a fully general programming language. And that means that you can obviously tackle GPUs, and CPUs and, like, these AI things, but it's also a really great way to build NumPy and other things like that, or, you know, just if you look at what many Python libraries are today, often they're a layer of Python for the API, and they end up being C and C++ code underneath them. That's very true in AI. That's true in lots of other demands as well. And so anytime you see this pattern, that's an opportunity for Mojo to help simplify the world and help people have one thing. - So optimize through simplification by having one thing. So you mentioned Modular. Mojo is the programming language. Modular is the whole software stack. - So just over a year ago, we started this company called Modular. - [Lex] Yeah. - Okay, what Modular's about is, it's about taking AI and up-leveling it into the next generation, right? And so if you take a step back, what's gone on in the last five, six, seven, eight years is that we've had things like TensorFlow and PyTorch and these other systems come in. You've used them. You know this. And what's happened is these things have grown like crazy, and they get tons of users. It's in production deployment scenarios. It's being used to power so many systems. I mean, AI's all around us now. It used to be controversial years ago, but now it's a thing. But the challenge with these systems is that they haven't always been thought out with current demands in mind. And so you think about it. Where were LLMs eight years ago? (chuckles) Well, they didn't exist, right? AI has changed so much, and a lot of what people are doing today are very different than when these systems were built. And meanwhile, the hardware side of this has gone into a huge mess.",

And so between that, you have like moving system on one side, moving system on the other side, and it just turns into this gigantic mess, which makes it very difficult for people to actually use AI, particularly in production deployment scenarios. And so what Modular's doing is we're helping build out that software stack to help solve some of those problems so then people can be more productive and get more AI research into production. Now, what Mojo does is it's a really, really, really important piece of that. And so that is, you know, part of that engine and part of the technology that allows us to solve these problems. - So Mojo is a programming language that allows you to do the higher level programming, the low-level programming, like do all kinds of programming in that spectrum that gets you closer and closer to the hardware. - So take a step back. So Lex, what do you love about Python? - Oh, boy. Where do I begin? What is love? What do I love about Python? - [Chris] You're a guy who knows love. I know this. - Yes. How intuitive it is, how it feels like I'm writing natural language English. - [Chris] Yeah. - How, when I can not just write, but read other people's codes, somehow I can understand it faster. It's more condensed than other languages, like ones I'm really familiar with, like C++ and C, there's a bunch of sexy little features. - [Chris] Yeah. - We'll probably talk about some of them, but list comprehensions and stuff like this. - Well, so Py... And don't forget the entire ecosystem of all the packages. - [Lex] Oh, yeah. There's probably huge- - 'Cause there's always something. If you wanna do anything, there's always a package. - Yeah, so it's not just the ecosystem of the packages and the ecosystem of the humans that do it.

Like, so I think that ML was very good for Python. And so I think that TensorFlow and PyTorch and these systems embracing Python really took and helped Python grow, but I think that the major thing underlying it is that Python's like the universal connector, right? It really helps bring together lots of different systems so you can compose them and build out larger systems without having to understand how it works. But then, what is the problem with Python? (chuckles) - Well, I guess you could say several things, but probably that it's slow. - I think that's usually what people complain about, right? And so, slow. I mean, other people would complain about tabs and spaces versus curly braces or whatever, but I mean, those people are just wrong 'cause it is- - Yeah. - Actually just better to use indentation. - Wow, strong words. (Chris laughing) So actually, I just went on a small tangent. Let's actually take that. Let's take all kinds of tangents. - Oh, come on, Lex. You can push me on it. I can take it. - Design, designed. Listen, I've recently left Emacs for VS Code. - [Chris] Okay. - And the kinda hate mail I had to receive, because on the way to doing that, I also said, I've considered Vim. - [Chris] Yep. - And chose not to and went with VS Code and just- - You're touching on deep religions, right? - Anyway, tabs is an interesting design decision. And so you've really written a new programming language here. Yes, it is a superset of Python, but you can make a bunch of different interesting decisions here. - Totally, yeah. - And you chose actually to stick with Python in terms of some of the syntax. - Well, so let me explain why, right? So I mean, you can explain this in many rational ways. I think that the annotation is beautiful, but that's not a rational explanation, right, but I can defend it rationally, right? So first of all, Python 1 has millions of programmers.",

Second of all, if you look at it, C code, SQL Plus code, Java, whatever, Swift, curly brace languages also run through formatting tools and get indented. And so if they're not indented correctly, first of all, will twist your brain around. (chuckles) It can lead to bugs. There's notorious bugs that have happened across time where the annotation was wrong or misleading and it wasn't formatted right, and so it turned into an issue, right? And so what ends up happening in modern large-scale code bases is people run automatic formatters. So now what you end up with is indentation and curly braces. Well, if you're gonna have, you know, the notion of grouping, why not have one thing, right, and get rid of all the clutter and have a more beautiful thing, right? Also, you look at many of these languages, it's like, okay, well, you can have curly braces, or you can omit them if there's one statement, or you just like enter this entire world of complicated design space that, objectively, you don't need if you have Python-style indentation, so. - Yeah, I would love to actually see statistics on errors made because of indentation. Like, how many errors are made in Python versus in C++ that have to do with basic formatting, all that kinda stuff? I would love to see. - I think it's probably pretty minor because once you get, like you use VS Code, I do too. So if you get VS Code set up, it does the annotation for you, generally, right? - Yep. - And so you don't, you know, it's actually really nice to not have to fight it. And then what you can see is the editors telling you how your code will work by indenting it, which I think is pretty cool. - I honestly don't think I've ever... I don't remember having an error in Python because I indented stuff wrong. - Yeah. So I mean, I think that there's, again, this is a religious thing.",

And so I like poking at the bear a little bit, right? But frankly, right, come back to the first point, Python 1, like, it's huge. - Yeah. - It's in AI. It's the right thing. For us, like, we see Mojo as being an incredible part of the Python ecosystem. We're not looking to break Python or change it, or, quote, unquote, \"fix it.\" We love Python for what it is. Our view is that Python is just not done yet. And so if you look at, you know, you mentioned Python being slow. Well, there's a couple of different things that go into that, which we can talk about if you want. But one of them is that it just doesn't have those features that you would use to do C-like programming. And so if you say, okay, well, I'm forced out of Python into C, for certain use cases, well, then what we're doing is we're saying, \"Okay, well, why is that? Can we just add those features that are missing from Python back up to Mojo?\" And then you can have everything that's great about Python, all the things that you're talking about that you love plus not be forced out of it when you do something a little bit more computationally intense, or weird, or hardware-y, or whatever it is that you're doing. - Well, a million questions I wanna ask, but high level again- - Yeah. - Is it compiled or is it an interpreted language? So Python is just-in-time compilation. What's Mojo? - So Mojo, a complicated answer, does all the things. So it's interpreted, it's JIT compiled, and it's statically compiled. (chuckles) And so this is for a variety of reasons. So one of the things that makes Python beautiful is that it's very dynamic. And because it's dynamic, one of the things they added is that it has this powerful metaprogramming feature. And so if you look at something like PyTorch or TensorFlow or, I mean, even a simple use case, like you define a class that has the plus method, right, you can overload the dunder methods, like dunder add, for example, and then the plus method works on your class.",

But the problem is, is you can't run those super dynamic features on an embedded processor or on a GPU, right? Or if you could, you probably don't want to just because of the performance. And so we entered this question of saying, okay, how do you get the power of this dynamic metaprogramming into a language that has to be super efficient in specific cases? And so what we did was we said, okay, well, take that interpreter. Python has an interpreter in it, right? Take that interpreter and allow it to run at compile time. And so now what you get is you get compiled time metaprogramming. And so this is super interesting, super powerful, because one of the big advantages you get is you get Python-style expressive APIs, you get the ability to have overloaded operators. And if you look at what happens inside of, like PyTorch, for example, with automatic differentiation and eager mode and like all these things, they're using these really dynamic and powerful features at runtime, but we can take those features and lift them so that they run at compile time. - 'Cause C++ has metaprogramming with templates. - [Chris] Yep. - But it's really messy. - It's super messy. It was accidentally, I mean, different people have different interpretations. My interpretation is that it was made accidentally powerful. It was not designed to be Turing-complete, for example, but that was discovered kind of along the way, accidentally. And so there have been a number of languages in the space. And so they usually have templates or code instantiation, code-copying features of various sorts. Some more modern languages or some newer languages, let's say, like, you know, they're fairly unknown. Like Zig, for example, says, okay, well, let's take all of those types you can run it, all those things you can do at runtime and allow them to happen at compile time.",

I mean, everybody hates me for a variety of reasons anyways, I'm sure, right? (chuckles) I've written up- - That's the way they show love is to hurt you. - I have written enough C++ code to earn a little bit of grumpiness with C++, but one of the problems with it is that the metaprogramming system templates is just a completely different universe from the normal runtime programming world. And so if you do metaprogramming and programming, it's just like a different universe, different syntax, different concepts, different stuff going on. And so, again, one of our goals with Mojo is to make things really easy to use, easy to learn, and so there's a natural stepping stone. And so as you do this, you say, okay, well, I have to do programming at runtime, I have to do programming at compile time. Why are these different things? - How hard is that to pull it off? 'Cause that sounds, to me, as a fan of metaprogramming and C++ even, how hard is it to pull that off? That sounds really, really exciting 'Cause you can do the same style programming at compile time and at runtime. That's really, really exciting. - Yep, yep, and so, I mean, in terms of the compiler implementation details, it's hard. I won't be shy about that. It's super hard. It requires, I mean, what Mojo has underneath the covers is a completely new approach to the design of the compiler itself. And so this builds on these technologies like MiR that you mentioned. That also includes other, like caching and other interpreters and JIT compilers and other stuff like that- - [Lex] So you have like an interpreter inside the- - Within the compiler, yes. - [Lex] Oh, man. - And so it really takes the standard model of programming languages",

Like, they grow macros or something, right? List, right? - Yes. - I know your roots, right? (Lex chuckling) You know, and this is a powerful thing, right? And so, you know, if you go back to list, one of the most powerful things about it is that it said that the metaprogramming and the programming are the same, right? And so that made it way simpler, way more consistent, way easier to understand, reason about, and it made it more composable. So if you build a library, you can use it both at runtime and compile time, which is pretty cool. - Yeah. And for machine learning, I think metaprogramming, I think we could generally say, is extremely useful. And so you get features, I mean, I'll jump around, but the feature of auto-tuning and adaptive compilation just blows my mind. - Yeah, well, so, okay. So let's come back to that. - [Lex] All right. - So what is machine learning, like, what, or what is a machine learning model? Like, you take a PyTorch model off the internet, right? - Yeah. - It's really interesting to me because what PyTorch and what TensorFlow and all these frameworks are kinda pushing compute into is they're pushing into, like, this abstract specification of a compute problem, which then gets mapped in a whole bunch of different ways, right? And so this is why it became a metaprogramming problem, is that you wanna be able to say, cool, I have this neural net. Now, run it with batch size a thousand, right? Do a mapping across batch. Or, okay, I wanna take this problem. Now, run it across a thousand CPUs or GPUs, right? And so, like, this problem of, like, describe the compute, and then map it and do things and transform it, or, like, actually it's very profound and that's one of the things that makes machine learning systems really special. - Maybe can you describe auto-tuning and how do you pull off, I mean,",

To me, from a quick glance of Mojo, which by the way, I have to absolutely, like, dive in, as I realize how amazing this is, I absolutely must dive in it, that looks like just an incredible feature for machine learning people. - Yeah. Well, so what is auto-tuning? So take a step back. Auto-tuning is a feature in Mojo. So very little of what we're doing is actually research, like many of these ideas have existed in other systems and other places. And so what we're doing is we're pulling together good ideas, remixing them, and making them into a, hopefully, a beautiful system, right? And so auto-tuning, the observation is that, turns out, hardware systems' algorithms are really complicated. Turns out maybe you don't actually want to know how the hardware works, (chuckles) right? A lot of people don't, right? And so there are lots of really smart hardware people, I know a lot of them, where they know everything about, \"Okay, the cache size is this and the number of registers is that. And if you use this what length of vector, it's gonna be super efficient because it maps directly onto what it can do\" and, like, all this kinda stuff, or, \"the GPU has SMs and it has a warp size of,\" whatever, right, all this stuff that goes into these things, or \"The tile size of a TPU is 128,\" like, these factoids, right? My belief is that most normal people, and I love hardware people, also I'm not trying to offend literally everybody on the internet, but most programmers actually don't wanna know this stuff, right? And so if you come at it from perspective of, how do we allow people to build both more abstracted but also more portable code because, you know, it could be that the vector length changes or the cache size changes, or it could be that the tile size of your matrix changes,",

And so what auto-tuning does is says, okay, well, guess what? There's a lot of compute out there, right? So instead of having humans go randomly try all the things or do a grid, search, or go search some complicated multi-dimensional space, how about we have computers do that, right? And so what auto-tuning does is you can say, Hey, here's my algorithm. If it's a matrix operation or something like that, you can say, okay, I'm gonna carve it up into blocks, I'm gonna do those blocks in parallel and I wanna this, with 128 things that I'm running on, I wanna cut it this way or that way or whatever. And you can say, hey, go see which one's actually empirically better on the system. - And then the result of that you cache for that system. You save it. - Yep. And so come back to twisting your compiler brain, right? So not only does the compiler have an interpreter that's used to do metaprogramming, that compiler, that interpreter, that metaprogramming now has to actually take your code and go run it on a target machine, (chuckles) see which one it likes the best, and then stitch it in and then keep going, right? - So part of the compilation is machine-specific. - Yeah. Well, so I mean, this is an optional feature, right? So you don't have to use it for everything, but yeah. So one of the things that we're in the quest of is ultimate performance, right? - Yes. - Ultimate performance is important for a couple of reasons, right? So if you're an enterprise, you're looking to save costs and compute and things like this. Ultimate performance translates to, you know, fewer servers. Like, if you care about the environment, hey, better performance leads to more efficiency, right? I mean, you could joke and say like, you know,",

And so if you move to Mojo, it's like, at least 10x better just outta the box, and then keep going, right? - Yeah. - But performance is also interesting 'cause it leads to better products. - Yeah. - And so in the space of machine learning, right, if you reduce the latency of a model so that it runs faster so every time you query the server running the model it takes less time, well, then the product team can go and make the model bigger. Well, that's actually makes it so you have a better experience as a customer. And so a lot of people care about that. - So for auto-tuning, for like tile size, you mentioned 120f for TPU. You would specify like a bunch of options to try, just in the code- - Yeah. Yep. - Just simple statement, and then you could just- - Yep. - Set and forget and know, depending wherever it compiles, it'll actually be the fastest. - And yeah, exactly. And the beauty of this is that it helps you in a whole bunch of different ways, right? So if you're building... So often what'll happen is that, you know, you've written a bunch of software yourself, right, you wake up one day, you say, \"I have an idea. I'm gonna go code up some code.\" I get to work, I forget about it, I move on with life. I come back six months, or a year, or two years, or three years later, you dust it off, and you go use it again in a new environment. And maybe your GPU is different. Maybe you're running on a server instead of a laptop, maybe you're, whatever, right? And so the problem now is you say, okay, well, I mean, again, not everybody cares about performance, but if you do, you say, okay, well, I wanna take advantage of all these new features. I don't wanna break the old thing though, right? And so the typical way of handling this kinda stuff before is, you know, if you're talking about C++ templates or you're talking about C with macros, you end up with #ifdefs. You get like all these weird things that get layered in, make the code super complicated,",

And, you know, that just doesn't scale very well. - Actually, lemme just jump around, before I go to some specific features, like the increase in performance here that we're talking about can be just insane. - Yeah. - You write that Mojo can provide a 35,000x speed up over Python. How does it do that? - Yeah, so I can even do more, but we'll get to that. So first of all, when we say that, we're talking about what's called CPython, it's the default Python that everybody uses. When you type Python 3, that's like typically the one you use, right? CPython is an interpreter. And so interpreters, they have an extra layer of, like bike codes and things like this, that they have to go read, parse, interpret, and it makes them kind of slow from that perspective. And so one of the first things we do is we moved to a compiler. And so just moving to a compiler, getting the interpreter out of the loop is 2 to 5 to 10x speed up, depending on the code. So just out of the gate, it's using more modern techniques right? Now, if you do that, one of the things you can do is you can start to look at how CPython started to lay out data. And so one of the things that CPython did, and this isn't part of the Python spec necessarily, but this is just sets of decisions, is that, if you take an integer for example, it'll put it in an object 'cause in Python, everything's an object. And so they do the very logical thing of keeping the memory representation of all objects the same. So all objects have a header, they have like payload data. And what this means is that every time you pass around an object, you're passing around a pointer to the data. Well, this has overhead, right? Turns out that modern computers don't like chasing pointers very much and things like this. It means that you have to allocate the data. It means you have to reference count it,",

And so if you say, okay, let's try to get that out of the heap, out of a box, out of an indirection and into the registers, that's another 10x, more. - So it adds up if you're reference counting every single- - Absolutely. - every single thing you create, that adds up. - Yep, and if you look at, you know, people complain about the Python GIL, this is one of the things that hurts parallelism. That's because the reference counting, right? And so the GIL and reference counting are very tightly intertwined in Python. It's not the only thing, but it's very tightly intertwined. And so then you lean into this and you say, okay, cool. Well, modern computers, they can do more than one operation at a time. And so they have vectors. What is a vector? Well, a vector allows you to, instead of taking one piece of data, doing an add or multiply and then pick up the next one, you can now do a 4, 8, or 16 or 32 at a time, right? Well, Python doesn't expose that because of reasons. And so now you can say, okay, well, you can adopt that. Now you have threads. Now you have like additional things, like you can control memory hierarchy. And so what Mojo allows you to do is it allows you to start taking advantage of all these powerful things that have been built into the hardware over time. The library gives very nice features. So you can say, just parallelize this. Do this in parallel, right? So it's very, very powerful weapons against slowness, which is why people have been, I think having fun, like just taking code and making go fast because it's just kind of an adrenaline rush to see like how fast you can get things. - Before I talk about some of the interesting stuff with parallelization and all that, let's first talk about, like, the basics. We talked the indentation, right? So this thing looks like Python. It's sexy and beautiful like Python as I mentioned. - [Chris] Yep. - Is it a typed language? So what's the role of types?",

        "text": "- Yeah, good question. So Python has types. It has strings, it has integers, it has dictionaries and like all that stuff, but they all live at runtime, right? And so because all those types live at runtime in Python, you never or you don't have to spell them. (chuckles) Python also has like this whole typing thing going on now and a lot of people use it. - [Lex] Yeah. - I'm not talking about that. That's kind of a different thing. We can go back to that if you want, but typically the, you know, you just say, I have a def and my def takes two parameters. I'm gonna call them A and B and I don't have to write or type okay? So that is great, but what that does is that forces what's called a consistent representation. So these things have to be a pointer to an object with the object header and they all have to look the same. And then when you dispatch a method, you go through all the same different paths no matter what the receiver, whatever that type is. So what Mojo does is it allows you to have more than one kind of type. And so what it does is allows you to say, okay, cool. I have an object and objects behave like Python does. And so it's fully dynamic and that's all great. And for many things, classes, like, that's all very powerful and very important. But if you wanna say, hey, it's an integer and it's 32 bits, or it's 64 bits or whatever it is, or it's a floating point value and it's 64 bits, well, then the compiler can take that, and it can use that to do way better optimization. And it turns out, again, getting rid of the indirections, that's huge. Means you can get better code completion 'cause compiler knows what the type is and so it knows what operations work on it. And so that's actually pretty huge. And so what Mojo does is allows you to progressively adopt types into your program. And so you can start, again, it's compatible with Python, and so then you can add however many types you want, wherever you want them. And if you don't wanna deal with it, you don't have to deal with it, right?",

I'm actually one of the people (sighs) that have not been using types very much in Python. So I haven't- - That's okay. Why did you sigh? - It just, well, because I know the importance. It's like adults use strict typing. And so I refuse to grow up in that sense. It's a kind of rebellion, but I just know that it probably reduces the amount of errors, even just for, forget about performance improvements, it probably reduces errors of when you do strict typing. - Yeah, so I mean, I think it's interesting if you look at that, right? And the reason I'm giving you a hard time then is that- - Yes. - there's this cultural norm, this pressure, this, like, there has to be a right way to do things. Like, you know- - Yes. - grownups only do it one way. And if you don't do that- - Yes. - you should feel bad, right? - Yes. - Like, some people feel like Python's a guilty pleasure or something, and that's like, when it gets serious, I need to go rewrite it, right? Well, I mean, cool. - Exactly. - I understand history and I understand kinda where this comes from, but I don't think it has to be a guilty pleasure, (chuckles) right? - Yeah. - So if you look at that, you say, why do you have to rewrite it?

If you don't care, you're prototyping some stuff, you're hacking some things out, you're, like, pulling some random code off the internet, it should just work, (chuckles) right? And you shouldn't be, like, pressured. You shouldn't feel bad about doing the right thing or the thing that feels good. Now, if you're in a team, right, you're working at some massive internet company and you have 400 million lines of Python code, well, they may have a house rule that you use types, right? - Yeah. - Because it makes it easier for different humans to talk to each other and understand what's going on and bugs at scale, right? And so there are lots of good reasons why you might wanna use types, but that doesn't mean that everybody should use 'em all the time, right? So what Mojo does is it says, cool. Well, allow people to use types and if you use types, you get nice things out of it, right? You get better performance and things like this, right?

It has to support for comprehension, list comprehensions and things like this, right? And so that starting point I think is really important. And I think that, again, you can look at why I care so much about this. And there's many different aspects of that, one of which is the world went through a very challenging migration from Python 2 to Python 3, right? - [Lex] Yes. - This migration took many years and it was very painful for many teams, right? - Yeah. - And there's of a lot of things that went on in that.

That definitely is incredible. We'll talk about that. - Yeah. - First of all, how's the typing implemented differently in Python versus Mojo? - Yeah. - So this heterogeneous flexibility you said is definitely implemented. - Yeah, so I'm not a full expert (chuckles) in the whole backstory on types in Python. So I'll give you that. I can give you my understanding. My understanding is, basically, like many dynamic languages, the ecosystem went through a phase where people went from writing scripts to writing large scale, huge code bases in Python. And at scale, kinda helps have types. - Yeah. - People wanna be able to reason about interfaces, do you expect string, or an int, or, like, these basic things, right? And so what the Python community started doing is it started saying, okay, let's have tools on the side, checker tools, right, that go and, like, enforce a variance, check for bugs, try to identify things. These are called static analysis tools generally. And so these tools run over your code and try to look for bugs. What ended up happening is there's so many of these things, so many different weird patterns and different approaches on specifying the types and different things going on, that the Python community realized and recognized, \"Hey, hey, hey, there's the thing here.\" (chuckles) And so what they started to do is they started to standardize the syntax for adding types to Python. Now, one of the challenges that they had is that they're coming from kinda this fragmented world where there's lots of different tools, they have different trade-offs and interpretations and the types mean different things. And so if you look at types in Python, according to the Python spec, the types are ignored, right? So according to the Python spec, you can write pretty much anything (chuckles)",

You can do cool things, you can write, build your own tools, you can build your own house, linter or something like that, right? But it's also a problem because any existing Python program may be using different tools and they have different interpretations. And so if you adopt somebody's package into your ecosystem, try to run the tool you prefer, it may throw out tons of weird errors and warnings and problems just because it's incompatible with how these things work. Also because they're added late and they're not checked by the Python interpret, it's always kinda more of a hint that it is a requirement. Also, the CPython implementation can't use 'em for performance. And so it's really- - I mean, that's a big one, right? So you can't utilize for the compilation, for the just-in-time compilation, okay. - Yep, yep, exactly. And this all comes back to the design principle of, they're kinda hints, they're kind of, the definition's a little bit murky. It's unclear exactly the interpretation in a bunch of cases. And so because of that, you can't actually, even if you want to, it's really difficult to use them to say, like, it is going to be an int, and if it's not, it's a problem, right? A lot of code would break if you did that, so. So in Mojo, right, so you can still use those kind of type annotations, it's fine. But in Mojo, if you declare a type and you use it, then it means it is going to be that type. And the compiler helps you check that, and enforce it and it's safe and it's not a, like, best-effort hint kind of a thing. - So if you try to shove a string type thing into a integer- - [Chris] You get an error from the compiler. - From the compiler compile time.

And so what Mojo does is it says, okay, well, we can have this notion of structs. So you have classes in Python. Now you can have structs. Classes are dynamic, structs are static. Cool. We can get high performance. We can write C++ kind of code with structs if you want. These things mix and work beautifully together, but what that means is that you can go and implement strings and ints and floats and arrays and all that kinda stuff in the language, right? And so that's really cool because, you know, to me as a idealizing compiler language type of person, what I wanna do is I wanna get magic out of the compiler and put in the libraries. Because if somebody can, you know, if we can build an integer that's beautiful and it has an amazing API and it does all the things you'd expect an integer to do, we don't like it, maybe you want a big integer, maybe you want, like, sideways integer, I don't know, like what all the space of integers are, then you can do that, and it's not a second class citizen. And so if you look at certain other languages, like C++, one I also love and use a lot, int is hardcoded in the language, but complex is not. And so isn't it kinda weird that, you know, you have this STD complex class, but you have int, and complex tries to look like a natural numeric type and things like this. But integers and floating point have these, like, special promotion rules and other things like that, that are magic and they're hacked into the compiler.

Give us six months or a year and I think it'll be way better, but the power of putting in the library means that we can have teams of experts that aren't compiler engineers that can help us design and refine and drive this forward. - So one of the exciting things we should mention here is that this is new and fresh. This cake is unbaked. It's almost baked. You can tell it's delicious, but it's not fully ready to be consumed. - Yep. That's very fair. It is very useful, but it's very useful if you're a super low-level programmer right now. And what we're doing is we're working our way up the stack.

And so in Python, you have a pointer to an array, right? And so you pass that pointer to an array around to things. If you pass into a function, they may take that and scroll away in some other data structure. And so you get your array back and you go to use it. And now somebody else is like putting stuff in your array. How do you reason about that? - Yeah. - It gets to be very complicated and leads to lots of bugs, right? And so one of the things that, you know, again, this is not something Mojo forces on you, but something that Mojo enables is this thing called value semantics. And what value semantics do is they take collections, like array, like dictionaries, also tensors and strings and things like this that are much higher level and make them behave like proper values. And so it makes it look like, if you pass these things around, you get a logical copy of all the data. And so if I pass you an array, it's your array. You can go do what you want to it, you're not gonna hurt my array.",

You have to be careful to implement it in an efficient way. - Yeah, is there a performance hit that's significant? - Generally not if you implement it the right way, but it requires a lot of very low-level getting-the-language-right bits. - I assume that'd be a huge performance hit 'cause the benefit is really nice 'cause you don't get into these- - Absolutely. Well, the trick is you can't do copies. So you have to provide the behavior of copying without doing the copy. - [Lex] Yeah. How do you do that? (Chris laughing) How do you do that? - It's not magic. It's just- - Okay. - It's actually pretty cool. Well, so first, before we talk about how that works, let's talk about how it works in Python, right? So in Python you define a person class, or maybe a person class is a bad idea. You define a database class, right? And a database class has an array of records, something like that, right? And so the problem is, is that if you pass in a record or a class instance into the database, it'll take a hold of that object and then it assumes it has it. And if you're passing an object in, you have to know that that database is gonna take it, and therefore you shouldn't change it after you put it in the database, right? This is- - You just kinda have to know that. - You just have to kinda know that, right? And so you roll out version one of the database. You just kinda have to know that. Of course, Lex uses his own database, right? - [Lex] Yeah. - Right, 'cause you built it, you understand how this works, right? Somebody else joins the team, they don't know this, right? - Yes. - And so now they suddenly get bugs, you're having to maintain the database, you shake your fist, you argue. The 10th time this happens, you're like, okay,",

        "text": "we have to do something different, right? And so what you do is you go change your Python code and you change your database class to copy the record every time you add it. And so what ends up happening is you say, okay, I will do what's called a defensive copy inside the database. And then that way if somebody passes something in, I will have my own copy of it and they can go do whatever and they're not gonna break my thing, (chuckles) okay? This is usually the two design patterns. If you look in PyTorch, for example, this is cloning a tensor. Like, there's a specific thing and you have to know where to call it. And if you don't call it in the right place, you get these bugs and this is state-of-the-art, right? So a different approach, so it's used in many languages, so I've worked with it in Swift, is you say, okay, well, let's provide value semantics. And so we wanna provide the view that you get a logically independent copy, but we wanna do that lazily. And so what what we do is we say, okay, if you pass something into a function, it doesn't actually make a copy. What it actually does is it just increments a reference to it. And if you pass it around, you stick in your database, it can go into the database, you own it. And then you come back outta the stack, nobody's copied anything, you come back outta the stack, and then the caller let's go of it. Well, then you've just handed it off to the database, you've transferred it and there's no copies made. Now, on the other hand, if, you know, your coworker goes and hands you a record and you pass it in, you stick it in the database, and then you go to town and you start modifying it, what happens is you get a copy lazily on demand. And so what this does, this gives you copies only when you need them. So it defines the way the bugs, but it also generally reduces the number of copies in practice. And so it's- - But the implementation details are tricky here, I assume. - Yes, yes. - Something with reference counting, but to make it performant across a number of different kinds of objects?",

The magic is getting the design right so that you can do this in a reasonable way, right? And so there's a number of components that go into this. One is when you're passing around, so we're talking about Python and reference counting and the expense of doing that. When you're passing values around, you don't wanna do extra reference counting for no good reason. And so you have to make sure that you're efficient and you transfer ownership instead of duplicating references and things like that, which is a very low-level problem. You also have to adopt this, and you have to build these data structures. And so if you say, you know, Mojo has to be compatible with Python, so of course the default list is a reference semantic list that works the way you'd expect in Python, but then you have to design a value semantic list. And so you just have to implement that, and then you implement the logic within. And so the role of the language here is to provide all the low-level hooks that allow the author of the type to be able to get and express this behavior without forcing it into all cases or hard coding this into the language itself. - But there's ownership? So you're constantly transferring, you're tracking who owns the thing. - Yes. And so there's a whole system called ownership. And so this is related to work done in the Rust community. Also, the Swift community has done a bunch of work and there's a bunch of different other languages that have all kind of... C++ actually has copy constructors and destructors and things like that. And so, and I mean, C++ has everything. So it has move constructors and has like this whole world of things. And so this is a body of work that's kind of been developing for many, many years now. And so Mojo takes some of the best ideas out of all these systems and then remixes in a nice way so that you get the power of something like the Rust programming language, but you don't have to deal with it when you don't want to,",

Why are they important? How does the value semantics, how does the transfer ownership work with the arguments when they're passing definitions? - Yeah. So if you go deep into systems programming land, so this isn't, again, this is not something for everybody, but if you go deep into systems programming land, what you encounter is you encounter these types that get weird. (chuckles) So if you're used to Python, you think about everything. I can just copy it around. I can go change it and mutate it and do these things and it's all cool. If you get into systems programming land, you get into these things, like, I have an atomic number, or I have a mutex, or I have a uniquely owned database handle, things like this, right? So these types, you can't necessarily copy. Sometimes you can't necessarily even move them to a different address. And so what Mojo allows you to do is it allows you to express, hey, I don't wanna get a copy of this thing. I wanna actually just get a reference to it. And by doing that, what you can say is, you can say, okay, if I'm defining something weird like a, you know, atomic number or something, it's like, it has to be... So an atomic number is an area in memory that multiple threads can access at a time without synchronous, without locks, right? And so, like the definition of atomic numbers, multiple different things have to be poking at that, therefore they have to agree on where it is, (chuckles) right? So you can't just like move it out from underneath one because it kinda breaks what it means. And so that's an example of a type that you can't copy, you can't move it. Like, once you create, it has to be where it was, right? Now, if you look at many other examples, like a database handle, right, so, okay, well, what happens? How do you copy a database handle? Do you copy the whole database? That's not something you necessarily wanna do. There's a lot of types like that where you wanna be able",

So you can say, you can use it, but you don't get to change it. You can pass it by mutable reference. And so if you do that, then you get a reference to it, but you can change it. And so it manages all that kinda stuff. - So it's just a really nice implementation of, like, C++ has- - Yeah. - you know, different kinds of pointers. - Reference, yeah, has pointers. - Smart, smart, different kinds of implementations of smart pointers that you can- - Yeah. - explicitly define, this allows you, but you're saying that's more like the weird case versus the common case? - Well, it depends on where, I mean, I don't think I'm a normal person, so. - Yes. - I mean, I'm not one to call other people weird. - [Lex] Yeah. (Chris chuckling) But, you know, if you talk to a typical Python programmer, you're typically not thinking about this, right? This is a lower level of abstraction. Now, certainly if you talk to a C++ programmer, certainly if you talk to a Rust programmer, again, they're not weird, they're delightful. Like, these are all good people, right? Those folks will think about all the time, right? And so I look at this as, there's a spectrum between very deep, low-level systems, I'm gonna go poke the bits and care about how they're laid out in memory, all the way up to application and scripting and other things like this. And so it's not that anybody's right or wrong, it's about how do we build one system that scales? - By the way, the idea of an atomic number has been something that always brought me deep happiness, because the flip side of that, the idea that threads can just modify stuff",

And you look at what, you know, Moore's law, Moore's Law is this idea that, like computers, for a long time, single thread performance just got faster and faster and faster and faster for free. But then physics and other things intervened, and power consumption, like other things started to matter. And so what ended up happening is we went from single core computers to multi-core, then we went to accelerators, right? And this trend towards specialization of hardware is only gonna continue. And so for years, us programming language nerds and compiler people have been saying, okay, well, how do we tackle multi-core, right? For a while it was like, \"Multi-core is the future. We have to get on top of this thing.\" And then it was multi-core is the default. \"What are we doing with this thing?\" And then it's like, there's chips with hundreds of cores in them. (chuckles) What will happen, right? - Yeah. - And so I'm super inspired by the fact that, you know, in the face of this, you know, those machine learning people invented this idea of a tensor, right? And what's a tensor? A tensor is like an arithmetic and algebraic concept. It's like an abstraction around a gigantic parallelizable dataset, right? And because of that and because of things like TensorFlow and PyTorch, we're able to say, okay, we'll express the math of the system. This enables you to do automatic differentiations, enables you to do like all these cool things. And it's an abstracted representation.

So how do you do this abstraction of distributed Deployment of large models? - Yeah, so one of the really interesting tensions, so there's a whole bunch of stuff that goes into that. I'll pick a random walk through it. If you go back and replay the history of machine learning, right, I mean, the brief, most recent history of machine learning, 'cause this is, as you know, very deep. - [Lex] Yeah. - I knew Lex when he had an AI podcast. - [Lex] Yes.

PyTorch, I think pretty unarguably ended up winning. And why did it win? Mostly because the usability, right? And the usability of PyTorch is I think, huge. And I think, again, that's a huge testament to the power of taking abstract, theoretical technical concepts and bringing it to the masses, right? Now the challenge with what the TensorFlow versus the PyTorch design points was that TensorFlow's kinda difficult to use for researchers, but it was actually pretty good for deployment. PyTorch is really good for researchers. It kind of not super great for deployment, right? And so I think that we as an industry have been struggling. And if you look at what deploying a machine learning model today means is that you'll have researchers who are, I mean, wicked smart, of course, but they're wicked smart at model architecture and data and calculus and (chuckles) like all, like, they're wicked smart in various domains.

And so you throw over the fence, they figure out, okay, it's too slow, won't fit, doesn't use the right operator, the tool crashes, whatever the problem is, then they have to throw it back over the fence. And every time you throw a thing over a fence, it takes three weeks of project managers and meetings and things like this. And so what we've seen today is that getting models in production can take weeks or months. Like, it's not atypical, right? I talk to lots of people and you talk about, like VP of software at some internet company trying to deploy a model, and they're like, why do I need a team of 45 people? (chuckles) Like, it's so easy trying to model. Why can't I deploy it, right? And if you dig into this, every layer is problematic. So if you look at the language piece, I mean, this is tip of the iceberg. It's a very exciting tip of the iceberg for folks, but you've got Python on one side and C++ on the other side. Python doesn't really deploy. I mean, can theoretically, technically in some cases, but often a lot of production teams will wanna get things out of Python because they get better performance and control and whatever else. So Mojo can help with that. If you look at serving, so you talk about gigantic models, well, a gigantic model won't fit on one machine, right? And so now you have this model, it's written Python, it has to be rewritten in C++. Now it also has to be carved up so that half of it runs on one machine, half of it runs on another machine, or maybe it runs on 10 machines.

(chuckles) - Yeah, AlexNet, right, the major breakthrough, and the world has changed, right? And so now the challenge is, is that TensorFlow, PyTorch, these systems, they weren't actually designed for LLMs, like, that was not a thing.

And why is that? Well, it's because, again, these systems have been built up over many years. They haven't been rethought, there hasn't been a first principles approach to this. And so what Modular's doing is we're saying, \"Okay, we've built many of these things, right?\" So I've worked on TensorFlow and TPUs and things like that. Other folks on our team have, like, worked on PyTorch Core. We've worked on ONNX one time. We've worked on many of these other systems.

Get the system to enable one more model. Get this product out the door. Enable the specific workload, or make it solve this problem for this product team, right? And nobody's been given a chance to actually do that step back. And so we, as an industry, we didn't take two steps forward. We took like 18 steps forward in terms of all this really cool technology across compilers and systems and runtimes and heterogeneous computing, like all this kinda stuff.

I mean- - Also it's not just like a handful. - AI's everywhere. Yeah. - It's not a handful of TPU alternatives. It's- - Correct. It's every phone, often with many different chips inside of it- - Right. - from different vendors",

Like, why is everybody making their own thing? - [Chris] Well, so- - Is that a good thing, first of all? - So Chris's philosophy on hardware, right? - Yeah. - So my philosophy is that there isn't one right solution, right? And so I think that, again, we're at the end of Moore's law, specialization happens. - [Lex] Yeah. - If you're building, if you're training GPT-5, you want some crazy super computer data center thingy. If you're making a smart camera that runs on batteries, you want something that looks very different. If you're building a phone, you want something that looks very different. If you have something like a laptop, you want something that looks maybe similar but a different scale, right? And so AI ends up touching all of our lives. Robotics, right? And, like, lots of different things. And so as you look into this, these have different power envelopes. There's different trade-offs in terms of the algorithms. There's new innovations and sparsity and other data formats and things like that. And so hardware innovation, I think, is a really good thing, right? And what I'm interested in is unlocking that innovation. There's also like analog and quantum and like all the really weird stuff, right? - Yeah. - And so if somebody can come up with a chip that uses analog computing and it's 100x more power efficient, think what that would mean in terms of the daily impact on the products we use, that'd be huge. Now, if you're building an analog computer, you may not be a compiler specialist, right? These are different skill sets, right? And so you can hire some compiler people if you're running a big company, maybe, but it turns out these are really like exotic new generation of compilers. (chuckles) Like, this is a different thing, right? So if you take a step back out and come back to what is the status quo, the status quo is that if you're Intel or you're Nvidia,",

And you have a huge team of people that are like trying to keep up and tune and optimize. And even when one of the big guys comes out with a new generation of their chip, they have to go back and rewrite all these things, right? So really it's only powered by having hundreds of people that are all, like, frantically trying to keep up. And what that does is that keeps out the little guys, and sometimes they're not so little guys, the big guys that are also just not in those dominant positions. And so what has been happening, and so you talk about the rise of new exotic, crazy accelerators is people have been trying to turn this from a let's go write lots of special kernels problem into a compiler problem. And so we, and I contributed to this as well, (chuckles) we as an industry went into a like, let's go make this compiler problem phase, let's call it. And much of the industry is still in this phase, by the way. So I wouldn't say this phase is over. And so the idea is to say, look, okay, what a compiler does is it provides a much more general, extensible hackable interface for dealing with the general case, right? And so within machine learning algorithms, for example, people figured out that, hey, if I do a matrix multiplication and I do a ReLU, right, the classic activation function, it is way faster to do one passover the data and then do the ReLU on the output where I'm writing out the data, 'cause ReLU is just a maximum operation, right, max at zero. And so it's an amazing optimization. Take MathML, ReLU. Squished together in one operation, now I have MathML ReLU. Well, wait a second. If I do that, now, I just went from having, you know, two operators to three. But now I figure out, okay, well, there's a lot of activation functions. What about a leaky value? What about... Like, a million things that are out there, right? And so as I start fusing these in, now I get permutations of all these algorithms, right? And so what the compiler people said is they said, \"Hey, well, cool. Well, I will go enumerate all the algorithms and I will enumerate all the pairs",

PyTorch 2's, like, rolling out really cool compiler stuff with Triton, this other technology, and things like this. And so the compiler people are kind of coming into their fore and saying like, Awesome, this is a compiler problem. We'll compiler it. Here's the problem. (chuckles) Not everybody's a compiler person. I love compiler people, trust me, right, but not everybody can or should be a compiler person. It turns out that they're people that know analog computers really well, or they know some GPU internal architecture thing really well, or they know some crazy sparse numeric interesting algorithm that is the cusp of research, but they're not compiler people. And so one of the challenges with this new wave of technology trying to turn everything into a compiler, 'cause again, it has excluded a ton of people. And so you look at what does Mojo do, what does the Modular stack do is brings programmability back into this world. Like, it enables, I wouldn't say normal people, but like a new, you know, a different kind of delightful nerd that cares about numerics, or cares about hardware, or cares about things like this, to be able to express that in the stack and extend the stack without having to actually go hack the compiler itself. - So extend the stack on the algorithm side. - [Chris] Yeah. - And then on the hardware side. - Yeah, so again, go back to, like, the simplest example of int, right? And so what both Swift and Mojo and other things like this did is we said, okay, pull magic out of the compiler and put it in the standard library, right? And so what Modular's doing with the engine that we're providing and like, this very deep technology stack, right, which goes into heterogeneous runtimes and like a whole bunch of really cool, really cool things, this whole stack allows that stack to be extended and hacked and changed by researchers and by hardware innovators and by people who know things that we don't know,",

So what is heterogeneous, right? So heterogeneous just means many different kinds of things together. And so the simplest example you might come up with is a CPU and a GPU. And so it's a simple heterogeneous computer to say, I'll run my data loading and pre-processing and other algorithms on the CPU. And then once I get it into the right shape, I shove it into the GPU. I do a lot of matrix multiplication and convolutions and things like this. And then I get it back out and I do some reductions and summaries and they shove it across the wire, to across the network to another machine, right? And so you've got now what are effectively two computers, a CPU and a GPU talking to each other, working together in a heterogeneous system. But that was 10 years ago, (chuckles) okay? You look at a modern cell phone. Modern cell phone, you've got CPUs, and they're not just CPUs, there's like big.LITTLE CPUs and there's multiple different kinds of CPUs that are kind- - Yep. - of working together, they're multi-core. You've got GPUs, you've got neural network accelerators, you've got dedicated hardware blocks for media, so for video decode and jpeg decode and things like this. And so you've got this massively complicated system, and this isn't just cell phones. Every laptop these days is doing the same thing. And all these blocks can run at the same time and need to be choreographed, right? And so again, one of the cool things about machine learning is it's moving things to like data flow graphs and higher level of abstractions and tensors and these things that it doesn't specify, here's how to do the algorithm. It gives the system a lot more flexibility in terms of how to translate or map it or compile it onto the system that you have. And so what you need, you know, the bottom-est part of the layer there is a way for all these devices to talk to each other. And so this is one thing that, you know,",

And so they're all fully asynchronous. Well, this is actually a small version of the same problem you have in a data center, right? In a data center, you now have multiple different machines, sometimes very specialized, sometimes with GPUs or TPUs in one node and sometimes with disks in other nodes. And so you get a much larger scale heterogenous computer. And so what ends up happening is you have this, like, multi-layer abstraction of hierarchical parallelism, hierarchical, asynchronous communication and making that, again, my enemy, is complexity. By getting that away from being different specialized systems at every different part of the stack and having more consistency and uniformity, I think we can help lift the world and make it much simpler and actually get used. - Well, how do you leverage, like, the strengths of the different specialized systems? So looking inside the smartphone, like there's what, like- - Yeah. - I don't know, five, six computers essentially inside the smartphone? - Yeah. - How do you, without trying to minimize the explicit, making it explicit, which computer is supposed to be used for which operation? - Yeah, so there's a pretty well-known algorithm, and what you're doing is you're looking at two factors. You're looking at the factor of sending data from one thing to another, right, 'cause it takes time to get it from that side of the chip to that side of the chip and things like this. And then you're looking at what is the time it takes to do an operation on a particular block. So take CPUs. CPUs are fully general. They can do anything, right? But then you have a neural net accelerator that's really good at matrix multiplication, okay? And so you say, okay, well, if my workload is all matrix multiplication, I start up, I send the data over the neural net thing, it goes and does matrix multiplication.

And it's not just matrix multiplication. And so what you actually look at is you look at, I have generally a graph of compute. I wanna do a partitioning. I wanna look at the communication, the bisection bandwidth, and like the overhead- - Overheads. - and the sending of all these different things and build a model for this and then decide, okay, it's an optimization problem of where do I wanna place this compute? - So it's the old school theoretical computer science problem of scheduling. - Yep. - And then, presumably it's possible to, somehow, magically include auto-tune into this. - Absolutely, so I mean, in my opinion, this is an opinion, not everybody would agree with this, but in my opinion, the world benefits from simple and predictable systems at the bottom you can control. But then once you have a predictable execution layer, you can build lots of different policies on top of it, right? And so one policy can be that the human programmer says, do that here, do that here, do that here, do that here, and like, fully manually controls everything and the systems should just do it, right? But then you quickly get in the mode of like, I don't wanna have to tell it to do it. (chuckles) - Yeah. - And so the next logical step that people typically take is they write some terrible heuristic. \"Oh, if it's a information location, do it over there. or if it's floating point, do it on the GPU. If it's integer, do it on the CPU,\" like, something like that, right? And then you then get into this mode of like, people care more and more and more, and you say, okay, well, let's actually, like, make the heuristic better. Let's get into auto-tuning. Let's actually do a search of the space to decide, well, what is actually better, right? Well, then you get into this problem where you realize this is not a small space.

And so- - Where does it sit? Where does it live? Is it separate thing or is it part of the compilation? - So you start from simple and predictable models. And so you can have full control and you can have coarse grain knobs that, like, nudge systems so you don't have to do this. But if you really care about getting the best, you know, the last ounce out of a problem, then you can use additional tools. The cool thing is you don't wanna do this every time you run a model. You wanna figure out the right answer and then cache it. (chuckles) And once you do that, you can say, okay, cool. Well, I can get up and running very quickly. I can get good execution out of my system, I can decide if something's important, and if it's important, I can go throw a bunch of machines at it and do a big, expensive search over the space using whatever technique I feel like, it's really up to the problem.

And there's been a lot of people that have been working on the, okay, how do I make Python 2x faster, or 10x faster, or something like that, right? And there've been a ton of projects in that vein, right? Mojo started from the, what can the hardware do? Like, what is the limit of physics? What is the speed of light? - Yeah.

It's like, what can the physics do? - I mean, maybe I'm a special kinda nerd, but you look at that, what is the limit of physics? How fast can these things go, right? When you start looking at that, typically it ends up being a memory problem, right? And so today, particularly with these specialized accelerators, the problem is that you can do a lot of math within them, but you get bottleneck sending data back and forth to memory, whether it be local memory, or distant memory, or disk, or whatever it is. And that bottleneck, particularly as the training sizes get large as you start doing tons of inferences all over the place, like, that becomes a huge bottleneck for people, right? So again, what happened is we went through a phase of many years where people took the special case and hand-tuned it and tweaked it and tricked it out.

And so this is where things like kernel fusion come in. So what is kernel fusion? This is this idea of saying, let's avoid going to memory and let's do that by building a new hybrid kernel and a numerical algorithm that actually keeps things in the accelerator instead of having to write it all the way out to memory, right? What's happened with these accelerators now is you get multiple levels of memory. Like, in a GPU for example, you'll have global memory and local memory, and, like, all these things. If you zoom way into how hardware works, the register file is actually a memory. (chuckles) So the registers are like an L0 cache. And so a lot of taking advantage of the hardware ends up being fully utilizing the full power in all of its capability. And this has a number of problems, right? One of which is again, the complexity of disaster, right? There's too much hardware. Even if you just say let's look at the chips from one line of vendor, like Apple, or Intel, or whatever it is, each version of the chip comes out with new features and they change things so that it takes more time or less to do different things. And you can't rewrite all the software whenever a new chip comes out, right? And so this is where you need a much more scalable approach. And this is what Mojo and what the Modular stack provides is it provides this infrastructure and the system for factoring all this complexity and then allowing people to express algorithms, you talk about auto-tuning, for example, express algorithms in a more portable way so that when a new chip comes out, you don't have to rewrite it all.

And so what that means, what a good stack and what the Modular stack provides is the ability to walk up to it with a new problem and it'll generally work quite well. And that's something that a lot of machine learning infrastructure and tools and technologies don't have. Typical state-of-the-art today is you walk up, particularly if you're deploying, if you walk up with a new model, you try to push it through the converter and the converter crashes, that's crazy. The state of ML tooling today is not anything that a C programmer would ever accept, right?

Then you can say, hey, I have a whole bunch of different... You know, what a multi-core computer is, is it's basically a bunch of computers, right? So they're all independent computers that they can talk to each other and they share memory. And so now what parallelize does, it says, okay, run multiple instances on different computers. And now, they can all work together on Chrome, right? And so what you're doing is you're saying, keep going out to the next level out. And as you do that, how do I take advantage of this? So tiling is a memory optimization, right? It says, okay, let's make sure that we're keeping the data close to the compute part of the problem instead of sending it all back and forth through memory every time I load a block. - And the size of the block, size is, that's how you get to the auto-tune to make sure it's optimized. - Right, yeah.

Can you run Python code as if it's Mojo code? - Yes, yes, (Lex chuckling) and this has two sides of it. So Mojo's not done yet. So I'll give you a disclaimer. Mojo's not done yet, but already we see people that take small pieces of Python code, move it over, they don't change it, and you can get 12x speed ups.

Like, we have to be able to talk to CPython packages, to talk to the CPI, and there's a bunch of pieces to this. - So you have to, I mean, just to make explicit the obvious that may not be so obvious until you think about it.

You can move packages one at a time. - Exactly, but we're not willing to wait for that. (chuckles) Python is too important. The ecosystem is too broad. We wanna both be able to build Mojo out, we also wanna do it the right way without time, like, without intense time pressure. We're obviously moving fast, but. And so what we do is we say, okay, well, let's make it so you can import an arbitrary existing package, arbitrary, including, like, you write your own on your local disk (chuckles) or whatever. It's not like a standard, like an arbitrary package, and import that using CPython because CPython already runs all the packages, right? And so what we do is we built an integration layer where we can actually use Cpython, again, I'm practical, and to actually just load and use all the existing packages as they are. The downside of that is you don't get the benefits of Mojo for those packages, right? And so they'll run as fast, as they do in the traditional CPython way, but what that does is that gives you an incremental migration path.

Well, normally I'd write that in C++. If I can write in Mojo and have one system that scales, well, that's way easier to work with. - Is it hard to do that, to have that layer that's running CPython? Because is there some communication back and forth?",

So it's running its own bike codes, and that's how it provides full compatibility. And then it gives us CPython objects, and we use those objects as is. And so that way we're fully compatible with all the CPython objects and all the, you know, it's not just the Python part, it's also the C packages, the C libraries underneath them, because they're often hybrid. And so we can fully run and we're fully compatible with all that. And the way we do that is that we have to play by their rules, right? And so we keep objects in that representation when they're coming from that world. - What's the representation that's being used? - In memory. We'd have to know a lot about how the CPython interpreter works. It has, for example, reference counting, but also different rules on how to pass pointers around, and things like this, super low-level fiddly. And it's not like Python. It's like how the interpreter works, okay? And so that gets all exposed out, and then you have to define wrappers around the low-level C code, right? And so what this means is you have to know not only C, which is a different role from Python, obviously, not only Python- - [Lex] But the wrappers. - but the interpreter and the wrappers and the implementation details and the conventions. And it's just this reall complicated mess. And when you do that, now suddenly you have a debugger that debugs Python, they can't step into C code, right? So you have this two-world problem, right? And so by pulling this all into Mojo, what you get is you get one world. You get the ability to say, cool, I have un-typed, very dynamic, beautiful, simple code. Okay, I care about performance, for whatever reason, right? There's lots of reasons you might care. And so then you add types, you can parallelize things. You can vectorize things, you can use these techniques, which are general techniques to solve a problem.",

So there's other advantages too. And then you can do that incrementally as you go. - So one different perspective on this would be why Mojo instead of making CPython faster, redesigning CPython. - Yeah, well, I mean, you could argue Mojo is redesigning CPython, but why not make CPython faster and better and other things like that, there's lots of people working on that. So actually there's a team at Microsoft that is really improving... I think CPython 3.11 came out in October or something like that, and it was, you know, 15% faster, 20% faster across the board, which is pretty huge given how mature Python is and things like this. And so that's awesome. I love it. Doesn't run on GPU. (chuckles) It doesn't do AI stuff. Like, it doesn't do vectors, doesn't do things. 20 percent's good. 35,000 times is better, right?

It's actually just, it's goodness for the world, but it's just a different path, right? And again, we're not working forwards from making Python a little bit better. We're working backwards from what is the limit of physics? - What's the process of importing Python code to Mojo? Is there... What's involved in that process? - Yeah. - Is there tooling for that? - Not yet. So we're missing some basic features right now. And so we're continuing to drop out new features, like, on a weekly basis, but, you know, at the fullness of time, give us a year and a half, maybe two years. - Is it an automatable process? - So when we're ready, it'll be very automatable, yes.",

Can you move C code to C++? Yeah, right? - Yes. - And you can move C code to C++, and then you can adopt classes, you can add adopt templates, you can adopt other references or whatever C++ features you want. After you move C code to C++, like, you can't use templates in C, right? And so if you leave it at C, fine. You can't use the cool features, but it still works, right? And C and C++ good work together. And so that's the analogy, right? Now here, right, there's not a Python is bad and Mojo is good, (chuckles) right? Mojo just gives you superpowers, right? And so if you wanna stay with Python, that's cool, but the tooling should be actually very beautiful and simple because we're doing the hard work of defining a superset. - Right. So you're right. So there's several things to say there, but also the conversion tooling should probably give you hints as to, like, how you can improve the code? - Yeah, exactly. Once you're in the new world, then you can build all kinds of cool tools to say like, hey, should you adopt this feature? And we haven't built those tools yet, but I fully expect those tools will exist. And then you can like, you know, quote, unquote, \"modernize your code,\" or however you wanna look at it, right? So I mean one of the things that I think is really interesting about Mojo is that there have been a lot of projects to improve Python over the years. Everything from, you know, getting Python run on the Java virtual machine, PyPy, which is a JIT compiler. There's tons of these projects out there that have been",

There's also another category of these things where they're saying, well, Python is too complicated and, you know, I'm gonna cheat on the edges and at, you know, like integers in Python can be an arbitrary size integer. Like if you care about it fitting in a, going fast in a register in a computer, that's really annoying, right? And so you can choose two pass on that, right? You can say, well, people don't really use big integers that often, therefore I'm gonna just not do it and it'll be fine, not a Python superset. - Yeah. - (chuckles) Or you can do the hard thing and say, okay, this is Python, and you can't be a superset of Python without being a superset of Python. And that's a really hard technical problem, but it's, in my opinion, worth it, right? And it's worth it because it's not about any one package. It's about this ecosystem. It's about what Python means for the world. And it also means we don't wanna repeat the Python 2 to Python 3 transition. Like we want people to be able to adopt this stuff quickly. And so by doing that work, we can help lift people. - Yeah, the challenge, it's really interesting, technical, philosophical challenge of really making a language a superset of another language. It's breaking my brain a little bit. - Well, it paints you into corners. So again, I'm very happy with Python, right? So all joking aside, I think that the indentation thing is not the actual important part of the problem. - [Lex] Yes. (Chris chuckling) - Right? But the fact that Python has amazing dynamic metaprogramming features and they translate to beautiful static metaprogramming features, I think is profound I think that's huge, right?

And so, you know, C++ is way more complicated because of C in the legacy than it would've been if they would've theoretically designed a from scratch thing. And there's lots of people right now that are trying to make C++ better and recent syntax C++, it's gonna be great, we'll just change all the syntax. But if you do that, now suddenly you have zero packages, you don't have compatibility. - If you could just linger on that, what are the biggest challenges of keeping that superset status? What are the things you're struggling with? Does it all boiled down to having a big integer? - No, I mean, it's- - What are the other things like? - Usually it's the long tail weird things. So let me give you a war story. - [Lex] Okay. - So war story in the space is you go away... Back in time, project I worked on is called Clang. Clang, what it is a C++ parser, right? And when I started working on Clang, it must have been like 2006 or something, less, or 2007 something, 2006 when I first started working on it, right?

You know, this is me in earlier times. It's yucky, it's unprincipled, it has all these weird features, like all these bugs, like it's yucky. So I'm gonna build a standard compliant C and C++ parser. It's gonna be beautiful, it'll be amazing, well-engineered, all the cool things an engineer wants to do. And so I started implementing and building it out and building it out and building it out.

At that point, GCC was like over 20 years old, which, by the way- - Yeah. - now, LLVM's over 20 years old, (laughs) right? And so it's funny how- - Yep. - time catches up to you, right? And so you say, okay, well, what is easier, right? I mean, as an engineer, it's actually much easier for me to go implement long tail compatibility weird features, even if they're distasteful and just do the hard work and like figure it out, reverse engineer it, understand what it is, write a bunch of test cases, like, try to understand the behavior. It's way easier to do all that work as an engineer than it is to go talk to all C programmers and argue with them and try to get them to rewrite their code, right? - Yeah. - And- - [Lex] 'Cause that breaks a lot more things. - Yeah. The reality is like nobody actually even understands how the code works 'cause it was written by the person who quit 10 years ago, (chuckles) right? And so this software is kind of frustrating that way, but it's, that's how the world works, right? - Yeah. Unfortunately, it can never be this perfect, beautiful thing. - Well, there are occasions in which you get to build, like, you know, you invent a new data structure or something like that, or there's this beautiful algorithm that's just like, makes you super happy, and I love that moment. But when you're working with people- - Yeah. - and you're working with code and dusty deck code bases and things like this, right, it's not about what's theoretically beautiful, it's about what's practical, what's real, what people will actually use.

What does he think about Mojo? Have you talked to him much about it? - I have talked with him about it. He found it very interesting. We actually talked with before it launched, and so he was aware of it before it went public. I have a ton of respect for Guido for a bunch of different reasons. You talk about walrus operator and, like, Guido's pretty amazing in terms of steering such a huge and diverse community and, like, driving it forward. And I think Python is what it is thanks to him, right? And so to me it was really important starting to work on Mojo to get his feedback and get his input and get his eyes on this, right? Now a lot of what Guido was and is I think concerned about is, how do we not fragment the community? - [Lex] Yeah. - We don't want a Python 2 to Python 3 thing. Like, that was really painful for everybody involved. And so we spent quite a bit of time talking about that. And some of the tricks I learned from Swift, for example, so in the migration from Swift, we managed to, like, not just convert Objective-C into a slightly prettier Objective-C, which we did, we then converted, not entirely, but almost an entire community to a completely different language, right? And so there's a bunch of tricks that you learn along the way that are directly relevant to what we do. And so this is where, for example, you leverage CPython while bringing up the new thing. Like, that approach is, I think, proven and comes from experience. And so Guido's very interested in like, okay, cool. Like, I think that Python is really his legacy, it's his baby.

I think that, again, you would have to ask Guido this, but I think that he was very interested in this notion of like, cool Python gets beaten up for being slow. Maybe there's a path out of that, right? And that, you know, if the future is Python, right, I mean, look at the far outside case on this, right? And I'm not saying this is Guido's perspective, but, you know, there's this path of saying like, okay, well, suddenly Python can suddenly go all the places it's never been able to go before, right? And that means that Python can go even further and can have even more impact on the world. - So in some sense, Mojo could be seen as Python 4.0. - I would not say that. I think that would drive a lot of people really crazy. - Because of the PTSD of the 3.0, 2.0. - I'm willing to annoy people about Emacs versus Vim or- - Not that one. - [Chris] Versus spaces. - Not that one. - I don't know. That might be a little bit far even for me. Like, my skin may not be that thick. - But the point is the step to being a superset and allowing all of these capabilities, I think is the evolution of a language. It feels like an evolution of a language. So he's interested by the ideas that you're playing with, but also concerned about the fragmentation. So what are the ideas you've learned? What are you thinking about? How do we avoid fragmenting the community where the Pythonistas and the, I don't know what to call the Mojo people. - [Chris] Mojicians. - The mojicians, I like it. - [Chris] There you go. - Can coexist happily and share code and basically just have these big code bases that are using Cpython and more and more moving towards Mojo. - Yeah. Yeah. Well, so again, these are lessons I learned from Swift. And here, we face very similar problems, right? In Swift, you have Objective-C, super dynamic.

And so you wanna be able to adopt things piece at a time. And so a thing that I found that worked very well in the Swift community was saying, okay, cool, and this is when Swift was very young, and you say, okay, you have a million line of code Objective-C app. Don't rewrite it all, but when you implement a new feature, go implement that new class using Swift, right? And so now this turns out is a very wonderful thing for an app developer, but it's a huge challenge for the compiler team and the systems people that are implementing this, right? And this comes back to what is this trade-off between doing the hard thing that enables scale versus doing the theoretically pure and ideal thing, right? And so Swift had adopted and built a lot of different machinery to deeply integrate with the Objective-C runtime. And we're doing the same thing with Python right now. What happened in the case of Swift is that Swift's language got more and more and more mature over time, right? And incidentally, Mojo is a much simpler language than Swift in many ways. And so I think that Mojo will develop way faster than Swift for a variety of reasons. But as the language gets more mature and parallel with that, you have new people starting new projects, right? And so if when the language is mature and somebody's starting a new project, that's when they say, okay, cool, I'm not dealing with a million lines of code. I'll just start and use the new thing for my whole stack. Now the problem is, again, you come back to we're communities and we're people that work together. You build new subsystem or a new feature or a new thing in Swift, or you build a new thing in Mojo, then you want it to be end up being used on the other side, (chuckles) right? And so then you need to work on integration back the other way. And so it's not just Mojo talking to Python, it's also Python talking to Mojo, right? And so what I would love to see,",

And if you say, okay, cool, I want to get out of this Python C++ world into a unified world and so I can move to Mojo, but I can't give up all my Python clients 'cause they're like, these levers get used by everybody and they're not all gonna switch every, all, you know, all at once and maybe never, right? Well, so the way we should do that is we should vend Python interfaces to the Mojo types. And that's what we did in Swift and worked great. I mean, it was a huge implementation challenge for the compiler people, right? But there's only a dozen of those compiler people and there are millions of users. And so it's a very expensive, capital-intensive, like, skillset intensive problem. But once you solve that problem, it really helps adoption and it really helps the community progressively adopt technologies. And so I think that this approach will work quite well with the Python and the Mojo world. - So for a package, port it to Mojo, and then create a Python interface. - [Chris] Yep. - So when you're on these packages, NumPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow. - Yeah. - How do they play nicely together? So is Mojo supposed to be... Let's talk about the machine learning ones. Is Mojo kind of visioned to replace PyTorch, TensorFlow to incorporate it? What's the relationship in this? - All right, so take a step back. So I wear many hats. (chuckles) So you're angling it on the Mojo side.

And so when you look at, how does the Modular engine help tens and PyTorch, right, it's not replacing them, right? In fact, when I talk to people, again, they don't like to rewrite all their code. You have people that are using a bunch of PyTorch, a bunch of TensorFlow. They have models that they've been building over the course of many years, right? And when I talk to them, there's a few exceptions, but generally they don't wanna rewrite all their code, right? And so what we're doing is we're saying, \"Okay, well, you don't have to rewrite all your code.\" What happens is the Modular engine goes in there and goes underneath TensorFlow and PyTorch. It's fully compatible and it just provides better performance, better predictability, better tooling. It's a better experience that helps lift TensorFlow and PyTorch and make them even better. I love Python, I love TensorFlow, I love PyTorch, right? This is about making the world better because we need AI to go further. - But if I have a process that trains a model and I have a process that performs inference on that model and I have the model itself, what should I do with that in the long arc of history in terms of if I use PyTorch to train it. Should I rewrite stuff in Mojo if I care about performance? - Oh, so I mean, again, it depends. So if you care about performance, then writing it in Mojo is gonna be way better than writing in Python. But if you look at LLM companies, for example, so you look at Open AI, rumored, and you look at many of the other folks that are working on many of these LLMs and other like innovative machine learning models, on the one hand they're innovating in the data collection and the model, billions of parameters, and the model architecture and the RLHF and the, like all the cool things that people are talking about.

You've designed this programming language, and you've also talked quite a bit about the use of Swift for machine learning context. Why have you decided to move away from maybe an intense focus on Swift for the machine learning context versus sort of designing a new programming language that happens to be a superset? - You're saying this is an irrational set of life choices I make or what?

It was bold and needed and I think, I mean, it's just bold and sometimes to take those leaps, it's a difficult leap to take. - Yeah. Well, so, okay. I mean, I think there's a couple of different things. So actually I left to Apple back in 2017, like January, 2017. So it's been a number of years that I left Apple. And the reason I left Apple was to do AI, okay? So, and again, I won't comment on Apple and AI, but at the time, right, I wanted to get into and understand the technology, understand the applications, the workloads. And so I was like, okay, I'm gonna go dive deep into Applied and AI, and then the technology underneath it, right?

And TPUs are an innovative hardware accelerator platform, have now I mean I think proven massive scale and like done incredible things, right? And so one of the things that this led into is a bunch of different projects, which I'll skip over, right? One of which was this Swift for TensorFlow project, right?

And so the idea of that is say, okay, well, let's look at innovative new programming models where we can get a fast programming language, we can get automatic differentiation into the language. Let's push the boundaries of these things in a research setting, right? Now, that project I think lasted two, three years. There's some really cool outcomes of that. So one of the things that's really interesting is I published a talk at an LLVM conference in 2018, again, this seems like so long ago, about graph program abstraction, which is basically the thing that's in PyTorch 2. And so PyTorch 2 with all this DynamoRIO thing, it's all about this graph program abstraction thing from Python bike codes.

And I think it's super exciting and awesome to see that, but the Swift for TensorFlow project itself did not work out super well. And so there's a couple of different problems with that. One of which is that, you may have noticed, Swift is not Python. (chuckles) There's a few people that write Python code. - [Lex] Yes. - And so it turns out that all of ML is pretty happy with Python. - It's actually a problem that other programming languages have as well, that they're not Python. We'll probably maybe briefly talk about Julia, was a very interesting, beautiful programming language, but it's not Python. - Exactly. And so like if you're saying, I'm gonna solve a machine learning problem",

The world changes and evolves and there's definitely room for new and good ideas, but it just makes it so much harder, right? And so lesson learned, Swift is not Python, and people are not always in search of, like, learning a new thing for the sake of learning a new thing. And if you wanna be compatible with all the world's code, turns out meet the world where it is, right? Second thing is that, you know, a lesson learned is that Swift is a very fast and efficient language, kind of like Mojo, but a different take on it still, really worked well with eager mode. And so eager mode is something that PyTorch does, and it proved out really well, and it enables really expressive and dynamic and easy to debug programming. TensorFlow at the time was not set up for that, let's say. That was not... - [Lex] The timing is also important in this world. - Yeah, yeah. And TensorFlow is a good thing and it has many, many strengths, but you could say Swift for TensorFlow is a good idea, except for the Swift and except for the TensorFlow part. (chuckles) - Swift because it's not Python and TensorFlow because it- - [Chris] It wasn't set up for eager mode at the time, yeah. - It was 1.0. - Exactly. And so one of the things about that is that in the context of it being a research project, I'm very happy with the fact that we built a lot of really cool technology. We learned a lot of things. I think the ideas went on to have influence in other systems, like PyTorch. A few people use that I hear, right? And so I think that's super cool. And for me personally, I learned so much from it, right? And I think a lot of the engineers that worked on it",

I wish it did, of course, right, but, you know, it's a research project. And so you're there to learn from it. - Well, it's interesting to think about the evolution of programming as we come up with these whole new set of algorithms in machine learning, in artificial intelligence. And what's going to win out is it could be a new programming language. It could be- - Yeah. - I mean, I just mentioned Julia. I think there's a lot of ideas behind Julia that Mojo shares. What are your thoughts about Julia in general? - So I will have to say that when we launched Mojo, one of the biggest things I didn't predict was the response from the Julia community. And so I was not, I mean, I've, okay, lemme take a step back. I've known the Julia folks for a really long time. They're an adopter of LLVM a long time ago. They've been pushing state-of-the-art in a bunch of different ways. Julia's a really cool system. I had always thought of Julia as being mostly a scientific computing focused environment, right? And I thought that was its focus. I neglected to understand that one of their missions is to, like, help make Python work end-to-end. (chuckles) And so I think that was my error for not understanding that. And so I could have been maybe more sensitive to that, but there's major differences between what Mojo's doing and what Julia's doing. So as you say, Julia is not Python, right? And so one of the things that a lot of the Julia people came out and said is like, \"Okay, well, if we put a ton of more energy into, ton more money or in engineering or whatever into Julia, maybe that would be better than starting Mojo, right?\" Well, I mean, maybe that's true, but it still wouldn't make Julia into Python. (chuckles) So if you worked backwards from the goal of, let's build something for Python programmers without requiring them to relearn syntax, then Julia just isn't there, right? I mean, that's a different thing, right?",

The syntax isn't broken. Let's take what's great about Python and make it even better. And so it was just a different starting point. So I think Julie's a great language. The community's a lovely community. They're doing really cool stuff, but it's just a different, it's slightly different angle. - But it does seem that Python is quite sticky. Is there some philosophical, almost thing you could say about why Python, by many measures, seems to be the most popular programming language in the world? - Well, I can tell you things I love about it. Maybe that's one way to answer the question, right? So huge package ecosystem, super lightweight and easy to integrate. It has very low startup time, right? - [Lex] So what's startup time? You mean like learning curve or what? - Yeah, so if you look at certain other languages, you say like, go, and it just takes a, like Java, for example, it takes a long time to JIT compile all the things and then the VM starts up and the garbage (indistinct) kicks in and then it revs its engines and then it can plow through a lot of internet stuff or whatever, right? Python is like scripting. Like it just goes, right? - Yeah. - Python has a very low compile time. Like, so you're not sitting there waiting. Python integrates in a notebooks in a very elegant way that makes exploration super interactive and it's awesome, right? Python is also, it's like almost the glue of computing. Because it has such a simple object representation, a lot of things plug into it. That dynamic metaprogramming thing we were talking about, also enables really expressive and beautiful APIs, right? So there's lots of reasons that you can look at, technical things the Python has done and say, like, okay, wow, this is actually a pretty amazing thing.",

And it's growing in importance, right? And so- - And there's a reputation of prestige to machine learning to where like if you're a new programmer, you're thinking about, like, which program and language do I use? Well, I should probably care about machine learning, therefore let me try Python, and kinda builds and builds and builds. - And even go back before that. Like, my kids learned Python, right, not because I'm telling 'em to learn Python, but because- - Were they rebelling against you or what? - Oh, no, no. Well, they they also learn Scratch, right, and things like this too, but it's because Python is taught everywhere, right? Because it's easy to learn, right? And because it's pervasive, right? And there's- - Back in my day, we learned Java and C++. - [Chris] Yeah, well. - Well, uphill both directions, but yes. I guess Python- - Yeah. - is the main language of teaching software engineering schools now. - Yeah, well, and if you look at this, there's these growth cycles, right? If you look at what causes things to become popular and then gain in popularity, there's reinforcing feedback loops and things like this. And I think Python has done, again, the whole community has done a really good job of building those growth loops and help propel the ecosystem. And I think that, again, you look at what you can get done with just a few lines of code, it's amazing. - So this kinda self-building loop is interesting to understand because when you look at Mojo, what it stands for some of the features, it seems sort of clear that this is a good direction",

I think that's gonna be the thing. - Yeah. (Chris chuckling) - Tell the kids that you could use the fire emoji and they'd be like, what? - Exactly, exactly. (Lex chuckling) Well, in all seriousness, like, I mean, I think there's really, I'll give you two opposite answers. One is, I hope if it's useful, if it solves problems, and if people care about those problems being solved, they'll adopt the tech, right? That's kinda the simple answer. And when you're looking to get tech adopted, the question is, is it solving an important problem people need solved, and is the adoption cost low enough that they're willing to make the switch and cut over and do the pain upfront so that they can actually do it, right? And so hopefully Mojo will be that for a bunch of people. And, you know, people building these hybrid packages are suffering. It is really painful. And so I think that we have a good shot of helping people, but the other side is like, it's okay if people don't use Mojo. Like, it's not my job to say like, everybody should do this. Like, I'm not saying Python is bad. Like, I hope Python, CPython, like, all these implementations 'cause Python ecosystems, not just CPython, it's also a bunch of different implementations with different trade-offs. And this ecosystem is really powerful and exciting as are other programming languages. It's not like type script or something is gonna go away, right? And so there's not a winner-take-all thing.

There's the dopamine hit of saying, holy, this is 10 times faster. This little piece of code is 10 times faster in Mojo. - [Chris] Outta the box before you get to 35,000. - Exactly, I mean, just even that, I mean, that's the dopamine hit that every programmer sorta dreams of is the optimization. It's also the drug that can pull you in and have you waste way too much of your life optimizing and over optimizing, right? But so what do you see would be, like, common? It's very hard to predict, of course, but, you know, if you look 10 years from now and Mojo's super successful. - [Chris] Yeah. - What do you think would be the thing where people like try and then use it regularly and it kinda grows and grows and grows and grows? - Well, so you talked about dopamine hit. And so one, again, humans are not one thing. And some people love rewriting their code and learning new things and throwing themselves in the deep end and trying out a new thing. In my experience, most people, they're too busy. They have other things going on. By number, most people don't want like this. I wanna rewrite all my code. But (chuckles) even those people, the two busy people, the people that don't actually care about the language, that just care about getting stuff done, those people do like learning new things, right? - [Lex] Yeah. - And so you talk about the dopamine rush of 10x faster, Wow, that's cool. I wanna do that again. Well, it's also like, here's the thing I've heard about in a different domain, and I don't have to rewrite on my code. I can learn a new trick, right? Well, that's called growth, (chuckles) you know? And so, one thing that I think is cool about Mojo, and again, those will take a little bit of time, for example, the blog posts and the books and, like, all that kinda stuff to develop and the language needs to get further along.

You're not a bad person. (chuckles) If you get really excited about it and wanna go all the way in the deep end and rewrite everything and, like, whatever, that's cool, right? But I think the middle path is actually the more likely one where it's, you know, you come out with a a new idea and you discover, wow, that makes my code way simpler, way more beautiful way, faster way, whatever. And I think that's what people like. Now if you fast forward and you said, like, 10 years out, right, I can give you a very different answer on that, which is, I mean, if you go back and look at what computers looked like 20 years ago, every 18 months, they got faster for free, right, 2x faster every 18 months. It was like clockwork. It was free, right? You go back 10 years ago and we entered in this world where suddenly we had multi-core CPUs and we had, and if you squint and turn your head, what a GPUs is just a many-core, very simple CPU thing kind of, right? And 10 years ago it was CPUs and GPUs and graphics. Today, we have CPU, GPUs, graphics. And AI, because it's so important, because the compute is so demanding because of the smart cameras and the watches and all the different places that AI needs to work in our lives, it's caused this explosion of hardware. And so part of my thesis, part of my belief of where computing goes, if you look out 10 years from now, is it's not gonna get simpler. Physics isn't going back to where we came from. It's only gonna get weirder from here on out, right? And so to me, the exciting part about what we're building is it's about building that universal platform, which the world can continue to get weird. 'Cause again, I don't think it's avoidable, it's physics, but we can help lift people, scale, do things with it, and they don't have to rewrite their code every time a new device comes out.

And we need to be able to get into a mode where we can move this programming model forward, but do so in a way where we're lifting people and growing them instead of forcing them to rewrite all their code and exploding them. - Do you think there'll be a few major libraries that go Mojo first? - Well, so I mean, the Modular engines on Mojo. (chuckles) So again, come back to, like, we're not building Mojo because it's fun. We're building Mojo because we had to solve these accelerators. - That's the origin story, but I mean, ones that are currently in Python. - Yeah, so I think that a number of these projects will. And so one of the things, and again, this is just my best guess. Like, each of the package maintainers also has... I'm sure plenty of other things going on. People really don't like rewriting code just for the sake of rewriting code. But sometimes like people are excited about like adopting a new idea. - Yeah. - And turns out that while rewriting code is generally not people's first thing, turns out that redesigning something while you rewrite it and using a rewrite as an excuse to redesign can lead to the 2.0 of your thing that's way better than the 1.0, right? And so I have no idea, I can't predict that, but there's a lot of these places where, again, if you have a package that is half C and half Python, right, you just solve the pain, make it easier to move things faster, make it easier to bug and evolve your tech adopting Mojo kinda makes sense to start with. And then it gives you this opportunity to rethink these things. - So the two big gains are that there's a performance gain and then there's the portability to all kinds of different devices. - And there's safety, right?

Swift's now 13 years old from when I started it? - [Lex] Yeah. - 'Cause I started in 2010, if I remember.

And it's a mature, successful, used by millions of people system, right? Certainly not dead yet, right? But also going through that story arc, I learned a tremendous amount about building languages, about building compilers, about working with the community and things like this.

And so you look at this LLVM thing that I worked on 20 years ago, and you look at MLIR, right? And so a lot of the lessons learned in LLVM got fed into MLIR, and I think that MLIR is a way better system than LLVM was.

And so what you're doing is you're getting free compute and you're getting to play with this thing in kind of a limited controlled way so that we can make sure that it doesn't totally crash and be embarrassing, right? - Yeah. - So now a lot of the feedback we've gotten is people wanna download it around locally.

I think this is one of the lessons I learned from Swift also, by the way, is when we launched Swift, gosh, it feels like forever ago, it was 2014, and we, I mean, it was super exciting. I, and we, the team had worked on Swift for a number of years in secrecy, okay? And (chuckles) four years into this development, roughly, of working on this thing, at that point, about 250 people at Apple knew about it. - [Lex] Yeah. - Okay? So it was secret.

And so what happened was we went from zero to, you know, I don't know how many developers Apple had at the time, but a lot of developers overnight. And they ran to a lot of bugs and it was really embarrassing and it was very stressful for everybody involved, right? It was also very exciting 'cause everybody was excited about that. The other thing I learned is that when that happened, roughly every software engineer who did not know about the project at Apple, their head exploded when it was launched 'cause they didn't know it was coming. And so they're like, \"Wait, what is this? I signed up to work for Apple because I love Objective-C. Why is there a new thing?,\" right? - Yeah. - And so now what that meant practically is that the push from launch to first of all the fall, but then to 2.0 and 3.0 and like all the way forward was super painful for the engineering team and myself. It was very stressful. The developer community was very grumpy about it because they're like, \"Okay, well, wait a second. You're changing and breaking my code, and like, we have to fix the bugs.\" And it was just like a lot of tension and friction on all sides. There's a lot of technical debt in the compiler because we have to run really fast and you have to go implement the thing and unblock the use case and do the thing. And you know it's not right, but you never have time to go back and do it right. And I'm very proud of the Swift team because they've come, I mean, we, but they came so far and made so much progress over this time since launch, it's pretty incredible.

And so doing it right and not being overwhelmed with technical debt and things like this is like, again, war wounds, lessons learned, whatever you wanna say, I think is absolutely the right thing to do.

He's been pushing- - He's wanted this for years. - Yeah, he's wanted this for a long, long time. - [Chris] He's wanted this for years. And so- - For people who don't know Jeremy Howard, he is like one of the most legit people in the machine learning community. He's a grassroots, he really teaches, he's an incredible educator, he is an incredible teacher,",

And so, I mean, the first time, so I met Jeremy pretty early on, but the first time I sat up and I'm like, this guy is ridiculous, is when I was at Google and we were bringing up TPUs and we had a whole team of people and there was this competition called Don Bench of who can train ImageNet fastest, right? - Yeah. Yes. - And Jeremy and one of his researchers crushed Google (chuckles) by not through sheer force of the amazing amount of compute and the number of TPUs and stuff like that, that he just decided that progressive imagery sizing was the right way to train the model in. You were epoch faster and make the whole thing go vroom, right? - Yep. - And I'm like, \"This guy is incredible.\" So you can say, - Right. anyways, come back to, you know, where's Mojo coming from? Chris finally listened to Jeremy. (Lex laughing) It's all his fault. - Well, there's a kinda very refreshing, pragmatic view that he has about machine learning that I don't know if it, it's like this mix of a desire for efficiency, but ultimately grounded and desired to make machine learning more accessible to a lot of people. I don't know what that is. - Yeah. - I guess that's coupled with efficiency and performance, but it's not just obsessed about performance. - Well, so a lot of AI and AI research ends up being that it has to go fast enough to get scale. So a lot of people don't actually care about performance, particularly on the research side until it allows 'em to have more a bigger dataset, right? And so suddenly now you care about distributed compute and like, all these exotic HPC, like, you don't actually wanna know about that. You just want to be able to do more experiments faster and do so with bigger datasets, right?",

And one of the things I'll say about Jeremy, and there's many things I could say about Jeremy, 'cause I'm a fanboy of his, but it fits in his head, and Jeremy actually takes the time where many people don't to really dive deep into why is the beta parameter of the atom optimizer equal to this, right? - Yeah. - And he'll go survey and understand what are all the activation functions in the trade-offs, and why is it that everybody that does, you know, this model, pick that thing. - So the why, not just trying different values, like, really what is going on here? - Right, and so as a consequence of that, like he's always, he, again, he makes time, but he spends time to understand things at a depth that a lot of people don't. And as you say, he then brings it and teaches people- - [Lex] Teaches it. - And his mission is to help lift, you know, his website says \"making AI uncool again,\" like it's about, like, forget about the hype. It's actually practical and useful. Let's teach people how to do this, right? Now the problem Jeremy struggled with is that he's pushing the envelope, right? Research isn't about doing the thing that is staying on the happy path or the well-paved road, right? And so a lot of the systems today have been these really fragile, fragmented things, are special case in this happy path. And if you fall off the happy path, you get eaten by an alligator. (chuckles) - (chuckles) So what about... So Python has this giant ecosystem of packages and there's a package repository. Do you have ideas of how to do that well for Mojo, how to do a repository of packages well? - So that's another really interesting problem that I knew about but I didn't understand how big of a problem it was: Python packaging. A lot of people have very big pain points and a lot of scars with Python packaging. - Oh, you mean, so there's several things to say. - [Chris] Building and distributing and managing dependencies - Yes. - [Chris] and versioning and all this stuff.",

Now, I'm not an expert in this, so I don't know the answer. I think this is one the reasons why it's great that we work as a team and there's other really good and smart people involved, but one of the things I've heard from smart people who've done a lot of this is that the packaging becomes a huge disaster when you get the Python and C together. And so if you have this problem where you have code split between Python and C, now not only do you have to package the C code, you have to build the C code. C doesn't have a package manager, right? C doesn't have a dependency versioning management system, right? And so I'm not experiencing the state-of-the-art and all the different Python package managers, but my understanding is that's a massive part of the problem. And I think Mojo solves that part of the problem directly heads on. Now, one of the things I think we'll do with the community, and this isn't, again, we're not solving all the world's problems at once, we have to be kinda focused, start with, is that I think that we will have an opportunity to reevaluate packaging, right? And so I think that we can come back and say, okay, well, given the new tools and technologies and the cool things we have that we've built up, because we have not just syntax we have an entirely new compiler stack that works in a new way, maybe there's other innovations we can bring together and maybe we can help solve that problem. - So almost a tangent to that question from the user perspective of packages. It was always surprising to me that it was not easier to sort of explore and find packages, you know, with, with PIP install. It's an incredible ecosystem. It's huge. It's just interesting that it wasn't made. It's still, I think, not made easier to discover packages to do, yeah. like search and discovery as YouTube calls it.",

Like, so there are many people that would have much more informed opinions than I do, but it's interesting, if you look at this, right? Open source communities, you know, there's Git. Git is a fully de decentralized and anybody can do it any way they want, but then there's GitHub, right? And GitHub centralized commercial in that case, right? Thing really helped pull together and help solve some of the discovery problems and help build a more consistent community. And so maybe there's opportunities for- - There's something like a GitHub for- - Yeah. - Although even GitHub, I might be wrong on this, but the search and discovery for GitHub is not that great. Like, I still use Google search. - Yeah, well, I mean, maybe that's because GitHub doesn't wanna replace Google search, right? I think there is room for specialized solutions to specific problems, but sure, I don't know. I don't know the right answer for GitHub either. They can go figure that out. - But the point is to have an interface that's usable, that's successful to people of all different skill levels and- - So, well, and again, like what are the benefit of standards, right? Standards allow you to build these next level-up ecosystem and next level-up infrastructure and next level-up things. And so, again, come back to, I hate complexity, C+ Python is complicated. It makes everything more difficult to deal with. It makes it difficult to port, move code around, work with all these things get more complicated. And so, I mean, I'm not an expert, but maybe Mojo can help a little bit by helping reduce the amount of C in this ecosystem and make it therefore scale better. - So any kinda packages that are hybrid in nature would be a natural fit to move to Mojo, which- - Which is a lot of them, by the way. - Yeah.",

Let me ask you about some features. - Yeah. - So we talked about obviously indentation, that it's a typed language or optionally typed. Is that the right way to say it? - It's either optional or progressively or- - Progressively, okay. - I think the... So people have very strong opinions on the right word to use. - Yeah. - [Chris] I don't know. - I look forward to your letters. So there's the var versus let, but let is for constance. - Yeah. - Var is an optional. - Yeah, var makes it mutable. So you can reassign. - Okay. Then there's function overloading. - Oh okay, yeah. - I mean, there's a lot of source of happiness for me, but function overloading, that's, I guess, is that for performance or is that... Why does Python not have function overloading? - So I can speculate. So Python is a dynamic language. The way it works is that Python and Objective-C are actually very similar worlds if you ignore syntax. And so Objective-C is straight line derived from Smalltalk, a really venerable interesting language that much of the world has forgotten about, but the people that remember it love it generally. And the way that Smalltalk works is that every object has a dictionary in it. And the dictionary maps from the name of a function or the name of a value within an object to its implementation. And so the way you call a method and Objective-C is you say, go look up, the way I call foo is I go look up foo, I get a pointer to the function back, and then I call it, okay, that's how Python works, right? And so now the problem with that is that the dictionary within a Python object, all the keys are strings and it's a dictionary. Yeah. So you can only have one entry per name. You think. - It's as simple as that. - I think it's as simple as that. And so now why do they never fix this? Like, why do they not change it",

    {
        "text": "to not be a dictionary anymore, they not change, like do other things? - Well, you don't really have to in Python because it's dynamic. And so you can say, I get into the function now, if I got past an integer, do some dynamic test for it, if it's a string, go do another thing. There's another additional challenge, which is even if you did support overloading, you're saying, okay, well, here's a version of a function for integers and a function for strings. Well, even if you could put it in that dictionary, you'd have to have the collar do the dispatch. And so every time you call the function, you'd have to say like, is it an integer or is it a string? And so you'd have to figure out where to do that test. And so in a dynamic language, overloading is something you, general, you don't have to have. But now you get into a type language and, you know, in Python, if you subscript with an integer, then you get typically one element out of a collection. If you subscript with a range, you get a different thing out, right? And so often in type languages, you'll wanna be able to express the fact that, cool, I have different behavior, depending on what I actually pass into this thing. And if you can model that, it can make it safer and more predictable and faster, and, like, all these things. - It somehow feels safer, yes, but also feels empowering, like in terms of clarity. Like you don't have to design whole different functions. - Yeah, well, and this is also one of the challenges with the existing Python typing systems is that in practice, like you take subscript, like in practice, a lot of these functions, they don't have one signature, right? They actually have different behavior in different cases. And so this is why it's difficult to like retrofit this into existing Python code and make it play well, with typing. You kinda have to design for that. - Okay, so there's a interesting distinction that people that program Python might be interested in is def versus fn. So it's two different ways to define a function. - Yep. - And fn is a stricter version of def. What's the coolness that comes from the strictness?",

        "text": "- So here you get into, what is the trade-off with the superset? - Yes. - Okay, so superset, you have to, or you really want to be compatible. Like, if you're doing a superset, you've decided compatibility with existing code is the important thing, even if some of the decisions they made were maybe not what you'd choose. - Yeah, okay. - So that means you put a lot of time into compatibility and it means that you get locked into decisions of the past, even if they may not have been a good thing, right? Now, systems programmers typically like to control things, right, and they wanna make sure that, you know, not all cases of course, and even systems programmers are not one thing, right, but often you want predictability. And so one of the things that Python has, for example, as you know, is that if you define a variable, you just say, X equals four, I have a variable name to X. Now I say some long method, some long name equals 17, print out some long name, oops, but I typoed it, right? Well, the compiler, the Python compiler doesn't know in all cases what you're defining and what you're using, and did you typo the use of it or the definition, right? And so for people coming from type languages, again, I'm not saying they're right or wrong, but that drives 'em crazy because they want the compiler to tell them, you type out the name of this thing, right? And so what fn does is it turns on, as you say, it's a strict mode and so it says, okay, well, you have to actually declare, intentionally declare your variables before you use them. That gives you more predictability, more error checking and things like this, but you don't have to use it. And this is a way that Mojo is both compatible 'cause defs work the same way that defs have already always worked, but it provides a new alternative that gives you more control. And it allows certain kinds of people that have a different philosophy to be able to express that and get that. - But usually if you're writing Mojo code from scratch, you'll be using fn. - It depends, again, it depends on your mentality, right?",

Okay. - Well, so control, power. You also like suffering, right? Yes, go hand in hand. - How many pull-ups? - I've lost count at this. Yeah, exactly. At this point. - So, and that's cool. I love you for that. Yeah. And I love other people who like strict things, right, but I don't want to say that that's the right thing because python's also very beautiful for hacking around and doing stuff in research and these other cases where you may not want that. - You see, I just feel like maybe I'm wrong in that, but it feels like strictness leads to faster debugging. So in terms of going from, even on a small project from zero to completion, it just, I guess it depends how many bugs you generate usually. Yeah. - Well, so I mean, if it's again, lessons learned in looking at the ecosystem, it's really, I mean, I think it's, if you study some of these languages over time, like the Ruby community for example, now Ruby is a pretty well, developed, pretty established community, but along their path they really invested in unit testing. Like, so I think that the Ruby community is really pushed forward the state-of-the-art of testing because they didn't have a type system that caught a lot of bugs at compile time, right? And so you can have the best of both worlds. You can have good testing and good types, right, and things like this, but I thought that it was really interesting to see how certain challenges get solved. And in Python, for example, the interactive notebook kind of experiences and stuff like this are really amazing. And if you typo something, it doesn't matter. It just tells you it's fine, right?

And I love you, man, but that is a sign of somebody who likes control. And so, yes. - Yeah. - I think that you'll like f i this turning into a, I think I like Mojo. - Therapy session. Yes. I definitely will. Speaking of asserts exceptions are called errors. Why is it called errors? - So we, I mean, we use the same, we're the same as Python, right, but we implement it a very different way, right? And so if you look at other languages, like we'll pick on C++ our favorite, right? C++ has a thing called zero-cost exception handling, okay? So, and this is in my opinion, something to learn lessons from. - It's a nice polite way of saying it. - And so, zero-cost exception handling, the way it works is that it's called zero-cost because if you don't throw an exception, there's supposed to be no overhead for the non-error code. And so it takes the error path out of the common path. It does this by making throwing an error extremely expensive. And so if you actually throw an error with a C++ compiler using exceptions has to go look up in tables on the side and do all this stuff. And so throwing an error can be like 10,000 times more expensive than referring from a function, right? Also, it's called zero-cost exceptions, but it's not zero-cost by any stretch of the imagination because it massively blows out your code, your binary, it also adds a whole bunch of different paths because of disrupts and other things like that that exist in C++ plus, and it reduces the number of optimizations it has, like all these effects. And so this thing that was called zero-cost exceptions,",

Now if you fast forward to newer languages and this includes Swift and Rust and Go and now Mojo, well, and Python's a little bit different because it's interpreted and so like, it's got a little bit of a different thing going on. But if you look at it, if you look at compiled languages, many newer languages say, okay, well, let's not do that zero-cost exception handling thing. Let's actually treat and throwing an error the same as returning a variant returning either the normal result or an error. Now programmers generally don't want to deal with all the typing machinery and like pushing around a variant. And so you use all the syntax that Python gives us, for example, try and catch and it, you know, functions that raise and things like this. You can put a raises decorator on your functions, stuff like this. And if you wanna control that, and then the language can provide syntax for it. But under the hood, the way the computer executes it, throwing an error is basically as fast as returning something. - Oh, interesting. So it's exactly the same way from a compile perspective. - And so this is actually, I mean, it's a fairly nerdy thing, right, which is why I love it, but this has a huge impact on the way you design your APIs, right? So in C++ huge communities turn off exceptions because the cost is just so high, right? And so the zero-cost cost is so high, right? And so that means you can't actually use exceptions in many libraries, right? Interesting. Yeah. And even for the people that do use it, well, okay, how and when do you wanna pay the cost? If I try to open a file, should I throw an error? Well, what if I'm probing around, looking for something, right, and I'm looking it up in many different paths? Well, if it's really slow to do that, maybe I'll add another function that doesn't throw an error or turns in error code instead. And now I have two different versions of the same thing. And so it causes you to fork your APIs. And so, you know, one of the things I learned from Apple and I so love is the art of API design is actually really profound.",

And so, you know, we wouldn't wanna enter a mode where, you know, there's this theoretical feature that exists in language, but people don't use it in practice. Now I'll also say one of the other really cool things about this implementation approach is that it can run on GPUs and it can run on accelerators and things like this. And that standard zero-cost exception thing would never work on an accelerator. And so this is also part of how Mojo can scale all the way down to like little embedded systems and to running on GPUs and things like that. - Can you actually say about the... Maybe is there some high-level way to describe the challenge of exceptions and how they work in code during compilation? So it's just this idea of percolating up a thing and error. - Yeah, yeah. So the way to think about it is, think about a function that doesn't return anything, just as a simple case, right? And so you have function one calls function two, calls function three, calls function four, along that call stack that are tribe blocks, right? And so if you have function one calls function two, function two has a tribe block, and then within it it calls function three, right? Well, what happens if function three throws? Well, actually start simpler. What happens if it returns? Well, if it returns, it's supposed to go back out and continue executing and then fall off the bottom of the tribe block and keep going and it all's good. If the function throws, you're supposed to exit the current function and then get into the accept clause, right, and then do whatever codes there and then keep falling on and going on. And so the way that a compiler like Mojo works is that the call to that function, which happens in the accept block calls the function, which happens in the accept block calls the function, and then instead of returning nothing, it actually returns, you know, an a variant between nothing and an error. And so if you return, normally fall off the bottom, or do return, you return nothing.",

Is that error thing jump to the accept block. - And that's all done for you behind the scenes. - Exactly. And so the competitor does all this for you. And I mean, one of the things, if you dig into how this stuff works in Python, it gets a little bit more complicated because you have finally blocks, which you need to go into do some stuff, and then those can also throw and return. - Wait, What? Nested? - Yeah, and like the stuff matters for compatibility. Like, there's really- - Can nest them. - there's with clauses, and so with clauses, are kinda like finely blocks with some special stuff going on.

And so they're all these types arithmetic, like, all these tensors and floating point integer and, like, there's this category of of types. And then I can define on an orthogonal access algorithms that then work against types that have those properties. It's been implemented in Swift and Rust in many languages. So it's not Haskell, which is where everybody learns their tricks from, but we need to implement that, and that'll enable a new level of expressivity. - So classes. - Yeah, classes are a big deal. - It's a big deal still to be implemented. Like you said, Lambda syntax, and there's,, like, detailed stuff, like whole module import support for top-level code and file scope. And then global variables also. So being able to have variables outside of a top level. - Well, and so this comes back to the where Mojo came from, and the fact that this is your 0.1, right? So Modular's building an AI stack, right? And an AI stack has a bunch of problems working with hardware and writing high-performance kernels and doing this kernel fusion thing I was talking about, and getting the most out of the hardware. And so we've really prioritized and built Mojo to solve Modular's problem. Right now our North Star is built out to support all the things. And so we're making incredible progress. By the way, Mojo's only, like, seven months old. So that's another interesting thing. - Well, I mean part of the reason I wanted to mention some of these things is like, there's a lot to do and it's pretty cool how you just kinda, sometimes you take for granted how much there is in a programming language, how many cool features you kinda rely on. And this is kinda a nice reminder when you lay it as its do list. - Yeah and so, I mean, but also you look into, it's amazing how much is also there and you take it for granted that a value, if you define it, it will get destroyed automatically. Like, that little feature itself is actually really complicated",

        "text": "given the way the ownership system has to work. And the way that works within Mojo is a huge step forward from what Rust and Swift have done. - Wait, can you say that again? When value- - Yeah. When you define it gets destroyed automatically. - Yeah. So like, like say you have a string, right? So you define a string on the stack. Okay. Or on whatever that means, like in your local function, right? And so you say like whether it be in a def and so you just say X equals hello world, right? Well, if your strength type requires you to allocate memory, then when it's destroyed, you have to deallocate it. So in Python and in Mojo, you define that with a Dell method, right? Where does that get run? Well, it gets run sometime between the last use of the value and the end of the program. Like in this, you now get into garbage collection, you get into, like, all these long debated, you talk about religions and trade-offs and things like this. This is a hugely hotly contested world. If you look at C++, the way this works is that if you define a variable or a set of variables within a function, they get destroyed in a last in, first out order. So it's like nesting, okay. This has a huge problem because if you have a big scope and you define a whole bunch of values at the top and then you use 'em and then you do a whole bunch of code that doesn't use them, they don't get destroyed until the very end of that scope, right? And so this also destroys tail calls. So good functional programming, right? This has a bunch of different impacts on, you know, you talk about reference counting optimizations and things like this. A bunch of very low-level things. And so what Mojo does is it has a different approach on that from any language I'm familiar with, where it destroys them as soon as possible. And by doing that you get better memory use, you get better predictability, you get tail calls that work, you get a bunch of other things, you get better ownership tracking. There's a bunch of these very simple things that are very fundamental that are",

Well, I mean, it's generally trivial. It's after the last use of it. So if you just find X as a string and then you have some use of X somewhere in your code- - Within that scope, you mean, within the scope that is accessible? - It's, yeah, exactly. So you can only use something within its scope. Yeah. And so then it doesn't wait until the end of the scope to delete it, it destroys it after the last use. - So there's kinda some very eager machine that's just sitting there and deleting. Yeah. - And it's all in the compiler. So it's not at runtime, which is also cool. And so interesting. Yeah. And this is actually non-trivial because you have control flow, right? And so it gets complicated pretty quickly. And so like angst, right? Was not, not. - Well, so you have to insert delete, like in a lot of places. - Potentially. Yeah, exactly. So the compiler has to reason about this. And this is where again, it's experience building languages and not getting this right. So again, you get another chance to do it and you get basic things like this, right? But it's extremely powerful when you do that, right? And so there's a bunch of things like that, that kinda combine together. And this comes back to the, you get a chance to do it the right way, do it the right way, and make sure that every brick you put down is really good. So that when you put more bricks on top of it, they stack up to something that's beautiful. - Well, there's also, like, how many design discussions do there have to be about particular details like implementation of particular small features?

        "text": "- Yeah. Well, so I mean, lemme give you another example of this. Python has a feature called async/await. So it's a new feature. I mean, in the long arc of Python history, it's a relatively new feature, right, that allows way more expressive, asynchronous programming. Okay? Again, this is a Python's a beautiful thing. And they did things that are great for Mojo for completely different reasons. The reason that async/await got added to Python, as far as I know, is because Python doesn't support threads, okay? And so Python doesn't support threads, but you wanna work with networking and other things, like, that can block. I mean, Python does support threads, it's just not its strength. And so they added this feature called async/await. It's also seen in other languages like Swift and JavaScript and many other places as well. Async/await and Mojo is amazing 'cause we have a high-performance, heterogeneous compute runtime underneath the covers that then allows non-blocking I/O so you get full use of your accelerator. That's huge. Turns out it's actually really an important part of fully utilizing the machine. You talk about design discussions, that took a lot of discussions, right? And it probably will require more iteration. And so my philosophy with Mojo is that, you know, we have a small team of really good people that are pushing forward and they're very good at the extremely deep knowing how the compiler and runtime and, like, all the low-level stuff works together, but they're not perfect. It's the same thing as the Swift team, right? And this is where one of the reasons we released Mojo much earlier is so we can get feedback and we've already like renamed a keyword data community feedback, which one? We use an ampersand now it's named in out. We're not renaming existing Python keyword 'cause that breaks compatibility, right? We're renaming things. We're adding and making sure that they are designed well. We get usage experience,",

Like do you have a favorite one? - Well, I really, like in terms of humor, like rofl, whatever, rolling on the floor laughing. So that could be like a, what would that be the use case for that? Like an except throw an exception of some sort. I don't- - You should totally file a feature request. - Or maybe a heart one. It has to be a heart one. - People have told me that I'm insane. I'm liking this. - I'm gonna use the viral nature of the internet to get this passed. - I mean, it's funny you come back to the flame emoji file extension, right? You know, we have the option to use the flame emoji, which just even that concept, 'cause for example, the people at GitHub say, now I've seen everything. You know, like. - Yeah, and there's something, it kinda, it's reinvigorating. It's like, oh, that's possible. That's really cool that for some reason that makes everything else, like, seem really excited. - I think the world is ready for this stuff, right? And so, you know, when we have a package manager, we'll clearly have to innovate by having the compiled package thing be the little box with the bow on it, right? I mean, it has to be done. - It has to be done. Is there some stuff on the roadmap that you're particularly stressed about, or excited about that you're thinking about? - A lot, I mean, as of today's snapshot, which will be obsolete tomorrow, the lifetime stuff is really exciting.

The traits feature is really a big deal. And so that's blocking a lot of API design. And so there's that. I think that's really exciting. A lot of it is these kinda table stakes features. One of the things that is again, also lessons learned with Swift is that programmers in general like to add syntactic sugar. And so it's like, oh well, this annoying thing, like in Python, you have to spell Underbar armbar ad. Why can't I just use plus def plus? Come on. Why can't I just do that, right? And so trivial bit of syntactic sugar. It makes sense, it's beautiful, it's obvious. We're trying not to do that. And so for two different reasons, one of which is that, again, lesson learned with Swift. Swift has a lot of syntactic sugar, which may may be a good thing, maybe not, I don't know. But because it's such an easy and addictive thing to do, sugar, like make sure blood get crazy, right? Like, the community will really dig into that and wanna do a lot of that. And I think it's very distracting from building the core abstractions. The second is we wanna be a good member of the Python community, right? And so we wanna work with the broader Python community and yeah, we're pushing forward a bunch of systems programming features and we need to build them out to understand them. But once we get a long ways forward, I wanna make sure that we go back to the Python community and say, okay, let's do some design reviews. Let's actually talk about this stuff. Let's figure out how we want this stuff all to work together. And syntactic sugar just makes all that more complicated. So. - And yeah, list comprehension. Is that yet to be implemented? Yeah.

Maybe one question is how do you hire- - Yeah. - great programmers, great people that operate in this compiler hardware, machine learning, software interface design space? And maybe are- Yeah. - a little bit fluid in what they can do. - So, okay, so language design too. - So building a company is just as interesting in different ways is building a language, like different skill sets, different things, but super interesting. And I've built a lot of teams, a lot of different places. If you zoom in from the big problem into recruiting, well, so here's our problem, okay. I'll be very straightforward about this. We started Modular with a lot of conviction about we understand the problems, we understand the customer pain points. We need to work backwards from the suffering in the industry. And if we solve those problems, we think it'll be useful for people. But the problem is that the people we need to hire, as you say, are all these super specialized people that have jobs at big tech, big tech worlds, right? And, you know, I don't think we have product market fit in the way that a normal startup does, or we don't have product market fit challenges because right now everybody's using AI and so many of them are suffering and they want help. And so again, we started with strong conviction. Now again, you have to hire and recruit the best and the best all have jobs.

Sorry, before we get to the second, what makes for a good culture? - Yeah, so, I mean, there's many different cultures and I have learned many things from many different people, several very unique, almost famously unique cultures. And some of them I learned what to do and some of them I learned what not to do. Yep. Okay. And so we want an inclusive culture. I believe in like amazing people working together. And so I've seen cultures where you have amazing people and they're fighting each other. I see amazing people and they're told what to do, like doubt. Shout line up and do what I say, it doesn't matter if it's the right thing, do it right. And neither of these is the... and I've seen people that have no direction. They're just kinda floating in different places and they wanna be amazing, they just don't know how. And so a lot of it starts with have a clear vision, right? And so we have a clear vision of what we're doing. And so I kind of grew up at Apple in my engineering life, right? And so a lot of the Apple DNA rubbed off on me. My co-founder Tim also is like a strong product guy. And so what we learned is, you know, I saw at Apple that you don't work from building cool technology. You don't work from, like, come up with cool product and think about the features you'll have in the big check boxes and stuff like this. 'Cause if you go talk to customers, they don't actually care about your product, they don't care about your technology. What they care about is their problems, right? And if your product can help solve their problems, well, hey, they might be interested in that, right?

I would refine that to say that there's a hundred not yets for every yes. Yeah. But famously, if you go back to the iPhone, for example, right? iPhone 1, every, I mean, many people laughed at it because it didn't have 3G, it didn't have copy and paste, right? And then a year later, okay, finally it has 3G, but it still doesn't have copy and paste, it's a joke. \"Nobody will ever use this product,\" blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right? Well, year three, had copy and paste, and people stopped talking about it, right? And so, being laser focused and having conviction and understanding what the core problems are and giving the team the space to be able to build the right tech is really important. Also, I mean, you come back to recruiting, you have to pay well, right? So we have to pay industry leading salaries and have good benefits and things like this. That's a big piece. We're a remote-first company. And so we have to... So remote-first has a very strong set of pros and cons. On the one hand, you can hire people from wherever they are, and you can attract amazing talent even if they live in strange places or unusual places. On the other hand, you have time zones. On the other hand, you have, like, everybody on the internet will fight if they don't understand each other. And so we've had to learn how to like have a system where we actually fly people in and we get the whole company together periodically, and then we get work groups together and we plan and execute together. - And there's like an intimacy to the in-person brainstorming.

What I believe in is building well-balanced teams, teams that have people that are different in them. Like if you have all generals and no troops or all troops and no generals, or you have all people that think in one way and not the other way, what you get is you get a very biased and skewed and weird situation where people end up being unhappy.

You know, we do have teams and they're focused on like runtime, or compiler GP, or accelerator, or whatever the specialty is, but people bring a different take and have a different perspective. And I look for people that compliment each other. And particularly if you look at leadership teams and things like this, you don't want everybody thinking the same way. You want people bringing different perspectives and experiences. And so I think that's really important. - That's team. But what about building a company as ambitious as Modular?

It's important, but it's like working on the accounting software for, you know, the retail giant or something, right? It's like enabling infrastructure and technology.

But justifying it and getting a t-shirt, by the way, if you'd like a t-shirt, I can give you a t-shirt. - Well, I would 100% like a t-shirt. Are you joking? - You can have a fire emoji t-shirt.

Yep. That it makes me wonder like how unique my brain is and where the valuable ideas actually come from. Like, how much do I contribute in terms of ingenuity, innovation to code I write or design and that kinda stuff. When you stand on the shoulders of giants, are you really doing anything? And what LLMs are helping you do is they help you stand on the shoulders of giants in your program. There's mistakes. They're interesting that you learn from, but I just, it would love to get your opinion first high level. Yeah. Of what you think about this impact of large language models when they do program synthesis, when they generate code. - Yeah. Well, so I don't know where it all goes. Yeah. I'm an optimist and I'm a human optimist, right? I think that things I've seen are that a lot of the LLMs are really good at crushing leak code projects and they can reverse the link list like crazy. Well, it turns out there's a lot of instances of that on the internet, and it's a pretty stock thing. And so if you want to see standard questions answered, LMS can memorize all the answers, then that can be amazing. And also they do generalize out from that.

It's about understanding the problem. What is the product that you wanna build? What are the use case? What are the customers? You can't just go survey all the customers because they'll tell you that they want a faster horse. Maybe they need a car, right?

When you design new programming language, it almost seems like, man, it would be nice to, this sort of almost as a way to learn how I'm supposed to use this thing for them to be trained on some of the Mojo code. - Yeah. So I do lead an AI company. So maybe there'll be a Mojo LLM at some point. But if your question is like, how do we make a language to be suitable for LLMs? - Yeah. - I think the cool thing about LLMs is you don't have to, right? And so if you look at what is English or any of these other terrible languages that we as humans deal with on a continuous basis, they're never designed for machines and yet they're the intermediate representation. They're the exchange format that we humans use to get stuff done, right? And so these programming languages, they're an intermediate representation between the human and the computer or the human and the compiler, roughly, right? And so I think the LMS will have no problem learning whatever keyword we pick. - Maybe the fire emoji is gonna, oh. - Maybe that's gonna break it. It doesn't tokenize. - No, the reverse of that. It will actually enable it. Because one of the issues I could see with being a superset of Python is there will be confusion about the gray area. So it'll be mixing stuff, but. - Well, I'm a human optimist. I'm also an LM optimist. I think that we'll solve that problem. But you look at that and you say, okay,",

        "text": "well, reducing the rote thing, right? Turns out compilers are very particular and they really want the indentation to be right. They really want the colon to be there on your Els or else it'll complain, right? I mean, compilers can do better at this, but LMS can totally help solve that problem. And so I'm very happy about the new predictive coding and co-pilot type features and things like this, because I think it'll all just make us more productive. - It's still messy and fuzzy and uncertain. Unpredictable. So, but is there a future you see, given how big of a leap GPT-4 was where you start to see something like LMS inside a compiler or no? - I mean, you could do that. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think that would be interesting. - Is that wise? - Well, well, I mean, it would be very expensive. So compilers run fast and they're very efficient and LMS are currently very expensive. There's on-device LLMs and there's other things going on. And so maybe there's an answer there. I think that one of the things that I haven't seen enough of is that, so LLMs to me are amazing when you tap into the creative potential of the hallucinations, right? And so if you're doing creative brainstorming or creative writing or things like that, the hallucinations work in your favor. If you're writing code that has to be correct 'cause you're gonna ship it in production, then maybe that's not actually a feature. And so I think that there has been research and there has been work on building algebraic reasoning systems and kind of like figuring out more things that feel like proofs. And so I think that there could be interesting work in terms of building more reliable at scale systems, and that could be interesting. But if you've chased that rabbit hole down, the question then becomes, how do you express your intent to the machine? And so maybe you want LLLM to provide the spec, but you have a different kind of net that then actually implements the code, right? So it's to use the documentation and inspiration versus the actual implementation. - Yeah. - Potentially. Since if successful Modular will be the thing that runs, I say so jokingly, our AI overlords,",

AGI should be written in Mojo. You're joking, but it's also possible that it's not a joke that a lot of the ideas behind Mojo seems like the natural set of ideas that would enable at scale training and inferences of AI systems. So it's just, I have to ask you about the big philosophical question about human civilization. So folks like Eli Kowski are really concerned about the threat of AI. - Yeah. - Do you think about the good and the bad that can happen at scale deployment of AI systems? - Well, so I've thought a lot about it, and there's a lot of different parts to this problem, everything from job displacement to Skynet, things like this. - Yeah. - And so you can zoom into sub parts of this problem. I'm not super optimistic about AGI being solved next year. I don't think that's gonna happen personally. - So you have a kinda zen-like calm about... There's a nervousness because the leap of GPT-4 seems so big. - Sure, it's huge. - It's like there's some kinda transitionary period. You're thinking- - Well so I mean, there's a couple of things going on there. One is I'm sure GPT-5 and 7 and 19 will be also huge leaps. They're also getting much more expensive to run. And so there may be a limiting function in terms of just expense. On the one hand, train, like, that could be a limiter that slows things down, but I think the bigger limiter outside of, like, Skynet takes over. And I don't spend any time thinking about that, because if Skynet takes over and kills us all, then I'll be dead. So I don't worry about that. So, you know, I mean, that's just, okay. Other things worry about, I'll just focus on. I'll focus and not worry about that one. But I think that the other thing I'd say is that AI moves quickly,",

And so I think that I'm not even too worried about autonomous cars defining away all the taxi drivers. Remember autonomy was supposed to be solved by 2020. Yeah. - Boy, do I remember. - And so like, I think that on the one hand we can see amazing progress, but on the other hand, we can see that, you know, the reality is a little bit more complicated and it may take longer to roll out than you might expect. - Well, that's in the physical space. I do think in the digital spaces, the stuff that's built on top of LLMs that runs, you know, the millions of apps that could be built on top of them, and that could be run on millions of devices, millions of types of devices. - Yeah. - I just think that the rapid effect it has on human civilization could be truly transformative to it. - Yeah. - We don't even know. - Well, and so the predict well, and there I think it depends on, are you an optimist or a pessimist? Or a masochist? - Yeah. Just to clarify optimist about human civilization. - Me too. And so I look at that as saying, okay, cool, well, AI do, right? And so some people say, \"Oh my god. Is it gonna destroy us all? How do we prevent that?\" I kinda look at it from a, is it gonna unlock us all right? You talk about coding, is it gonna make so I don't have to do all the repetitive stuff? Well, suddenly that's a very optimistic way to look at it. And you look at what a lot of these technologies have done to improve our lives, and I want that to go faster. - So what do you think the future of programming looks like in the next 10, 20, 30, 50 years? That alums, LLMs and with Mojo, with Modular, like your vision for devices, the hardware to compilers to this, to the different stacks of software. - Yeah. Yeah.",

        "text": "Well, so what I want, I mean, coming back to my arch nemesis, right? It's complexity, right? So again, me being the optimist, if we drive down complexity, we can make these tools, these technologies, these cool hardware widgets accessible to way more people, right? And so what I'd love to see is more personalized experiences, more things, the research getting into production instead of being lost in (indistinct) right? And so, and like these things that impact people's lives by entering products. And so one of the things that I'm a little bit concerned about is right now the big companies are investing huge amounts of money and are driving the top line of AI capability forward really quickly. But if it means that you have to have $100 million to train a model or more $100 billion, right, well, that's gonna make it very concentrated with very few people in the world that can actually do this stuff. I would much rather see lots of people across the industry be able to participate and use this, right? And you look at this, you know, I mean, a lot of great research has been done in the health world and looking at like detecting pathologies and doing radiology with AI and like doing all these things. Well, the problem today is that to deploy and build these systems, you have to be an expert in radiology and an expert in AI. And if we can break down the barriers so that more people can use AI techniques, and it's more like programming Python, which roughly everybody can do if they want to, right, then I think that we'll get a lot more practical application of these techniques and a lot more nicher cool but narrower demands. And I think that's gonna be really cool. - Do you think we'll have more or less programmers in the world than now? - Well, so I think we'll have more programmers, but they may not consider themselves to be programmers. - That'd be a different name for it, right? I mean, do you consider somebody that uses, you know, I think that arguably the most popular programming language is Excel. - Yeah. - Right? Yep.",

I mean, some of them make crazy macros and stuff like that, but what you mentioned Steve Job is, it's the bicycle for the mind that allows you to go faster, right? And so I think that as we look forward, right? What is AI? I look at it as hopefully a new programming paradigm. It's like object-oriented programming, right? If you wanna write a cat detector, you don't use for loops. Turns out that's not the right tool for the job, right? And so right now, unfortunately, because I mean, it's not unfortunate, but it's just kinda where things are, AI is this weird different thing that's not integrated into programming languages and normal tool chains and all the technology is really weird and doesn't work, right? And you have to babysit it and every time you switch hardware, it's different. It shouldn't be that way. When you change that, when you fix that, suddenly, again, the tools and technologies can be way easier to use. You can start using them for many more things . And so that's what I would be excited about. - What kinda advice could you give to somebody in high school right now or maybe early college who's curious about programming and feeling like the world is changing really quickly here? - Yeah. - Well, what kinda stuff to learn, what kinda stuff to work on? Should they finish college? Should they go work at a company? Should they build a thing? What do you think? - Yeah. Well, so I mean, one of the things I'd say is that you'll be most successful if you work on something you're excited by. And so don't get the book and read the book cover to cover and study and memorize and recite and flashcard and... Go build something. Like, go solve a problem. Go build the thing that you wanted to exist. Go build an app. Go build, train a model. Like, go build something and actually use it, and set a goal for yourself. And if you do that, then you'll, you know, there's a success, there's the adrenaline rush, there's the achievement. There's the unlock that I think is where, you know,",

It's very hard to give generalized advice. I'll speak as you know, a compiler nerd. If everybody's going left, sometimes it's pretty cool to go, right? - Yeah. - And so just because everybody's doing a thing, it doesn't mean you have to do the same thing and follow the herd. In fact, I think that sometimes the most exciting paths through life lead to being curious about things that nobody else actually focuses on, right? And turns out that understanding deeply parts of the problem that people want to take for granted makes you extremely valuable and specialized in ways that the herd is not. And so, again, I mean, there's lots of rooms for specialization, lots of rooms for generalists. There's lots of room for different kinds and parts of the problem, but I think that it's, you know, just because everything everybody's doing one thing doesn't mean you should necessarily do it. - And now the herd is using Python. So if you wanna be a rebel, go check out Mojo and help Chris and the rest of the world fight the arch nemesis of complexity 'cause simple is beautiful. - There we go.
