        "text": "- There's a tremendous amount of good that Neuralink can do in solving critical damage to the brain or the spinal cord. There's a lot that can be done to improve quality of life of individuals, and those will be steps along the way. And then ultimately, it's intended to address the risk, the existential risk, associated with digital super-intelligence. We will not be able to be smarter than a digital super-computer, so therefore, if you cannot beat them, join them. And at least we want to have that option. - So you have hope that Neuralink will be able to be a kind of connection to allow us to merge, to ride the wave of improving AI systems? - I think the chance is above zero percent. - [Lex] So it's non-zero. There's a chance. - Have you seen Dumb and Dumber? - Yes, yes. - [Elon] So I'm saying there's a chance. - You're saying one in a billion, one in a million, whatever it was in Dumb and Dumber. - You know, it went from maybe one in a million to improving, maybe it'll be one in a thousand and then one in a hundred, then one in ten. Depends on the rate of improvement of Neuralink and how fast we're able to make progress. - Well, I've talked to a few folks here and they're quite brilliant engineers, so I'm excited. - It's important that Neuralink solves this problem sooner rather than later, because the point at which we have digital super-intelligence, that's where we pass the Singularity, and things become very uncertain. Doesn't mean that they're necessarily bad or good, but the point at which we pass Singularity, things become extremely unstable. So we want to have a human brain interface before the Singularity, or at least not long after it, to minimize existential risk for humanity and consciousness as we know it.",
