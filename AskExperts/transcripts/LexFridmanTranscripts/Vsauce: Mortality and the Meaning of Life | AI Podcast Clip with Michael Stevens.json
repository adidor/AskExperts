        "text": "so a quick and impossibly deep question last question about mortality you spoken about death as an interesting topic do you think about your own mortality yeah every day it's really scary so what do you think is the meaning of life that mortality makes very explicit so why are you here on earth Michael what's the point of this whole thing what you know what does mortality in in the context of the whole universe make you realize about yourself just you Michael Stevens well it makes me realize that I am destined to become an ocean I'm destined to become a memory and we can extend life I think there's really exciting things being done to extend life but we still don't know how to like you know protect you from some accident that could happen you know some unforeseen thing maybe we could like save my connectome and like recreate my consciousness digitally but even that is could it could be lost if it's stored on a physical medium or something so basically I just think that embracing and realizing how cool it is that like someday I will just be an idea and there won't be a Michael anymore that can be like no that's not what I meant it'll just be what people like they have to guess what I meant and they'll remember me and how I live on and as that memory will will maybe not even be who I wanted to be but there's something powerful about that and there's something powerful about letting future people run the show themselves I think I I'm glad to get out of their way at some point and say all right it's your world now so you the physical entity Michael has have ripple effects in the space of ideas that far out lives you yeah in ways you can't control but nevertheless fascinating to think I mean especially with you you can imagine an alien species when they finally arrive and destroy all of us would watch your videos to try to figure out what what were the questions but even if they",
