        "text": "self-awareness and Anjali will be self-aware yes that's different from consciousness I mean it's me in terms words that what consciousness feels like it feels like consciousness is in a different dimension but this is this could be just an illusion you know if you damnit damage your brain in some way physically you get you you damage your consciousness which it implies that consciousness is a physical phenomenon and in my view the thing is that that I think are really quite quite likely is that digital intelligence will be able to out think us in every way and it will soon be able to simulate what we consider consciousness so to a degree that you would not be able to tell the difference and from the from the aspect of the scientific method it's it might as well be consciousness if we can simulate it perfectly if you can't tell the difference when this is sort of the Turing test but think of a more sort of advanced version of the Turing test if you if you're if you're talking to a digital super intelligence and can't tell if that is a computer or a human like let's say you're just having conversation of a phone or a video conference or something where you're you you think you're talking look looks like a person makes all of the right inflections and movements and and all the small subtleties that constitute a human and talks like human makes mistakes like you're hearing like look at that and you literally just can't tell is this are you really conversing with a person or or an AI might as well might as well be human you",
