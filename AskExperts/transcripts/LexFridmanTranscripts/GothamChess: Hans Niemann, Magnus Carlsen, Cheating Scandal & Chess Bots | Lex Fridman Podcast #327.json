I think so like there's a style to those what uh what's the difference between the way Bots play and the way humans play a lot of people prefer playing Bots because they have anxiety playing other humans it's a very legitimate thing interesting a lot of beginners they don't like live chess they get nervous yellow anxiety you get close to your highest ever rating you panic happens to me too yeah happens to me even now so definitely Bots they're somehow more reliable or something yeah they're I don't know but that's it's a big thing it's a big thing and the popularity of that video shows that people enjoy watching you play chess bots so uh I'm gonna demystify this this might be shocking those Bots are all the same but for the most part you could just program a bot to make mistakes at a certain moment you could program a bot to spend less time on certain moves and it's gotten sophisticated enough that you can basically program it to play at whatever more or less level that a human plays at you say I'll play it at 1800 level so it's programmed to throw in mistakes",

I had quit for like three years and I went to my friend's house and he had a book by Lars gandorf a Danish Grandmaster called the Karo Khan defense which is C6 do you want white do you want black do you want to show them the opening this is the opening the carcon defense so you play E4 I play C6 I have I have to play Black that's it yeah absolutely and we develop from here what counts as a opening okay but the development does the development matter yeah so from here the development goes into the variations of the Karo Khan so this is the Karo Khan like you can be in a city but then you can be in neighborhoods so that's a very non-dramatic okay uh two Pawns in the center so that's called The Briar variation so which what's a good thing for me two two squares yeah if you can put two Pawns in the center yeah you should and then um so that's a good thing yes and then I will go here",
