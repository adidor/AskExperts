And I've never seen a violation of that statement where it's like, yeah, it's mostly good and they're this, and this is like the negotiations. Well, already you're, it's doomed. And that doesn't mean someone has to be perfect, the relationship has to be perfect. But it's gotta feel a hundred percent inside. Like, yes, yes, and yes. - The following is a conversation with my dear friend, Andrew Huberman, his fourth time on this podcast. It's my birthday. So this is a special birthday episode of sorts. Andrew flew down to Austin just to wish me a happy birthday, and we decided to do a podcast last second. We literally talked for hours beforehand and a long time after, late into the night. He's one of my favorite human beings, brilliant scientist, incredible teacher, and a loyal friend. I'm grateful for Andrew. I'm grateful for good friends, for all the support and love I've gotten over the past few years. I'm truly grateful for this life. For the years, the days, the minutes, the seconds I've gotten to live on this beautiful earth of ours. I really don't want to leave just yet. I think I'd really like to stick around. I love you all. This is the \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" And now, dear friends, here's Andrew Huberman. - I'm trying to run a little bit more. - Are you losing weight? - I'm not trying to lose weight, but I always do the same fitness routine after like 30 years, basically, lift three days a week, run three days a week. But one of the runs is a long run, one of 'em is medium, one of 'em is a sprint-type thing. So what I've decided to do this year was just extend the duration for the long run. And I like being a mobile. I never wanna be so heavy that I can't move. Like I wanna be able to go out and run 10 miles if I have to.",

It feels good to train like a lazy bear and just lift heavy objects. But I've also started training with lighter weights and higher repetitions, and for three month cycles, and it gives your joints a rest. And yeah, so probably, you know, I think it also is interesting to see how training differently changes your cognition. That's probably hormone-related, you know, that hormones downstream of training heavy versus hormones downstream of training a little bit lighter. I think my cognition is better when I'm doing more cardio and when the repetition ranges are a little bit higher, which is not to say that people who lift heavy are dumb, but there is a... 'cause there's real value in lifting heavy. - There's a lot of angry people listening to this right now. - No, no, no. But lifting heavy and then taking 3 to 5 minutes rest is far and away a different challenge than running hard for 90 minutes. That's a tough thing. Just like getting in an ice bath, people say, \"Oh, well, how is that any different than working out?\" Well, there are a lot of differences, but one of 'em is that it's very acute stress, within one second you're stressed. So I think subjecting the body to a bunch of different types of stressors in space and time is really valuable. So yeah, I've been playing with the variables in a pre-systematic way. - Well, I like long and slow for, like you said, the impact it has on my cognition. - Yeah, the wordlessness of it, the way it puts you in a, the way it seems to clean out the clutter. You know, it can take away that hyperfocus and put you more in a relaxed focus, for sure. - Well, for me, it brings the clutter to the surface at first. Like, all these thoughts come in there and then they dissipate. You know, I've been, because I got knee barred pretty hard,",

So it's, you know, hyperextend the knee at that direction, they got knee barred pretty hard. So in ways I don't understand, it kinda hurts to run. I don't understand what's happening behind there. I need to investigate this. It basically, this, the hamstringing flex, like curling your leg hurts a little bit. And that results in this weird, dull, but sometimes extremely sharp pain in the back of the knee. So I'm working through this, anyway, but walking doesn't hurt. So I've been playing around with walking recently, like for two hours and thinking- - I love that. - because I know a lot of like smart people throughout history. I have walked and thought, and you have to like, you know, play with things that have worked for others. Not just to exercise, but to like integrate this very light kind of prolonged exercise into a productive life. So they do all their thinking while they walk. It's like a meditative type of walking. And it's really interesting. It really works. - Yeah, the practice I've been doing a lot more of lately is I walk while reading a book, in the yard, I'll just pace back and forth or walk in a circle. - [Lex] Audiobook or are you talking about- - No, hard copy. - [Lex] Well, you're just holding- - I'm holding the book and I'm walking and I'm reading. And I usually have a pen and I'm underlining, I have this whole system, like underlining stars, exclamation points, goes back to university of what things I'll go back to, which things I export to notes and that kind of thing. But from the beginning when I opened my lab at that time in San Diego before I moved back to Stanford, I would have meetings with my students or postdocs by just walking in the field behind the lab, you know, and I'd bring my Bulldog, Costello. Bulldog Masttif at the time. And he was a slow walker. So these were slow walks,",

There's a Nobel Prize winning professor at Columbia University School of Medicine, Richard Axel, who won the Nobel Prize, co-won Nobel Prize with Linda Buck for the discovery of the molecular basis of olfaction. And he walks and voice dictates his papers. And now with Rev or these other, maybe there are better ones than Rev, where you can convert audio files into text very quickly and then edit from there. So I will often voice dictate first drafts and things like that. And I totally agree on the long runs, the walks, the integrating that with cognitive work, harder to do with sprints. And then the gym, you know, are you, you weight train? - Yeah. - You just seem naturally strong and like thicker jointed. - (chuckles) - It's true, it's true. I mean, we did the one very beginner. 'cause I'm a very beginner of jiu-jitsu class together. And yeah, as I mentioned then, what if people missed it? Lex is freakishly strong. - I think I was born genetically to hug people. - [Andrew] Oh, like Costello. - Yeah, exactly. - You guys have a certain similarity. He had wrists, like, you know, it's like you and Jocko and Costello have these like wrists and elbows that are super thick, you know, and then when you look around, you see tremendous variation. You know, some people have like the wrist width of a Whippet or Woody Allen, and then other people like you or Jocko or, you know? There's this one Jocko video or thing on GQ or something. Have you seen the comments on Jocko? These are the best. - [Lex] No. (chuckles) - The comments, I love the comments on YouTube 'cause occasionally they're funny. The best is when Jocko was born, the doctor looked at his parents and said, it's a man. (Lex laughs) - [Lex] It's like Chuck Norris type comments. - Oh yeah, those are great.

In other words, there have been a few times in my life where I did not feel easy about something I felt a signal from my body, this is not good. And I didn't trust it early on, but I knew it was there. And then two or three bad experiences later, I'm able to say, ah, every single time there was a signal from the body informing my mind, \"this is not good.\" Now the reverse has also been true that there've been a number of instances in which I feel there sort of immediate delight. And there's this kind of almost astonishingly simple experience of feeling comfortable with somebody or at peace with something, or delighted at an experience. And it turns out all, literally all of those experiences and people turned out to be experiences and people that are still in my life and that I still delight in every day. In other words, what's great about getting older is that you stop questioning the signals that come from the, I think, deeper recesses of your nervous system to say, Hey, this is not good, or hey, this is great, more of this. Whereas, I think in my teens, my 20s, my 30s, I'm 40, almost 48, I'll be 48 next month. I didn't trust, I didn't listen. I actually put a lot of work into overriding those signals and learning to fight through them, thinking that somehow that was making me tougher or somehow that was making me smarter. When in fact, in the end, those people that you meet that are, you know, difficult or you know, there are other names for it, you know, it's like, in the end you're like, that person's a piece of, you know? Or this person is amazing and they're really wonderful.

Well, it's been mostly guys, but I have some close female friends and always have as well who will tell me that that's a bad decision or this person not so good, or be careful, or they're great, or that's great. So oftentimes my community and the people around me have been more aligned with the correct choice than not- - Christian, really? - Yes - Really? When you were younger, like, or like friends, parents and so on? - I don't recall ever really listening to my parents that much, you know, I grew up in a, you know, we don't have to go back to my childhood thing, but my sense was that- - It's your fault, Andrew. - Thank you, I learned that recently in a psilocybin journey. My first high dose psilocybin journey, which was- - Welcome back. - done with a clinician, thank you very much. Thank you. I was worried there for a second at one point, I might not coming back, but in any event, yeah, I grew up with some wild kids. You know, I would say about a third of my friends from childhood are dead or in jail, about a third have gone on to do tremendously impressive things. Start companies, excellent athletes, academics, scientists and clinicians. And then about a third are living their lives as kind of more typical. I just mean, that they are happy family people with jobs that they mainly serve the function to make money. They're not sort of career into their career for career's sake. But, so some of my friends early on gave me some bad ideas, but most of the time, my bad ideas came from overriding the signals that I knew that my body, and I would say my body and brain were telling me to obey. And now I say body and brain is that there's this brain region, the insula, which does many things, but it represents our sense of internal sensation and interoception.

But Paul's level of insight into the human psyche is absolutely astounding. And he says the opposite of what most people say about the brain, which is most people say, oh, the supercomputer of the brain is the forebrain. It's like a monkey brain with a extra real estate put on there, and the forebrain is what makes us human and gives us our superpowers. Paul has said, and he's done a whole series on mental health that's coming out from our podcast in September. So this is not an attempt to plug that, but he'll elaborate on- - Wait, Paul- - what I'm about to say. - [Lex] Wait, you're doing a thing with Paul with the series? - We already did. Yeah, so Paul- - Oh, nice. - Yeah, so Paul Conti shot, we did, he and I sat down and he did a four episode series on mental health. This is not mental illness, mental health about how to explore one's own subconscious, explore the self build and cultivate the generative drive. You'll learn more about what that is from him. He's far more eloquent and clearer than I am. And he provides essentially a set of steps to explore the self that does not require that you work with a therapist. This is self-exploration that is rooted in psychiatry, it's rooted in neuroscience. And I don't think this information exists anywhere else. I'm not aware that it exists anywhere else. And he essentially distills it all down to one 8 1/2 by 11 sheet, which we provide for people. And he says there, I don't want to give too much away because I would detract from what he does so beautifully, but if I tried and I wouldn't have accomplish it anyway. But he said, \"And I believe that the subconscious is the supercomputer of the brain. All the stuff working underneath our conscious awareness that's driving our feelings and what we think are the decisions that we've thought through so carefully. And that only by exploring the subconscious",

        "text": "and understanding it a little bit, can we actually improve ourselves over time.\" And I agree. I think that, so that the mistake is to think that thinking can override it all. It's a certain style of introspection in thinking that allows us to read the signals from our body, read the signals from our brain, integrate the knowledge that we're collecting about ourselves and to use all that in ways that are really adaptive, and generative for us. - What do you think is there in that subconscious, what do you think of the Jungian shadow, what's there? - You know, there's this idea, as you're familiar with too, I'm sure that this Jungian idea that there, we all have all things inside of us. That all of us have the capacity to be evil, to be good, et cetera, but that some people express one or the other to a greater extent. But he also mentioned that there's a unique category of people, maybe 2 to 5% of people that don't just have all things inside of them, but they actually spend a lot of time exploring a lot of those things. The darker recesses, the shadows, their own shadows. You know, I'm somebody who's drawn to goodness and to light, and to joy, and all those things like anybody else. But yeah, I think maybe it was part of how I grew up. Maybe it was the crowd I was with, maybe... But then again, you know, even when I started spending more time with academics and scientists, I mean, you see shadows in other ways, right? You see pure ambition with no passion. I recall a colleague in San Diego who, it was very clear to me, did not actually care about understanding the brain, but understanding the brain was just his avenue to exercise ambition. And if you gave him something else to work on, he'd work on that, in fact, he did. He left and he worked on something else. I realized he has no passion for understanding the brain, like all, I assumed all scientists do, certainly why I went into it. But some people, it's just raw ambition. It's about winning. It doesn't even matter what they win.",

I think the shadow parts of us are very important to come to understand and look, better to understand them and know that they're there and work with them than to not acknowledge their presence, and have them surface in the form of addictions or behaviors that damage us and other people. - So one of the processes for achieving mental health is to bring those things to the surface. So fish the subconscious mind. - Yes, and you know, Paul describes 10 cupboards that one can look into for exploring the self. There's the structure of self and the function of self. Again, this will all be spelled out in this series in a lot of detail also in terms of its relational aspect between people, how to pick good partners and good relations. It gets really into this from a very different perspective. Yeah, fascinating stuff. I was just sitting there, just... I will say this, that four episode series with Paul is at least to date, the most important work I've ever been involved in, in all of my career. Because it's very clear that we are not taught how to explore our subconscious. And that very few people actually understand how to do that. Even most psychiatrists, he mentioned something about psychiatrists. You know, if you're a cardiothoracic surgeon or something like that and 50% of your patients die, you're considered a bad cardiothoracic surgeon. But with no disrespect to psychiatrists, there are some excellent psychiatrists out there. There are also a lot of terrible psychiatrists out there. Because unless all of those, all of their patients commit suicide or half commit suicide, they can treat for a long time without it becoming visible that they're not so good at their craft. Now he's superb at his craft. And I think he would say that, yes, exploring some shadows, but also just understanding the self. Like what, you know, really understanding like, who am I and what's important? What are my ambitions? What are my strivings?

And as a consequence, they discover what resides in their subconscious through the sometimes bad, hopefully also good, but manifestations of their actions. We are driven by this huge 90% of our real estate that is not visible to our conscious awareness. And we need to understand that, you know, I've talked about this before, I've done therapy twice a week since I was a kid. I had to, as a condition of being let back in school, I continue, I found a way to either through insurance or even when I didn't have insurance, I took an extra job writing for Thrasher Magazine when I was a postdoc so I could pay for therapy at a discount 'cause I didn't make much money as a postdoc. I mean, I think for me, it's as important as going to the gym. And people think it's just, oh, you know, ruminating on problems or getting, no, no, no. If you work with somebody really good, they're forcing you to ask questions about who you really are, what you really want. It's not just about support, but there should be support, there should be rapport, but then it's also, there should be insight, right? Most people who get therapy, they're getting support. There's rapport, but insight is not easy to arrive at. And a really good psychologist or psychiatrist can help you arrive at deep insights that transform your entire life. - Well, sometimes when I look inside, and I do this often, you know, exploring who you truly are, you come to this question, do I accept once you see parts, do I accept this or do I fix this? Is this who you are fundamentally, and it will always be this way? Or is this a problem to be fixed? Like, for example, one of the things, especially recently, but in general over time I've discovered about myself probably has roots in childhood, probably has roots in a lot of things, is I deeply value loyalty maybe more than the average person.

But it spends also on who's disrupting that loyalty, if it's a coworker versus a romantic partner versus your exclusive romantic partner, depending on the structure of your romantic partner life, you know, I mean, I have always experienced extreme joy and feelings of safety, and trust in my friendships. Again, mostly male friendships, but female friendships too, which is only to say that they were mostly male friendships. The female friendships have also been very loyal. You know, so getting backstabbed is not something I'm familiar with. And yeah, I love being crude up, you know? - Yeah, yeah, no, for sure and I'm with you, and you know, you and I are very much have the same values on this, but you know, that's one little thing. And then there's many other things, like I'm extremely self-critical. Then you look at my, you know, I look at myself as, I'm regularly very self-critical, there's a self-critical engine in my brain. And I talked to actually Paul about this, I think on the podcast quite a bit. And he's saying, this is a really bad thing. Like, you need to fix this. You need to be able to be regularly very positive about yourself. And I kept disagreeing with him. No, this is like who I am. And he seems to work, don't mess with a thing that seems to be working, it's fine. Like I oscillate between being really grateful and really self-critical. But then you have to like figure out what is it, maybe there's a deeper root thing. Maybe there's an insecurity in there somewhere that has to do with childhood and then you're trying to prove something to somebody from your childhood, this kind of thing. - Well, a couple things that I think are hopefully valuable for people here.",

So much of our destructive behavior and thinking comes from wanting something that we saw or did, or heard to not be true, rather than really working with that and getting close to what it really was. And you know, sometimes those things are even traumatic and we need to really get close to them and for them to move through us. And that, you know, there are a bunch of different ways to do that with support from others and hopefully, but sometimes on our own as well. I don't think we can rewire our deep preferences and what we find despicable or joyful. I do think that it's really a question of what allows us peace. Like, can you be at peace with the fact that you're very self-critical and enjoy that, get some distance from it, have a sense of humor about it or is it driving you in a way that's keeping you awake at night and forcing you back to the table to do work in a way that feels self-flagellating and doesn't feel good. You know, can you get that humility and awareness of how you're, you know, of your one's flaws? And I think that can create, you know, this word space sounds very new agey, like get space from it. It's, you know, you can have a sense of humor about how, you know, neurotic, we can all be, I mean, you know, neurotic isn't actually a bad term in the classic sense of the psychologists and psychiatrists, the freudians. So that, you know, the best case is to be neurotic, to actually see one's own issues and work with them. Whereas psychotic is the other way to be, which is obviously not good. So I think the question whether or not to work on something or to just accept it as part of ourselves, I think really depends if we feel like it's holding us back or not. And I think you're asking perhaps the most profound question about being a human, which is, you know, what do you do with your body? What do you do with your mind? I mean, it's also a question.",

There's this beautiful, as I mentioned, it seems like every podcast lately, I'm a huge Rancid fan, mostly 'cause I just think Tim Armstrong's writing is pure poetry and whether or not you like the music or not, you know, and he's written music for a lot of other people too. He's not, doesn't advertise that much 'cause he's humble, but- - [Lex] And that by the way, I went to a show of theirs like 20 years ago. - Oh yeah? I'm gonna see them in Boston, September 18th. I'm literally flying there for, or I'll take the train up from New York. I'm gonna meet a friend of mine named Jim Thiebaud, who's a big guy who owns a lot of companies, the skateboard industry. We're meeting there like a couple little kids to go see them play. Amazing people, amazing music. - Very intense. - Very intense, but embodies all the different emotions. That's why I love it, right? They have some love songs, they have some hate songs, they have some, but you know, going back to what you said, I think there's a song, the first song on the Indestructible album, I think there's a, it's sort of, he's just talking about like shock and disbelief of discovering things about people that were close to you, and, you know, I won't sing it, but, you know, nor I wouldn't dare. But there's this one lyric where that's really stuck in my mind for ever since that album came out in 2003, which is, you know, that nothing's what it seems,",

There is this piece of like, you gotta learn how to push out the disturbing stuff sometimes and go forward. And I mean, I remember hearing that lyric and then writing it down and, you know, that was a time where my undergraduate advisor, who was like a mentor and a father to me, you know, blew his head off in the bathtub like three weeks before. And then my graduate advisor, who I was working for at that time, who I loved and adored, was really like a mother to me. I knew her when she was pregnant with her two kids died at 50, breast cancer. And then my postdoc advisor, you know, first day of work at Stanford as a faculty member sitting across the table like this from him, had a heart attack right in front of me, died of pancreatic cancer at the end of 2017. And I remember just thinking like, you know, going back to that song lyric over and over, like, and where people would, you know, I haven't had many betrayals in life. I've had a few, but just thinking like, or seeing something or learning something about something you just, like, you can't believe it. And I mentioned that lyric off that first song, Indestructible on that album because it's this like, just the raw emotion of like, I can't believe this, what I just saw is so disturbing, but I have to just keep going forward. There are certain things that we really do need to push, not just into our periphery, but often to the gutter and keep going. And that's a hard thing to learn how to do. But if you're going to be functional in life, you have to. And actually just to get at this issue of do I change or do I embrace this aspect of self? About six months, it was April of this last year, I did some intense work around some things that were really challenging to me. And I did it alone, and it may have involved some medicine. And I expected to get peace through this. I was like, I'm gonna let go of it, and I spent 11 hours just getting more and more frustrated and angry about this thing that I was trying to resolve. And I was so unbelievably disappointed that I couldn't get that relief. And I was like, what is this?",

        "text": "Like this is not how this is supposed to work. I'm supposed to be feel peace. The clouds are supposed to lift. And so a week went by and then another half week went by, and then someone whose opinion I trust very much, I explained this to them because I was getting a little concerned like, what's going on? This is worse, not better. And they said, \"This is very simple. You have a giant blind spot, which is your sense of justice, Andrew, and your sense of anger are linked like an iron rod and you need to relax it.\" And as they said that, I felt the anger dissipate. And so there was something that I think is, it is true. I have a very strong sense of justice and my sense of anger then at least, was very strongly linked to it. So it's great to have a sense of justice, right? I hate to see people wronged. I absolutely do. And I'm human, I'm sure I've wronged people in my life. I know I have, they've told me, I've tried to apologize and reconcile where possible, still have a lot of work to do. But where I see injustice, it draws in my sense of anger in a way that I think is just eating me up. And, but it was only in hearing that link that I wasn't aware of before, it was in my subconscious, obviously. Did I feel the relaxation? It wasn't, there's no amount of plant medicine or MDMA or any kind of, you know, chemical you can take that's naturally just going to dissipate what's hard for oneself. It needs, if one embraces that or if one chooses to do it through just talk therapy or journaling, or friends, or introspection, or all of the above, there needs to be an awareness of the things that we're just not aware of. So I think the answer to your question, do you embrace or do you fight these aspects of self is, I think you get in your subconscious through good work with somebody skilled or, and sometimes that involves the tools I just mentioned in various combinations, and you figure it out. You figure out if it's serving you. Obviously, it was not bringing me peace.",

Like, you know, when I see somebody wronged, I mean, it used to just like, (puffs) like immediately. - But you're able to step back now that's like to me, the ultimate place to reach is laughter. - I just sit here laughing. Exactly, that's the lyric, I like, I can't believe it. So I just sit here laughing like, can't get distracted. Just you at some point, but the problem I think in just laughing at something, like that gives you distance. But the question is, do you stop engaging with it at that point? Like, I experienced this, I mean, recently, I got to see how sometimes I'll see something that's just like, what? Like this is crazy so I just laugh, but then I continue to engage in it and it's taking me off course. And so there is a place where, you know, I mean, I realize this is probably a kid show too, so I want to keep it, you know, G-rated, but at some point for certain things, it makes sense to go, fuck that. - But also laugh at yourself for saying fuck that. - Yeah, and then move on. So the question is, do you get stuck or do you move on, right? - Sure, but like, there's a lightness of being that comes with laughter. I mean, I've gotten... - Sure. - Like, as you know, I spent the day with Elon today. He just gave me this burnt hair. Do you know what this is? - [Andrew] I have no idea. - I'm sure there's actually, there should be a Huberman lab episode on this.

For those listening, it doesn't quite smell terrible. It's just intense and it stays with you. This to me represents like just laughing at the absurdity of it all. - So I have to ask, so you were rolling jiu-jitsu? - [Lex] Yeah, we're training jiu-jitsu, yeah. - So is that fight between Elon and Zuck actually gonna happen? - I think Elon is a huge believer of this idea of the most entertaining outcomes is the most likely. And he almost like, there's almost the sense that there's not a free will and the universe has a kinda deterministic gravitational field pulling towards the most fun and he's just a player in that game. So from that perspective, I think it seems like something like that is inevitable. - Like a little scrap in the parking lot of a Facebook or something like that. - Exactly. - Sorry, Meta. - Yeah. - But it looks like they're training for real, and Zuck has competed right in jiu-jitsu? - So I think he is approaching it as a sport. Elon is approaching it as a spectacle. And I mean, the way he talks about it, he's a huge fan of history. He talks about all the warriors that have fought throughout history. If you look, he wants to really do it at the Colosseum. And you know, the Colosseum is for 400 years, there's so many, so much great writing about this. I think over 400,000 people have died in the Colosseum, Gladiators. So this is this historic place that sheds so much blood,",

If they bleed, there's one thing's about fighting, you know? I think it was in that book, it's a great book \"Fighter's Heart,\" where he talks about, you know, the sort of the intimacy of sparring. I only rolled jiu-jitsu with you once, but there was a period of time where I boxed and which I don't recommend. I got hit, I hit some guys and definitely got hit back. I'd spar on Wednesday nights when I lived on San Diego. And you know, when you spar with somebody, even if they hurt you, especially if they hurt you, you know, you see that person afterwards and there's an intimacy, right? It was in that book \"Fire's Heart\" where he explains, you know, you're exchanging bodily fluids with a stranger, right? And you're in your primitive mind, and so there's an intimacy there that persists, so. - You go together through a process of fear, anxiety, like- - Yeah, when they get you, you nod. I mean, you watch somebody like catch somebody if, you know, not so much in professional fighting, but if people are sparring that they catch you, you acknowledge that they caught you, like you got me there. - And on the flip side of that, so we trained and then after that we played Diablo IV. - [Andrew] I don't know what that is. I don't play video games, sorry. - But it's a video game. So it's like, it's a, you know, pretty intense combat in the video. You know, you're fighting like demons and- - Oh, okay.

That's a heck of a journey right there of a man. - Yeah, my now friend, Tim Armstrong, like I said, lead singer from Rancid, he put it best.

And just that the arcs of his life are just like sort of an only in America kinda tale too, right? - So, speaking of Shakespeare, I've recently gotten to know Neri Oxman, who's this incredible scientist that works at the intersection of nature and engineering. And she reminded me of this Anna Akhmatova line, this is this great Soviet poet that I really love from over a century ago that, \"Each of our lives is a Shakespearean drama raised to the thousand degree.\" So I have to ask, why do you think humans are attracted to this kind of Shakespearean drama? Is there some aspect we've been talking about the subconscious mind that pulls us towards the drama, even though the place of mental health is peace? - Yes, and yes. - Do you have some of that? - Draw towards drama? Yeah. - [Lex] If you look at the empirical data. - Yes, I mean... Right, if I look at the empirical data, I mean, I think about who I chose to work for",

I mean, I was living in a squad, got into a big fight. I was getting in trouble with the law.

A guy who's an ex-navy guy who smokes cigarettes in the fume hood, drinks coffee, and we're injecting rats with MDMA.

So I'm literally sneaking into the laboratory next door and working for the woman next door because I liked the relationships that she had to a certain set of questions. And she was a kind of a quirky person. And, you know, so drawn to drama, but drawn to, I like characters. I like people that have texture. And I'm not drawn to raw ambition. I'm drawn to people that seem to have a real passion for what they do and a uniqueness to them that I, you know, you can kind of, not kind of, I'll just say how it is. I can feel their heart for what they do. And I'm drawn to that, like... And that can be good. The same reason I went to work for Ben Barres as a postdoc, it wasn't because he was the first transgender member of the National Academy of Sciences. That was just a feature of who he was.

        "text": "This is another thing that Conti makes elaborates on quite a bit more in the series on mental health coming out. But there are different drives within us. There are aggressive drives, not always for fighting, but for intense interaction. I mean, look at Twitter, look at people clearly have an aggressive drive. There's also a pleasure drive. Some people also have a strong pleasure drive. They want to experience pleasure through food, through sex, through friendship, through adventure, you know? But I think the Shakespearean drama is the drama of the different drives in different ratios in different people. I know somebody and she's incredibly kind, has an extremely high pleasure drive, loves taking great care of herself and people around her through food and through retreats, and through all these things, and makes spaces beautiful everywhere she goes. And gifts, these things that are just so unbelievably feminine and incredible. These gifts to people and the kind and thoughtful about what they like. And then, but I would say very little aggressive drive from my read. And then I know other people who are just have a ton of aggressive drive and very little pressure drive. And I think, so there's this alchemy that exists where people have these things in different ratios, and then you blend in, you know, the differences in the chromosomes and differences in hormones, and differences in personal history, and what you end up with is a species that creates incredible recipes of drama, but also peace, also relief from drama, contentment. I mean, I realize this isn't the exact topic of the question, but someone I know very dearly, actually an ex-girlfriend of mine, long-term partner of mine sent me something recently and I think it hit the nail on the head, which is that ideally for a man, they eventually settle where they find and feel peace. Where they feel peaceful, where they can be themselves and feel peaceful. Now, I'm sure there's a equivalent or mirror image of that for women, but this particular post that she sent was about men.",

And so it isn't always that we're seeking friction, but for periods of our life, we seek friction, drama, adventure, excitement, fights, you know, and doing hard, hard things. And then I think at some point, I'm certainly coming to this point now where it's like, yeah, that's all great and checked a lot of boxes, but had a lot of close calls, flew really close to the sun on a lot of things with life and limb, and heart and spirit. And some of, you know, people close to us didn't make it. And sometimes not making it means the career they wanted went off a cliff or their health went off a cliff, or their life went off a cliff. But I think that there's also the Shakespearean drama of the characters that exit the play and are living their lives happily in the backdrop. It just doesn't make for as much entertainment. - That's one other thing that's a benefit, you could say is the benefit of getting older is finding the Shakespearean drama less appealing or finding the joy in the peace. - Yeah, definitely. I mean, I think that, I think there's real peace with age. I think the other thing is this notion of checking boxes is a real thing, for me anyway.

I've started a practice of prayer in the last year, which is new-ish for me, which is, we could talk about it if you want. - In the morning? - Yeah. - Can you talk about it a little bit? - Sure, yeah. And then I have a meditation that I do that actually is where I think through with the different roles that I play. So like, I start very basic. I say, you know, okay, I'm an animal. Like we are like, biologically animals, right?

I have an older sister and I love her tremendously. And I think like, I wanna be the best brother I can be to her.

We always go to New York for our birthdays and we've gone for the last three, four years, like really like reminding myself of that role, not because I'll forget, but because I have all these other roles I'll get pulled into. I say the first one, I'm an animal because I have to remember that I have a body that needs care, like any of us. I need sleep, I need food, I need hydration, I need... That I'm human, that the brain of a human is marvelously complex, but also marvelously self-defeating at times. And so I've been thinking about these things in the context of the different roles. And the whole thing takes about four or five minutes. And I just find it brings me a certain amount of clarity that then allows me to ratchet into the day. The prayer piece, yeah, I think I've been reluctant to talk about until now because I don't believe in pushing religion on people. And I think that, and I'm not. It's a highly individual thing. And I do believe that one can be an atheist and still pray or agnostic and still pray.

It can allow you to get outside yourself, let you give up control, and at the same time take control.\" I don't even like saying take control. But the whole notion is that, and again, forgive me, but there's no other way to say it. The whole notion is that, you know, like God works through us, whatever God is to you, he, him, her, whatever, life force, like nature, whatever it is to you, right? That it works through us. And so I do a prayer, I'll just describe it, where I ask, I make an ask to help remove my defects, my character defects. I pray to God to help remove my character defects so that I can show up better in all the roles of my life and do good work. Like to, which for me is learning and teaching. Learning and teaching. And so you might say, well, how is that different than a meditation? Well, I'm acknowledging that there is something that bigger than me, bigger than nature as I understand it, that I cannot understand or control, nor do I want to. And I'm just giving over to that. And does that make me less of a scientist? I sure as hell hope not. I certainly know, there's the head of our neurosciences at Stanford until recently. You should talk to him directly about it. Bill Newsome has talked about his religious life. For me, it's really a way of getting outside myself and then understanding how I fit into this bigger picture. And the character defects part is real, right? I'm a human, I have defects, like I got a lot of flaws in me, like anybody. But, and trying to acknowledge them and asking for help in removing them, not magically, but through right action, through my right action. So I do that every morning.

I really think so. And it's powerful in a way that all the other stuff, meditation, all the tools is not because it's really operating at a much deeper and bigger level.

And I remember I just, I was like, I don't know if I even have the right to do this, but I'm just praying and I just prayed for the ability to be as brutally honest with myself and with other people as I possibly could be about a particular situation I was in at that time. I mean, I think now it's probably safe to say, I'd gone off to college 'cause of a high school girlfriend. We had, essentially, she was my family, more frankly, more than my biological family was at a certain stage of life. And we'd reached a point where we were diverging and it was incredibly painful. It was like losing everything I had. And it was like, what do I do? How do I manage this? Do I, you know, I was ready to quit and join the fire service just to support us so that we could move forward. And you know, it was just, but praying, just saying, I can't figure this out on my own. It's sort of like I can't figure this out on my own. And how frustrating that is that no number of friends could tell me, or, and in her wisdom couldn't tell me. And eventually, it led me to the right answers. And she and I are are friendly friends to this day. She's happily married with a child and we're on good terms, but I think, you know, it's a scary thing, but it's the best thing when you just, I can't control all this. And asking for help, I think is also the piece. You're not asking for some magic hand to come down and take care of it. You're asking for the help to come through you, right? So that your body is used to do these right works, right action. - Isn't it interesting that this secret thing that you're almost embarrassed by, that you did it as a child is something you, it's another thing you do as you get older, as you realize, like those things are part of you,",

The sunlight viewing and all the rest, you know, a lot of that stuff is just stuff I wish I'd known when I was in graduate school. If I'd known to go outside every once in a while and get some sunlight, not just stay in the lab, I would've, you know, I might not have hit like a really tough round of depression when I was a postdoc and working twice as hard. And, you know, when my body would break down or I'd get sick a lot, I don't get sick much anymore. Occasionally, about once every 18 months to two years maybe I'll get something, but you know, I used to break my foot skateboarding all the time, I couldn't understand what's wrong with my body, I'm getting injured, I can't do what everyone else can. Now I developed more slowly, I had a long arc of puberty, but so that was part of it, I was still developing, but you know, how to get your body stronger, how to build endurance? Like no one told me, the information wasn't there. So a lot of what I put out there is the information that I wish I had because once I had it, I was like, wow! Like A, this stuff really works. B, it's grounded in something real. You know, sometimes certain protocols are a combination of, you know, animal, human, and animal, and human studies, sometimes clinical trials, sometimes there's some mechanistic conjecture for some, not all, I always make clear which. But in the end, like figuring out how things work so that we can be happier, healthier, more productive, suffer less, like reduce the suffering of the world. And I think that, well, I'll just say thank you and for asking about the prayer piece. Again, I'm not pushing or even encouraging it on anyone, I've just found it to be tremendously useful for me. - (sighs) You know, I mean about prayer in general, you said information and figuring out how to get stronger, healthier, smarter, all those kinds of things.

Because when he gets going about the subconscious and the amount of this that sits below the surface like an iceberg and the fact that when we're kids, we're not obscuring a lot of that subconscious as much. And sometimes that can look a little more primitive. I mean, that kid that's disappointed will let you know, that kid that's excited will let you know. And you feel that raw exuberance or that raw dismay. And I think that as we grow older, we learn to cover that stuff up. We wear masks and we have to, to be functional, right? I don't think we all wanna go around just being completely raw. But as you said, as you get older, you also, you get to this point where you kind of go, eh, you know, what are we really trying to protect anyway? I mean, I have this theory that, you know, certainly my experience has taught me that a lot of people, but I'll talk about men 'cause that's what I know best. Whether or not they show up strong or not, that they're really afraid of being weak. Like they're just afraid. Like sometimes the strength is even a way to try and not be weak, right? Which is different than being strong for its own sake. I'm not just talking about physical strength, I'm talking about intellectual strength. I'm talking about money. I'm talking about expressing drive. I've been watching this series a little bit of \"Chimp Empire-\" - Oh, yeah. - So Chimp Empire is amazing, right? They have the head chimp, he's not the head chimp, but the alpha in the group. And he's getting older. And so what does he do? Every once in a while he goes on these vigor displays. He goes and he grabs branch. He starts breaking him and he starts thrashing 'em, and he's incredibly strong, and they're all kind like watching. I mean, yeah, I immediately think of people",

Then there're the ones that are subordinate to him, but not so far behind- - It seems to be that there's a very clear, like numerical ranking. - There is. - Like, it's clear who's the number two, number three? - Oh yeah. - I mean, probably- - Who gets to mate first? Who gets to eat first? This exists in other animal societies too, but Bob Sapolsky would be a great person to talk about this with 'cause he knows obviously, tremendous amount about it. And I know just the top contour, but yeah, so number two, three and four males are aware that he's doing these vigor displays, but they're also aware because in primate evolution they got some extra forebrain too, not as much as us, but they got some, and they're aware that the vigor displays are displays that because they've done them as well in a different context, might not just be displays of vigor, but might also be an insurance policy against people seeing weakness. Okay, so now they start using that prefrontal cortex to do some interesting things. So in primate world, if a male is friendly with another male wants to affiliate with him and say, Hey, I'm backing you, they'll go over and they'll pick off the little parasites and eat them. And so the grooming is extremely important. In fact, if they want to ostracize or kill one of the members of their troop, they will just leave it alone. No one will groom it. And then there's actually a really disturbing sequence in that show of then the parasites start to eat away on their skin. They get infections, they have issues, no one will mate with them, no one, they have other issues as well and can potentially die. So the interesting thing is, is number two and three",

But the current alpha did that to get where he is. So he knows that they're doing this grooming thing, but they might not be sincere about the grooming. So what does he do? He takes the whole troop on a raid to another troop and sees who will fight for him and who won't. This is advanced contracting of behavior for a species that normally we don't think of as sophisticated as us. So it's very interesting and it gets to something that I hope we'll have an opportunity to talk about 'cause it's something that I'm obsessed with lately is this notion of overt versus covert contracts, right? There are overt contracts where you exchange work for money or you exchange any number of things in an overt way. But then there are covert contracts. And those take on a very different form and always lead to, in my belief, bad things. - Well, how much of human and chimp relationships are overt versus covert? - Well, here's one thing that we know is true. Dogs and humans, the dog to human relationship is 100% overt. They don't manipulate you. Now you could say they do in the sense that they learn that if they look a certain way or roll on their back, they get food. But there's no banking of that behavior for a future date where then they're going to undermine you and take your position, okay? So in that sense, dogs can be a little bit manipulative in some sense, but. Now, okay, so overt contract would be, we both wanna do some work together. We're gonna make some money. You get X percentage, I get X percentage, it's overt. Covert contract, which is, in my opinion, always bad would be, we're gonna do some work together. You're gonna get a percentage of money, I'm gonna get a percentage of money, could look just like the overt contract, but secretly, I'm resentful that I got the percentage I got. So what I start doing is covertly taking something else. What do I take? Maybe I take the opportunity to jab you verbally every once in a while. Maybe I take the opportunity to show up late.",

And you see this sometimes in romantic relationships. One person, we won't set the male or female in any direction here and just say, I'll make you feel powerful if you make me feel desired. Okay, great. There's nothing explicitly wrong about that contract if they both know and they both agree, but what if it's, I'll do that, but I'll have kids with you so you feel powerful, you'll have kids with me so I feel desired, but secretly, I don't want to do that. Or one person says, I don't wanna do that or both don't, so what they end up doing is saying, okay, so I expect something else. I expect you to do certain things for me, or I expect you to pay for certain things for me. Covert contracts are the signature of everything bad. Overt contracts are the signature of all things good. And I think about this a lot because I've seen a lot of examples of this. Like anyone, we participate in these things whether or not we want to or not. And the thing that gets transacted the most is, well, I should say the things that get transacted the most are the overt things. You'll see money, time, sex, property, whatever it happens to be, information. But what ends up happening is that when people I believe don't feel safe, they feel threatened in some way, like they don't feel safe in a certain interaction, what they do is they start taking something else while still engaging in the exchange. And I'll tell you, if there's one thing about human nature that's bad, it's that feature. Why that feature? Or is it a bug, or a feature as you engineers like to say, I think it's because we were allocated a certain extra amount of prefrontal cortex that makes us more sophisticated than a dog, more sophisticated than a chimpanzee, but they do it too. And it's because it's often harder to deal with, in the short-term, to deal with the real sense of this is scary,",

So it's a way I think of creating a false sense of certainty, but I'll tell you, covert contracts, the only certainty is that it's gonna end badly. The question is how badly? Conversely, overt contracts always end well. Always, the problem with overt contracts is that you can't be certain that the other person is not engaging in a covert contract. You can only take responsibility for your own contracting. - Well, one of the challenges of being human is looking at another human being and figuring out the way, their way of being, their behavior, which of the two types of contracts it represents because they look awfully the same on the surface. - That's right. - And one of the challenges of being human is the decision we all make is, are you somebody that takes a leap of trust and trust other humans and are willing to take the hurt? Or you going to be cynical and skeptical, and avoid most interactions until they over a long period of time prove your trust. - Yeah, I never liked the phrase history repeats itself when it comes to humans because it doesn't apply if the people or the person is actively working to resolve their own flaws. I do think that if people are willing to do dedicated introspective work, go into their subconscious, do the hard work, have hard conversations, and get better at hard conversations, something that I'm constantly trying to get better at. I think people can change, but they have to want to change. - It does seem like deep down we all can kinda tell the difference between overt and covert. Like we have a good sense.

I won't say which night, but it's the next couple of nights. You know, your circadian clock is one of the most robust features of your biology. I know you can be nocturnal or you can be diurnal. We know you're mostly nocturnal at certain times of the year, Lex, but there're very, very few people can get away with no sleep. Very few people can get away with a chaotic sleep wake schedule. So you have to obey a 24-hour aka circadian rhythm if you wanna remain healthy of mind and body. We also have to acknowledge that it's aging isn't linear, right?

Sort of quality of thought, time spent, physically I can do what I did then, which is probably says more about what I could do then than what I can do now. But if you keep training, you can continue to get better. The key is to not get injured. And I've never trained super hard. I've trained hard, but I've been cautious to not, for instance, weight train more than two days in a row. I do a split, it's basically three days a week and the other days a run, take one full day-off, take a week-off every 12 to 16 weeks.

Unless one is power lifting, you know, weightlifting and running, you can get hurt, but it's not like skateboarding where if you're going for it, you're gonna get hurt. That's just, you're landing on concrete and with jiu-jitsu like people are trying to hurt you so that you say stop. - No, but it- - So with a sport it's different. And these days, I don't really do a sport any longer. I work out, stay fit. I used to continue to do sports, but I kept getting hurt and frankly now, like a rolled ankle, I may put out a little small skateboard part in 2024 because people have been saying we wanna see the kick flip.

I might put out a little part 'cause some of the guys that work on our podcast are from DC, I think by now, I should at least do it just to show like I'm not making it up and I probably will. But I think doing a sport is different. That's how you get hurt, overuse and doing it an actual sport. And so, you know, hat tip to those who do an actual sport. - And that's a difficult decision. Like a lot of people have to make, I have to make with jiu-jitsu for example, like if you just look empirically, I've trained really hard from all my life in grappling sports and fighting sports, and all this kind of stuff. And I've avoided injury for the most part. And I would say, I would attribute that to training a lot. Sounds counterintuitive, but training well and safely, and correctly, keeping good form, saying no when I need to say no, but training a lot and taking it seriously.

I used to have cuttlefish in my lab in San Diego. We went and got them from a guy out in the desert. We put them in the lab, it was amazing. And they had a postdoc who was studying pre-capturing cuttlefish, they have a very ballistic, extremely rapid strike and grab of the shrimp.

And if the shrimp was facing them, they would do this thing with their tentacles of kind of enchanting the shrimp, and if the shrimp wasn't facing them, they wouldn't do it and they would ballistically grab it and eat them. Well, when we got these new shrimp, the new shrimp had eye spots on their tails. And then the cuttlefish would do this kind of attempt to enchant regardless of the position of the ghost shrimp. So what does that mean? Okay, well, it means that there's some sort of algorithm in the cuttlefish's mind that says, okay, if you see two spots, move your tentacles. So it can be, as you pointed out, it can be a fairly simple operation, but it looks diabolical. It looks cunning, but all it is, is strategy B. - Yeah, but it's still somehow emerged. I mean, I don't think that calling it an algorithm doesn't, I feel like- - Well, there's a circuit there that gets implemented in a certain context, but that circuit had to evolve. - You do realize a super intelligent AI will look at us humans and we'll say the exact thing. There's a circuit in there that evolved to do this algorithm A and algorithm B. And it's trivial. And to us humans, it's fancy and beautiful and write poetry about it, but it's just surreal. - Because so we don't understand the subconscious because they want that AI algorithm cannot see into what it can't see. It doesn't understand the under workings of what allows all of this conversation stuff to manifest.",

Maybe your AI friend or coach, like I think Andreessen and others are arguing it's gonna happen at some point it's gonna say, Hey, you know, Lex, you're making decisions lately that are not good for you, but it's because of this algorithm that you picked up in childhood that if you don't state your explicit needs upfront, you're not gonna get what you want, so why do it? From now on, you need to actually make a list of every, absolutely, outrageous thing that you want no matter how outrageous and communicate that immediately. And that will work. - We're talking about cuttlefish and sexual selection, and then we went into some, where do we go? And you said you were excited. - Well, I was excited where you were just saying what about these covert contracts and animals do them, I think is simple contextual engagement of a neural circuit, which is not just nerd speak for saying they do a different strategy. It's saying that there has to be a circuit there, hardwired circuit, maybe learned, but probably hardwired that can be engaged, right? You can't build neural machinery out of, in a moment, you need to build that circuit over time. What is building it over time? You select for it. The cuttlefish that did not have that alternate context-driven circuit, didn't survive when there was a, when all the shrimp that they normally disappear in the, the eye-spotted shrimp showed up and there were a couple that had some miswiring, this is why mutation, right? X-Men type stuff is real. They had a mutation that had some alternate wiring and that wiring got selected for, it became a mutation that was adaptive as opposed to maladaptive. This is something people don't often understand about genetics is that it only takes a few generations to devolve a trait, make it worse, but it takes a long time to evolve an adaptive trait.

But doesn't take long to devolve adaptive traits so that you're getting sicker or you're not functioning as well. So choose your mate wisely. And that's perhaps a good segue into sexual selection of humans. - I could tell you're good at this. (Andrew chuckling) We said why did I bring up sexual selection? It's relationships, so sexual selection in humans. I don't think you've done an episode on relationships. - No, I did an episode on attachment, but not on relationships. The series with Conti includes one episode of the four that's all about relational understanding and how to select a mate based on matching of drives and- - All the demons inside the subconscious? How to match demons that they dance well together or what? - And how generative two people are. - [Lex] What does that mean? - Means that how, the way he explains it is, how devoted to creating growth within the context of the family, the relationship with work. - Well, lemme ask you about mating rituals and how to find such a relationship? I mean, you're really big on friendships, on the value of friendships. - I am. - And that I think extends itself into one of the deepest kinds of friendships you can have, which is a romantic relationship. What mistakes, successes and wisdom can you impart? - Well, I've certainly made some mistakes. I've also made some good choices in this realm. First of all, we have to define what sort of relationship we're talking about. If one is looking for a life partner, you know, potentially somebody to establish family with, with or without kids, with or without pets, right? Families can take different forms. I mean, I certainly experienced being a family in a prior relationship where it was the two of us and our two dogs. And it was like, it was family.",

I must say, I've got friends who are in long-term, monogamous, very happy relationships where there seems to be a lot of love, a lot of laughter, a lot of challenge and a lot of growth. And both people it seems really want to be there and enjoy being there. - Just to pause on that, one thing to do, I think, by way of advice is listen to people who are in long-term successful relationships. That's like, it seems dumb, but like we both know and are friends with Joe Rogan, who's been in a long-term, really great relationship and he's been an inspiration to me. So you take advice from that guy? - Definitely. And several members of my podcast team are in excellent relationships. I think one of the things that rings true over and over again in the advice and in my experience is, you know, find someone who's really a great friend. Like build a really great friendship with that person. Now, obviously, not just a friend if we're talking romantic relationship, but, and of course, sex is super important, but it should be a part of that particular relationship alongside or meshed with the friendship. Can it be a majority of the positive exchange? I suppose it could, but I think the friendship piece is extremely important because what's required in a successful relationship clearly is joy in being together. Trust, a desire to share experience both, you know, mundane and more adventurous, support each other, acceptance, a real, maybe even admiration, but certainly delight in being with the person. You know, earlier we were talking about peace, and I think that that sense of peace comes from knowing that the person you're in friendship with or that you're in romantic relationship or ideally both 'cause let's assume healthy relation, the best romantic relationship includes a friendship component with that person. It's like you just really delight in their presence, even if it's a quiet presence",

The trust piece is huge, you know, and that's where people start, you know, we don't wanna focus on what works, not what doesn't work, but that's where I think people start engaging these covert contracts. They're afraid of being betrayed, so they betray. They're afraid of giving up too much vulnerability so they hide their vulnerability or in the worst cases, they feign vulnerability. Again, that's a covert contract that just simply undermines everything, it becomes one, both one equals two minus one to infinity. Conversely, I think if people can have really hard conversations, this is something I've had to work really hard on in recent years that I'm still working hard on, but the friendship piece seems to be the thing that rises to the top when I talk to friends who are in these great relationships. It's like they have so much respect and love, and joy in being with their friend. It's the person that they wanna spend as much of their non-working, non-platonic friendship time with and the person they want to experience things with, and share things with. And it sounds so kinda canned and cliche nowadays, but I think if you step back and examine how most people go about finding a relationship, sort of like, oh, like am I attracted, of course, physical attraction is important and other forms of attraction too, and they sort of enter through that portal, which makes sense. That's the mating dance, right? That's the peacock situation. That's hopefully not the cuttlefish situation where the, (chuckles) but I think that there seems to be a history of people close to me getting into great relationships where they were friends for a while first or maybe didn't sleep together right away. That they actually intentionally deferred on that. This has not been my habit or my experience, you know, I've gone the more I think typical like, oh, there's an attraction like this person, there's an interest, you kinda explore all dimensions of relationship really quickly,",

But I think, the whole take it slow thing, I don't think is about getting to know someone slowly. I think it's about that physical piece because that does change the nature of the relationship. And I think it's because it gets right into the more hardwired primitive circuitry around our feelings of safety, vulnerability, you know, there's something about romantic and sexual interactions where it's almost like, it's like assets and liabilities, right? Where people are trying to figure out how much to engage their time and their energy, in multiple people, I'm talking about from both sides, you know, male, female or whatever it sides, but where it's like assets and liabilities, and that's where it starts getting into those complicated contracts early on, I think. And so maybe that's why if a really great friendship and admiration is established first, even if people are romantically and sexually attracted to one another, then that piece can be added in a little bit later in a way that really kinda just seals up the whole thing. And then who knows, maybe they spend 90% of their time having sex, I don't know, that's not for me to say or decide, obviously. But there's something there about staying out of a certain amount of risk of having to engage covert contract in order to protect oneself. - But I do think like, love at first sight, this kind of idea is in part realizing very quickly that you are great friends. Like I've had that experience of friendship recently. It's not really friendship, but like, oh, you get each other, with humans, not in a romantic setting. - Right, friendship. - Yeah, just friendship, but not- - Well, but dare I say, I felt that way about you when we met, right? - But we also- - I was like, this dude's cool and he's smart, and he's funny, and he's driven, and he's giving, and he's got an edge, and like, I wanna learn from him, wanna hang out with him.

'Cause they had a wonderful boy, they want a girl. Is there a way to control the gender? - Well, this has been debated for a long time and I did a four and a half hour episode on fertility. And the reason I did a four and a half hour episode on fertility is that, first of all, I find it that reproductive biology be fascinating. And I wanted a resource for people that were thinking about or struggling with having kids for whatever reason. And it felt important to me to combine the male and female components in the same episode. It's all timestamped, so you don't have to listen to the whole thing. We talk about IVF, in vitro fertilization and we talk about natural pregnancy. Okay, the data on position is very interesting. But let me just say a few things. There are a few clinics now in particular, some out of the United States that are spinning down sperm and finding that they can separate out fractions as they're called, you know, that can spin the sperm down at a given speed and they'll separate out at different sort of depths within the test tube that allow them to pull out the sperm on top or below and bias the probability towards male or female births. It's not perfect. It's not a hundred percent. It's a very costly procedure. It's still very controversial. Now with in vitro fertilization, you can extract eggs, you can do introduce a sperm directly by pipette and it's a process called ICSI or you can set up a sperm race in a dish. And if you get a number of different embryos, meaning the eggs get fertilized to duplicate and start form a blastocyst, which is a ball of cells, early embryo, then you can do karyotyping. So you can do, look for XX or XY, select the XY, which then would give rise to a male offspring and implant that one. So there is that kind of sex selection.

So for instance, if it's ejaculation during intermission, during sex penetration, et cetera, then you can't measure, for instance, sperm volume as opposed to when it's IVF, and they can actually measure how many milliliters, how many forward motile sperm, it's hard to control for certain things. And it just can vary between individuals and even from one ejaculation to the next. And, okay, so there's too many variables. However, the position thing is interesting in the following way. And then I'll answer whether or not you can bias towards a female. But as long as we're talking about sexual- - [Lex] I have other questions about sexual- - But as long as we're talking about sexual position. There are data that support the idea that in order to increase the probability of successful fertilization, that indeed the woman should not stand upright after sex and should right after the man has ejaculated inside her and should adjust her pelvis, say 15 degrees upwards. I mean, you know, some of the fertility experts, MDs will say, that's crazy, you know, but others that I sought out, and not specifically for this answer, but for researching that episode, said that, yeah, you know what? You're talking about is trying to get the maximum number of sperm and it's contained in semen and yes, the semen can leak out. And so keeping the pelvis tilted for about at 15 degrees for about 15 minutes, obviously, tilted in the direction that would have things running upstream, not downstream, so to speak. - Yeah, gravity. - Gravity, it's real,",

Okay, so then with respect to female getting a female offspring or XX, female offspring, selectively, there is the idea that as fathers get older, they're more likely to have daughters as opposed to sons. That's a, from the papers I've read is a significant, but still mildly significant result. So with each passing year, this person increases the probability they're gonna have a daughter, not a son. But look, so that's interesting. - But the probability differences are probably tiny as you- - I mean, it's not, you know, it's not trivial, it's not a trivial difference. But if they want to ensure having a daughter, then they should do IVF and select an XX embryo. And when you go through IVF, they genetically screen them for karyotype, which is XX, XY. And they look at mutations, genotypic mutations for things like, you know, trisomies and aneuploidies, all the stuff you don't want. - But there is a lot of lore if you look on the internet. - Sure, different foods- - [Lex] So there are a lot of variables- - There's a lot of variable, but there haven't been systematic studies. So I think probably the best thing to do, unless they're gonna do IVF is just, you know, roll the dice and you know, and I think with each passing year they increase the probability of getting a female offspring, but of course, with each passing year, the egg and sperm quality degrade, so, you know, get after it soon. - So I went down a rabbit hole.

She does these really like dry, like scientific presentation, but very nice. She has a lovely voice and she, but she'll be talking about, you know, erections or squirting, or like all this, like she does like very kind of internet type content, but she's a legitimate urologist, reproductive health expert.

One interesting factoid is that only three, only 3% of sexual dysfunction is hormonal endocrine in nature. It's more often related to some pelvic floor or vasculature blood flow related, or other issue. And then when Eisenberg, he came on the podcast, he said that far less sexual dysfunction is psychogenic in origin than people believe that far more of it is pelvic floor, neuro and vascular. So, you know, there are the myths of, I mean, it's not saying that psychogenic dysfunction doesn't exist, but that a lot of sexual dysfunction that people assume is related to hormones or that is related to psychogenic issues are related to vascular or neural issues. And the good news is that there are great remedies for those. And so both those episodes detail some of the more salient points around what those remedies are and could be, I mean, one of the kind of, again, factoids, but it was interesting that, you know, a lot of people have pelvic floor issues and they think that their pelvic floors are quote-unquote, \"messed up.\" So they go on the internet, they learn about Kegels, you know, and it turns out that some people need Kegels, they need to strengthen their pelvic floor, guess what?",

And in many ways, the neural innervation of the two, while clearly different, has some overlapping features that you know, that there's gonna be discussion around kind of anatomy and hormones, and pelvic floors, and in a way that's gonna, you know, erode some of the kind of like cloaking of these topics 'cause they've been cloaked for a long time and there's a lot of like, well, let's just call it what it is, there's a lot of bullshit out there about what's what.

But yeah, you're always concerned that people either won't get it or I won't be clear.

So much so that if I wake up and I don't feel rested enough, I'll often do a non-sleep deep rest, yoga nidra,",

I think a little bit of anxiety and a little bit of concern about deadline helps. Turning the phone off helps. Realizing that those peak hours, whenever they are for you, you do not allow those hours to be invaded unless there's a, you know, a nuclear bomb goes off. And a nuclear bomb is just a, you know, a phraseology for, you know, it could be family crisis, would be, you know, would be good justification if there's an emergency, obviously. But it's all about focus. It's all about focus in the moment. It's not even so much about how many hours you log. It's really about focus in the moment. How much total focus can you give to something? And then I like to take walks and think about things and sometimes talk about them in my voice recorder. So I'm just always churning on it all the time. And then of course, learning to turn it off and engage with people socially and, you know, not be podcasting 24 hours a day in your head is key. But I think I love learning and researching, and finding that those papers and the information, and I love teaching it. And these days I use a whiteboard before I start. I don't have any notes, no teleprompter. Then the whiteboard that I used beforehand is to really sculpt out the different elements and the flow, get the flow right, and move things around. The whiteboard is such a valuable tool. Then take a couple pictures of that when I'm happy with it, put it down on the desk and these are just bullet points and then just churn through, and just churn through. And nothing feels better than, you know, researching and sharing information. And as you did, you know, grew up writing papers and it's hard. And I like the friction of a, (grunts) can't, you know, I wanna get up, wanna use the bathroom. When I was in college, I was trying to make up deficiencies from my lack of attendance in high school.

There's something about the human brain that likes these kind of friction points and working through them and you just have to work through them. So yeah, I'm productive and my life has arranged around it and you know, that's been a bit of a barrier to personal life at times, but my life's been arranged around it. I've set up everything so that I can learn more, teach more, including, you know, some of my home life. But I do, you know, still watch Chimp Empire. Still got time to watch Chimp Empire.

Yeah, I've also struggled finishing projects that are new, that are something new. Like for example, one of the things I really struggled finishing is something that's in Russian that requires translation and overdub, and all that kind of stuff. The other project I've been working on for like, over at least a year, off and on, but trying to finish is something we've talked about in the past is, I'm still on it project on Hitler and World War II. I've written so much about it and I just don't know why I can't finish it. I have trouble, like really... I think I'm terrified being in front of the camera. - Like this? - Like this. - Or solo? - Well, actually, no, no, no. Solo, basically. - Well, if you wanna do solo and seriously, 'cause we've done this before, right? Our clandestine study missions. I'm happy to sit in the corner and work on my book or do something if you wanna, if it feels good- - Just for the feeling of somebody else. - Definitely. - What do you, I mean, how do you... You don't seem to, you seem to have been fearless, to just sit in front of the camera by yourself to do the episode. - Yeah, it was weird. I mean, the first year of the podcast, it just spilled outta me. It was just, I had all that stuff I was so excited about. I've been talking to everyone and who would listen and anyone even when, who they'd run away, I'd keep talking, you know, before there was ever a camera wasn't on social media. In 2019, I posted a little bit, 2020, as you know, I started going on podcasts. But yeah, I just... The zest and delight in this stuff.",

It's music in the brain episode I've been researching for a while now, I'm just so hyped, I keep thinking about it. It's so interesting. There's so many facets. Singing versus improvisational, excuse me, music versus I'm listening to music versus learning music. I mean that, it just goes on and on. There's just so much, that's so interesting. I just can't get enough and I think, I dunno, you put a camera in front of me, I sort of forget about it and I'm just trying to just teach. - Yeah, so that's the difference, that's interesting. I mean- - Forget the camera. - Maybe I need to find that joy as well, but like for me, a lot of the joys in the writing, and the camera, there's something- - Well, the best lecturers, as you know, and you're in a phenomenal lecturer, so you embody this as well. But when I teach at Stanford, I was directing this course in neuroanatomy and neuroscience for medical students. And I noticed that the best lecturers would come in and they're teaching the material from a place of deep understanding, but they're also experiencing it as a first-time learner as at the same time. So it's just sort of embodying the delight of it, but also the authority over the, not authority, but the sort of mastery of the material. And it's really the delight in it that the students are linking onto it. And of course, they need and deserve the best accurate material, so they have to know what they're talking about. But yeah, just tap into that energy of learning and loving it, and people are long for the ride. Or you know, I get accused of being long-winded, but, you know, things get taken outta context that leads to greater misunderstanding.

And if it means you have to hit pause and come back a day or two later, like, that seems like a reasonable compromise to me. I'm not gonna go longer than I need to and I'm trying to shorten them up. But again, that's kinda how I show up. It's like Tim Armstrong would say about writing songs. I asked him, do you write, how often do you write? Every day? Every day. Has Rick ever stopped creating? No. Has Joe ever stopped preparing for comedy? Are you ever stopping to think about world issues and technology and who you can talk to? I mean, it seems to me you've always got a plan, the insight. The thing I love about your podcast the most, to be honest these days, is the surprise of like, I don't know who the hell's gonna be there. It's almost like, I get a little nervously excited about when a new episode comes 'cause I have no idea. No idea. And you know, I mean, I have some guesses based on what you told me during the break. I mean, you've got some people where it's just like, whoa! Lex has went there? Awesome. Can't wait, click. You know, I think that's really cool. Like, you're constantly surprising people. So you're doing it so well. Like, it's such a high-level. And I think it's also important for people to understand that what you're doing, Lex, there's no precedent for it. Sure, there have been interviews before, there have been podcasts before. There are discussions before, but it's not like, how many of your peers can you look to, to find out how best to do the content like yours? Zero. There's one peer, you.

        "text": "I don't wanna take an unnecessary tangent, but I think this might thread together two of the things that we've been talking about, which are, I think of pretty key importance. One is romantic relationships, and the other is creative process and the work. And this again, is something I learned from Rick, but that he and I have gone back and forth on. And that I think is worth elaborating on, which is, earlier we were saying, you know, the best relationship is gonna be one where it brings you peace. I think peace also can be translated to, among other things, lack of distraction. So when you're with your partner, can you really focus on them and the relationship? Can you not be distracted by things that you're upset about from their past or from your past with them or their, and of course, the same is true for them, right? They ideally will feel that way towards you too, they can really focus. Also, when you're not with them, can you focus on your work? Can you not be worried about whether or not they're okay? 'Cause you trust that they're an adult and they can handle things or they will reach out if they need things? They're gonna communicate their needs like an adult, you know, not creating message just to get attention and things like that. Or disappearing, you know, for that matter. So peace and focus are intimately related, and distraction is the enemy of peace and focus. So there's something there, I believe, because with people that have the strong generative drive and want to, you know, be productive in their home life in the sense have a rich family life or partner life, whatever that is. And in their work life, you know, the ability to really drop into the work and like, okay, you might have that sense like, I hope they're okay or, you know, need to check my phone or something. But just know like, we're good. So peace and focus, I think being present are so key. And it's key at every level of romantic relationship from, you know, certainly presence and focus, you know, everything from sex to listening to, you know, raising a family,",

And they're both important reflections of the other. And when you start to just, you know, when work is not going well, then the focus on relationship can suffer and vice versa. - And it's crazy how important that is. How incredibly wonderful it could be to have a person in your life that kind of enables that creative focus. - Yeah, and you supply the peace and focus for their endeavors, whatever those might be. I mean that symmetry there, because clearly, people have different needs and the need to just really trust, you know, like when Lex is working, he's in his generative mode and I know he's good. And so then they feel sure they've contributed to that, but then also what you're doing is supporting them in whatever way it happens to be. And I think that sometimes you'll see that people will pair up along creative, creative or musical, musical, or computer scientists. But I think, again, going back to this Conti episode on relationships is that the superficial labels are less important it seems than just the desire to create that kind of home life and relationship together. And as a consequence, the work mode. And for some people they're both people aren't working. And sometimes they are. But I think that's the good stuff, you know? And I think that's the big learning in all of it, is that the further along I go with each birthday, I guarantee you're gonna be like, what I want is simpler and simpler, and harder and harder to create, but oh, so worth it. - The inner and the outer peace. It's been over two years, I think since Costello passed away. - [Andrew] It still tears me up. - You mentioned him still. - I cried about him today, I cried about him today. - Still? - It's proportional to the love.

And the craziest thing happened, Lex is, was unbelievable. I've never had an experience like this. I expected my heart to break. And I've felt a broken heart before. I felt it, frankly, when my parents split, I felt it when Harry shot himself. I felt it when Barbara died and felt it, when, you know, when Ben went, so as well. And so many friends, like way too many friends. I mean, the end of 2017, my friend Aaron King, Johnny Farer, John Eckelberry, stomach cancer, suicide, fentanyl. It's like, whoa!

When Costello went, the craziest thing happened. My heart warmed up, like heated up. And I wasn't on MDMA and just the moment he went, it just went whoosh! And I was like, what the hell is this? And it was just like a supernatural experience to me. I just never had that. I put my grandfather on the ground, I was a pallbearer at the funeral. I've like done that more times than I'd like to have ever done it. And it just heated up with Costello and I thought, what the fuck is this?

I mean, when, and excuse me for welling up, but it was just, I mean, it's a freaking dog, right? I get it. But for me, it was the first real home I ever had. But when Costello went, it was like, we had had this home in Topanga. We had set it up and we're like, and he was just so happy there. And I think it just... I don't know, it was like this weird like victory slash massive loss. Like we did it 11 years. Freaking did everything to make him as comfortable as possible.

That flipped a switch in me. I was like, I want kids.
