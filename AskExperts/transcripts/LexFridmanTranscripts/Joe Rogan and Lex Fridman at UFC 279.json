I think that's a real chance it's a it's chaos surprise it's a totally different kind of fight he's a chaos kind of guy though yeah I mean I think it's an exciting fight I'm excited well I don't like the facts the best way that's a lot to miswave by so there's like two things could happen he miswade because he didn't prepare properly which usually indicates either he was sick or injured or he didn't want to make the way you know maybe he was like so worked up by all this Nate Dia stuff that he didn't want to get in the sauna he didn't want to cut the weight who knows what's going on we don't know yeah we really don't know you'd have to get friends with him where he could confide in you and you tell you the truth it was amazing to see you do this in person and amazing to see the fighters in person man thank you tomorrow's going to be even crazier foreign [Music] so like this shot right here this is a perfect example this seems like an easy shot but you know it's not an easy shot it's getting to that ball I'm down there yeah so that ball when the ball's down there like that like kind of in the middle but not in front of that hole there's only two places to be on that door you have to be on the",
