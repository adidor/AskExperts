I'm seeing all these verified accounts that are, you know, quote tweeting it, and demanding a retraction and whatever. And I go, uh oh, okay, this looks like it's getting some attention. I then continue about my day. Around noon, I hear from my dad that he got 100 messages, from, \"You should have aborted your son\", to, \"We're gonna find all of you\", to whatever else. My dad has no idea what's going on. He's like, I don't know what this is, but I have 100 DMs to everything else you can imagine. And I start to get emails about, you know, your Jewish faith, this and that and the other thing. And so at that point, to me, I thought, this is just going to get worse and worse and worse. And so I deleted the tweet. And I really regret doing that, because over the 48 hours that followed, yes, the attacks escalated, it went through Candace Owens and then at foxnews.com, Newsmax, kind of peaking with, with Donald Trump Jr. And it was horrible. The following is a conversation with David Pakman, a left wing, progressive political commentator and host of the David Pakman Show. I hope to continue to have many conversations on politics with prominent, insightful, and sometimes controversial figures across the political spectrum. David and I have been planning to speak for a long time, and I'm sure we'll speak many more times. This conversation was challenging, eye-opening and fun. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's David Pakman. Are there interesting differences to you between terms like Liberal, Democrat, left wing, leftist, progressive, socialist, communist, Marxist, far left, center left, all of these labels? Is there interesting distinctions between them? - Yeah, there's two sets of distinctions. One is if you just want to say, let's define each of these as political terms. They're all different terms. You can be a progressive ideologically but not be a member of the Democratic Party. Many say the Democratic Party",

        "text": "isn't even really very progressive. So these are certainly terms that we could define in order to have a conversation about the next thing, kind of as a precursor to a conversation. Sometimes the terms are used in order to tag someone with a certain ideology that's not really linked to policy or any particular political question, but they can be used positively or negatively to just kind of say, here is the image of this individual that I have in my mind. So like Marxist is right now very popularly being used by some on the right to attack Democrats. There's very few actual Marxists, certainly not in positions of power in the United States, but even among the general population. So I think it's important to distinguish, are we defining these terms because we want to compare and contrast the ideas that a particular group might bring to the discussion, or are we using them as insults or to stifle conversation? There are terms that can be used to start conversation or to stop it. - And the use of those terms is evolving rapidly month by month. So the term leftist, I think is a relatively popular term now to use in the negative context to describe what an outraged left wing commentator. - I think what you're kind of grasping onto is that there's probably some set of ideas that would apply to most of those who consider themselves to be on the left. The discussion of how that term is mostly being used is not about policy ideas. You're accurately kind of identifying that. And it does seem like progressive is no longer being used as a smear, and leftist is being used as a smear more at this point. - Okay, but sometimes some of these terms are useful, like can we try to pick the terms that are useful, like Liberal and progressive and Democrat. Liberal and progressive, is there an interesting definable distinction between Liberal and progressive to you? - That's a maybe one of the most interesting ones. 10 years ago Liberal often meant what now we mean by progressive. More recently, the progressive socialist leaning part of the political spectrum",

        "text": "has started to use Liberal to mean Joe Biden, to mean someone who is not really left enough. So Liberal's very interesting because I remember talking with my audience years ago, maybe eight years ago or something like that, where I identified I'm going to now use the term progressive more commonly to describe my own beliefs, because Liberal has now been made a smear. It's being shifted into something else. And it also means more of like a center left politics. So it's changed in some sense by necessity, by force. And also because the spectrum has shifted to some degree. - So the term Liberal has evolved, now Liberal meaning some kind of embodiment of the mainstream Democratic Party almost. - To some degree. Sometimes I'm called, I'm written off by, you know, within my space, there are all sorts of shades of gray, which I'm sure we can talk about, about where I am, versus should be, could be, or am wrongly placed. And sometimes an attack on me is, he's just a Lib, meaning I'm not left enough, I'm not progressive, socialist, wherever else you want to go. So yeah, the problem with a lot of these terms, and they're used very casually by people who call into my show, is that unless we actually define them each time, they very often mean very different things to different people, and often come with an agenda attached to them. And so I find that they often stifle meaningful conversation rather than encourage it. - Hey, do you sense that there's a drifting of what is the threshold to be a progressive? Or is there, should we use progressive synonymously with Democratic socialists? - I think we should not use it synonymously with Democratic socialists. And this is where there's another linguistic confusion and a political confusion. So we'll first talk about the linguistic one. Social democracy versus Democratic socialism. Very similar words in a different order, okay? The way I operate is Democratic socialism is actually a form of socialism where one would seek to socialize ownership of the means of production as an example. Social democracy is a very highly regulated form",

I associate progressivism in 2023 with social democracy and would consider Democratic socialism a form of actual socialism. That is different. We're no longer talking about a capitalist organization of society. - So transition from one to the other is a fundamental shift in how society operates then? - Absolutely. And when you talk about social democracy, you're talking about socializing a couple more things than we socialize in most modern capitalist countries. I had this conversation with Patrick Bet-David recently. Social democracy is, okay, we've socialized the military already in the United States. We've socialized some healthcare in the sense of like the VA and Medicaid, et cetera. We're talking about socializing a couple more things still in a capitalist country. Democratic socialism would be something beyond that. And as someone who is not a Democratic socialist myself, I'm maybe not the best advocate for explaining exactly how that system would function, but it would have some version of socializing ownership of the means of production businesses, et cetera. - So you mentioned you appeared on the PBD podcast with Patrick Bet-David. The debate was pretty intense. - [David] Was it? - I should say, I personally enjoyed it. I thought actually you did well, and I thought Patrick did well, and it was a good conversation. There was a little bit of tension. - [David] Yeah. - And I thought that Patrick actually, so I disagreed with the internet. I thought Patrick just took on a kind of devil's advocate. Like he was purposely being stubborn to bring out the best in you. But the internet thought that he's being stubborn, not being open to your ideas. I thought the tension between ideas, I think a lot of the tension had to do probably with Donald Trump and Trump supporters.",

And people wrote to me the full gamut of everything you can imagine, from this was your best thing you've ever done in public, to you got humiliated and your mother should have aborted you. Okay, so and everything in between. So, you know, take your pick. But the most interesting feedback I got was from people who asked me, after, was it incredibly tense and awkward, and because it seemed so combative. And I think for, I'm so used to those types of tensions in the discussions that I have that it's very comfortable to me. It's not like afterwards it's, there's a grudge or it's tense or whatever the case may be. I'm very comfortable just, I disagree with people and that's it. So I did not find anything that happened inappropriate. I disagreed with a lot of the things he said, certainly. - So you also spoken with Michael Knowles, I think about the idea of what is a woman. Can you speak broadly about your conversations with people you disagree with? You know, some of the cases it feels like it's gone wrong. - The conversations have gone wrong. - [Lex] Yeah. - Yeah, I mean, I think there's a couple different things. And I'm the first to tell you that depending on who I'm talking to, I go in with a different attitude about how, quote, seriously I'm taking it in the sense of whether I think it's going to be a deep policy discussion, versus whether it's going to be more of a performance for an audience that is expecting a certain thing. And I think there's different types of shows. When I was interviewed by this guy, Jesse Lee Peterson in Los Angeles, it's very different, for example, than when I'm talking to Patrick Bet-David, just to give two examples. I think the reason I stopped doing the Michael Knowles Show was the number of of threats I would get after the fact. That's really the, I was glad to engage with him to the extent that the interviews were interesting and, you know, we could organize it reasonably efficiently. But the reason I stepped away was sort of the aftermath. But I did find him to be someone who was abundantly clear",

I found it easy to engage in the conversation just because of how upfront and clear he was about what his beliefs were. - But the number of threats, it's too much. - Yeah, it was just too much. And this, you know, I don't know if how much you saw about this recent Twitter dust up I was involved in that peaked with Donald Trump Jr. tweeting about me, and then that then declining from there. - Oh, let's talk through it, I didn't see it. - Okay. - I have to understand, like the way you study Shakespeare, I have to study your Twitter. I have to understand how much of it is sarcasm, how much-- - It's mostly sarcasm. I mean here's the thing, and I know that there are people who will say, David, you're dealing with such serious issues, it's really not okay not to take everything you do completely seriously. But my view is, it's so incredible that I've, between chance and timing and so different things fallen into a position where this is what I do professionally, and it's a career, and it's financially sustainable and all these different things. I don't wanna end up taking myself too seriously because I recognize the timing and luck and all of these other things. And this could have gone a completely different way. So my approach to a lot of this is let's not take ourselves too seriously, and in particular on Twitter, a platform that, you know, the degree to which it should be taken very seriously maybe has changed over time. I'm always sort of thinking a little bit tongue in cheek on Twitter. - So what happened with Donald Trump Jr.? - [David] So. - Or the full arc of it. - Yeah, to give you a one minute arc and then we can pick whichever parts we want.

That there's some confusion about how there would be a shooting at a Christian school given that it is a place where prayer is taking place. I think, you know, jokingly said something like, were they not praying enough or correctly? - In my deep journalistic integrity. - You have it. - I have your tweet. - [David] Beautiful, beautiful. - This is the only display of journalistic integrity I will show today. Okay, and then I have a couple of responses. - [David] Beautiful. - And you deleted the tweet since then. - Which I regret. - Oh, interesting. - [David] And we can talk about that. - Well I would love to because it's such a interesting decision, because when you tweet something, one of the things I've also learned is you don't often understand how it's going to be read. It's going to be analyzed, like I mentioned, Shakespeare. Like there's certain, the use of certain words that you regret saying in a certain kind of way, maybe just 'cause it wasn't as eloquent, as powerful. It didn't actually convey the thing, or is the distraction to the main message, all that kind of stuff. Okay, the actual tweet is, \"Very surprising that there would be a mass shooting at a Christian school, \"given that lack of prayer is often blamed \"for these horrible events. \"Is it possible they weren't praying enough or correctly \"despite being a Christian school?\" And a lot of people quote retweeted that, which I'm assuming was criticism. So Colin Wright wrote, \"I used to consider you a reasonable progressive, \"but you clearly devolved into partisan hackery. \"I'm an atheist. \"It cannot begin to fathom \"using the murder of children and adults",

So do you want the arc leading to the deleting of it? - [Lex] Yes, please. - So basically-- - [Lex] I just wanted to display-- - Do you know what time of day I tweeted the original one? I feel like it was in the afternoon or evening on a Monday. - 3:42 PM on 27th, March 27th. - Which was a Monday, okay. So basically I tweet that and then I finish the day. - So you tweet, and then you go on with your day. - I might have looked once at Twitter, and it had 2,000 likes and a few people saying, eh, this might have missed the mark. But it's sort of like, it's one of my 20,000 tweets, I don't know. I wake up the next morning, my baby daughter did not sleep till 7:30 the way I would like, so she's up at 6:00 AM, and I get up, and I'm just there starting to make breakfast. And I glance at my phone, and I'm starting to, this was when verified meant a different thing than it means now. I'm seeing all these verified accounts that are, you know, quote tweeting it, and demanding a retraction and whatever.

Of course you weren't doing that, I wish you hadn't deleted it, so that it would still be up and you would now see the tide kind of turning on it. This was not a fun three days regardless, but I do regret having deleted it because it was a- I wanted to do the quickest thing I thought I could to get people to stop trying to find family members and send them threats. And so around noon, that's what I did. And the truth is the threats didn't stop anyway, 'cause everybody had screenshotted it. And I do wish I had left it up. - And is there some degree, maybe stepping outside yourself, do you regret tweeting that, in that it feeds the mockery engine that fuels Twitter? So like, does that tweet really represent what you believe? - It absolutely represents the disgust with politics that includes saying we can't touch guns, we just, we can't. But we're willing to point to mental health, or say we need more prayer in schools or whatever. 1000% it represents that view. Is it the type of snark and sarcasm that I would use if given an hour to discuss the topic rather than whatever the number of characters is now on Twitter? No, definitely not. And so I am very cognizant of the fact that it was unnecessarily provocative how it was written. - I think I asked similar question to Ben Shapiro. Do you worry that this style of presentation can turn you from being, you know, a deeply thoughtful, objective political thinker, to somebody who is just a partisan hack? Or partisan, what's a good word, talking head? - Do you mean with regard to Twitter, or the format of my show in general? - So Twitter for now, let's start with Twitter for now.

I don't have deep thoughts about the Twitter component, beyond, I think across all sorts of disciplines, this is not the best way to most effectively solve problems and figure out solutions to complex issues. - [Lex] You're talking about Twitter? - Now, right now I'm talking about Twitter. That being said, I think all of us to some degree have to adapt our content to the platform that we're using, in the same way that what I post to YouTube is different than what I post to TikTok. What I post to Twitter is also different. Do I think Twitter has been an unmitigated good for society? No. Have I chosen to step into Twitter as one of the ways in which I get my message out with the good and the bad? Yes. And I think that there is a deep conversation to be had there. I think zooming out a little bit in terms of what I do, and I was hoping this would come up because I think it's really interesting. I will often get emails from people who say two things. I will get the, you would have such a bigger audience if you did X type emails. And usually they are plays to sensationalism, salacious and titillating content, more pop culture stuff, et cetera. On the other hand, it's folks who say, listen, what you're doing really isn't as serious as it could be, and it seems like you could do something more serious, and you should consider doing deep dives. You know, once it was, do a deep dive into Calvin Coolidge, and I was like, nobody will watch that. So it's not by accident that my show is the way it is, right? In an hour, I'm thinking of all the platforms I'm on, and I'm saying, okay, I wanna do a relatively deep dive on the federal budget, and I want to talk about some of the political tomfoolery going on within the post office. And I'm gonna do a segment about the wacky rally where Trump said crazy things and made up three words and said he endorsed a candidate who's named it, right?",

It's a deliberate thing. And I'm aware that if I were producing my show 50 years ago, the balance would probably be different, and it would probably change again. If we didn't, if the show was audio only, rather than having all these video platforms, it would also be different. But it's a decision that's proactively made to try to get the best and most out of the hour that I'm creating every day. - Well it just feels like there's an entire machine fed by Twitter and journalism that wants to divide people. And the drama of that division, highlighting the partisan division, the drama of that division feels like it's a tension with objective, clear thinking sometimes. And so that's the, I worry that there's a drug to it. There's too much fun to mock ridiculous people on the other side. - I think you're right about that. And the fact that that is true, to me supports, I've talked with my audience about, you know, like the old food pyramid, which I guess was like wrong, but let's imagine that there was a pyramid that made sense. - [Lex] What's at the bottom, bread? - I think like whole grains maybe? I don't remember, it's been a while-- - Sugar is on the top. - Junk food is at the very top. I'm very open with my audience. The vast majority of what I do is the top of that pyramid.

And I think it's really important to, as a base, be doing critical thinking, epistemology, how do we believe the things we believe, basics about the world.

Is there some degree to which you're, through mocking, maybe Republicans, that there's a lean to that audience, and then you become captured by the audience? Do you worry about the audience capture? - I worry about it. I'm relatively comfortable that it's not shaping the program to a great degree in the sense that at this point, I have a pretty good sense of the things I can say that will upset what I might call my core audience. You know, one of the interesting things, just to briefly go back to the Twitter thing was, those people who were furious with me on Twitter, and they contacted my advertisers, and some advertisers dropped me, and on and on and on. None of them are actually in my audience. None of them are regular consumers of my audience. They were kind of weaponized against me by people who said, hey, look at this. The people who follow Candace Owens on Twitter, other than for their kind of shock value, they're not in my audience. And with my core audience, I know there are things I can talk about that will generate displeasure, I guess you could say with my audience. Sometimes when I touch the Israeli Palestinian conflict, that will happen. Sometimes on vaccines, there's a portion of my audience that is more generally skeptical of vaccines.

There's a lot of good questions that I'll probably bring up, but one of them was about Marianne Williamson, asking why David thinks she's a garbage candidate, which of course-- - I've never said. - But perhaps you have more eloquently criticized. So let's go there to the 2024 election. - [David] Okay. - So Biden, Joe Biden officially announced that he's running again. Donald Trump officially announced that he's running again. If that's the matchup, who do you think wins? - If the election's held today? I think Biden. - Why? - Well first of all, I believe he won last time. And if I start with the results from 2020, and I think to myself what has happened since then that would push or pull voters one way or the other, I have a hard time making a case that Trump is in a better position today than he was in November of 2020. So that's kind of my starting point, which is it's a rematch of an election with a known outcome. What has changed? And I can't make a case for circumstances having changed in Trump's favor. To give a couple of state level examples, Florida seems to be kind of moving more to the Republican side since 2020, but Trump won that state already in 2020. So it wouldn't really change the outcome. Arizona was close. I think Arizona has moved to the left since 2020. So I don't see Trump taking that one.",

        "text": "Wisconsin, I think the same sort of thing applies. So being very like practical, that would be kind of the start of my reasoning. - Do you think Joe Biden is a better candidate now than he was in 2020? - I think he's a worse candidate. This is going to sound ageist, but I think he's a worse candidate in that he's even older and there already seems to be an appetite for younger candidates, particularly on the Democratic voting side. So he's going to be four years older, and in a sense that could be a liability. However, he also is going to have four years of accomplishments. Now, you might not like the things he's done, in which case that would hurt him, but he has started to accumulate a not insignificant number of accomplishments. Some of the big things that are known, Inflation Reduction Act, and COVID stimulus, you know, but also less well known things, like a bunch of little tweaks to healthcare, a bunch of little tweaks to student lending. There's been a lot of little things. At the macro level, I don't actually think Joe Biden has that much to do with this, the same way I didn't credit or attack Trump for a lot of the macroeconomic stuff, but inflation has started to come down significantly, the stock market's quite steady, these sort of things. I think looking historically, it's a pretty okay environment for Joe Biden, with the exception that he was already the oldest President to be inaugurated in 2021, and he would beat his own record in January of 2025. And I just don't know how voters are gonna see that. - So in terms of just a public human being, how would you compare Trump and Biden? So if I were to give criticism towards Trump, it would be that he's chaotic, maybe to the point of being disrespectful to a lot of different groups, to a lot of different ideas, to a lot of different nations and leaders and all that kind of stuff. And then the criticism towards Biden would be that he, maybe perhaps because of age, or any other kind of cognitive capabilities is not really there mentally as a, you know, in the way that perhaps you could say",

So, which, in the competition of personality flaws, which do you think is more powerful? - You've laid out fair, and I believe accurate assessments of elements of both of those men. You haven't weighed in on to what degree you value each of those assessments, which is where I think the kind of meat of this question really is. I don't see, and I know that, you know, Biden's gonna get us into World War III, World War III doesn't seem to be happening. I don't see the Biden deficits you listed, which I agree with you on. I don't see them as dangerous or threatening to the standing of the United States in this kind of environment with our traditional western allies and geopolitics, et cetera, in the way that the sort of unhinged personality of Trump, combined with his lack of knowledge about most issues is a threat. So for me, if those two are the candidates, Biden would be my choice. Now, are there people I would rather see on the Democratic side? Yes. If I knew the President would be a Republican, can I think of better options than Trump? Absolutely. You know, it's so funny, when in 2012 it was Obama versus Romney, the difference seemed so significant between them. Thinking back, I'm sure I would disagree with Mitt Romney about tax rates and his views on LGBT are, I'm sure, I know are different than mine. But it seems without looking at him with rose colored glasses, so comparatively benign given the four years of Trump. So that's kind of where I come down. - Even McCain and Obama, the differences seemed quite drastic. - Yeah. McCain was interesting because Palin, as his running mate, opened the door to the sort of cartoonish stuff that we've started to see on the Republican side. Palin, Trump, Marjorie Taylor Greene,",

Which of the label do you think captures your political views? - Progressive Social Democrat, which, again is a capitalist. I own my own business. I pay the taxes I'm legally required to pay and not a penny more. And, you know, all those things, that's where I place myself. - Would you place yourself to the left of Joe Biden for Senate? - Yes, yes. - Where does AOC fit into that? - That's a good question. - What do you think about AOC as a candidate? Do you think she eventually runs? - I think that if she doesn't run into some kind of scandal, and I don't mean scandal in the sense of some personal impropriety, that you know, but I mean some kind of major political problem. It seems that she has the staying power to be in American elected politics for a long time. Whether she would even want to be President, versus maybe going to the Senate, or being Governor, or whatever the case may be, I have no idea what her ambitions are in that sense. But certainly like policy aside, she has this combination of charisma, likability to some, but also something about her personality that angers the people who don't like her in a way that only fuels her sort of presence. Which I think applies to Trump as well, that I do think that she has the potential to be, to have significant staying power in American politics. President, I don't know. - Do you think that's the future of political elections and politics in general, is people who are able to skillfully piss off the other side, like AOC and Trump did? - I think it's an aspect of it.

And this is why it's very hard for me to believe that Ron DeSantis has what it takes to actually fight Trump in a national primary. And one of those things is Trump has a, even though he often says very strange things, that if you transcribe them, you go, what language is that? That doesn't make any sense whatsoever. In the moment, the way he relates to adversaries on stage, et cetera, is very good in that he is very much aware of how it is going to be seen by the audience. And so that's why a lot of times, it's more about doesn't matter that a word salad came out of his mouth, how he immediately responded and related to the person, very good. So I think that knowing how to be good when clips are shared all the time, often out of context is extraordinarily important. Knowing how to use social media, which every election cycle, that means something different. But understanding how to use social media, very important. Those things are absolutely so important. And whether you're able to do a deep dive on the deficit, it's certainly useful. But I would say it's a bad thing. It's becoming less important in terms of figuring out who we want to represent us. - So just lingering on the AOC, and then maybe let's throw in Bernie Sanders on that. So where do you place yourself and how do you do the layout of the land of Bernie Sanders, AOC, Joe Biden, and David Pakman? - My instinct is, and I'm going to answer it, the thing that makes this tough is Bernie says, he's a Democratic socialist. He ran as a social Democrat. He didn't run on anything that was really socialism. So I'm going by their public facing platforms. - I've been listening to him for many, many years, and all the way back to the Thom Hartman Show. And I think using the terms as you've been using them, he has, I don't think ever been a Democratic socialist. I haven't heard him speak about socialism.",

You and I even who weren't around, we were doing stuff in the '70s. - [Lex] I feel like we did, yeah. - My sense would be, you know, Biden is like center left, and then I'm to the left of that. But maybe just inside of where AOC and Bernie are, or very, very similar to Bernie. I mean I identify with a lot of Bernie's ideas. Maybe their implementation, I'm more flexible on. I'll give you one example, Medicare for all. One way of trying to get healthcare to everybody, which Bernie's very big on, is you take the current Medicare program, you just eliminate the age limit, make it available to everybody, pay for it through taxation. Interesting. However, I'm open to other models if they get everybody healthcare, that is good quality and affordable. Singapore has an interesting model, Germany has an interesting model. I am more agnostic about how we do it than just saying, let's expand Medicare. Whether that puts me to the right of Bernie, I don't know, but I'm not like exactly right there on it has to be Medicare for all. - Yeah, that's more just flexibility versus dogmatism. So I don't know if that puts you to the left or to the right. - I don't either. - What do you think about the, we could term manipulation or the corruption in the DNC that perhaps tipped the skills against Bernie in the election?

Just your audience may not know, I'm just a independent. I mostly vote for candidates that end up being Democrats. In local elections, often there's no party designation. So okay, I'm obviously on the left, I'm not denying that. But the Democratic Party as an institution has never really been interesting to me. - You're still a rebel that resists belonging to any institution. - Exactly right, exactly right. And whether it matters, I don't know. The DNC and the RNC really are organizations that to some degree exist to justify their own existence because if they were no longer necessary, they would go away. And so they have to assert their value and their importance. They do this in a number of different ways. Organizing the way that the nominee is chosen, the convention, working with states on everything from redistricting to whatever else the case may be. Setting the order of primaries and having some involvement in how that's all going to happen. And also coordinating behind the scenes, I guess they would describe it as making sure our candidates don't get in each other's ways. We might see it and say, they're picking the winner. There's nothing illegal about them being involved in picking the winner, but we might say it's not in people's interests. I think the 2020 primary was really interesting. Bernie supporter myself, I started telling my audience after a couple primaries and even before, based on polling and different things, I see a real uphill battle here for Bernie. And it's really important, people in my audience are not the average, you know, union worker in Michigan who is mostly working and raising a family, and then goes to vote on primary day and goes to vote on election day. If you spend a lot of time on Reddit and Twitter, you're going to have an inflated sense of Bernie's popularity within the Democratic Party. That was my sense.

South Carolina was when Joe Biden won and won handily, understood to be because of the larger African American population in South Carolina. And right around that exact same time, I actually don't remember now whether it was the day after or the day before, some of the smaller Democratic candidates, smaller in terms of support, got out and said, I'm endorsing Joe Biden. And to some degree, of course, it was all organized and timed to help Joe Biden. There's no doubt about that. This is what the DNC does. It's hard for me to be mad at the DNC because this is sort of like, if we believe they were there to be unbiased arbiters and to stay as much on the side as possible, it would make sense to be furious that they've gone against their stated, you know, kind of mandate. But we know that the DNC negotiates and is working behind the scenes, and has a favorite, that favorite was Hillary in 2016, 2020. So I share the frustration about the power that the DNC has, but for people who were saying they did something illegal or whatever else the case may be, that doesn't seem to be the case. But this is part of why, I mean, I would love there not to be this duopoly of Republicans and Democrats. And there's probably four major changes that have to happen in order to make that a reality. But I share the frustration of folks while recognizing that Reddit was not accurately representing Bernie's level of popularity. - Still I wish that the bias wasn't towards the, what could be negatively termed the deep state, towards the bureaucracy, towards the momentum of the past, which I think Joe Biden kind of represents versus new ideas. Which is funny to say that Bernie Sanders somehow represents new ideas, 'cause he is also an older gentleman. - Well it's a lot of framing.

Which is interesting because I don't disagree with you. - Yeah, and you also have to say, the perspective doesn't always align with the policies. You're right on, you know, the actual policies of Joe Biden are different than maybe the perception of Joe Biden. - Or what he ran on. I mean, just two examples I would give are, during his campaign, he played up a little bit, his interest in doing student loan forgiveness and something on cannabis. I never bought it. I told my audience, I think he's saying this stuff because this is the way the tide is kind of, the wind is blowing and he's being advised to say this stuff. I don't think he's gonna do very much on either of these things. He did actually do some student loan stuff. But that would be two examples I think. - Okay, let's go to the, something you alluded to, which is the pros and cons of a particular candidate. Well, what to you, as a critic of Trump, what to you are the pros, the strengths of Donald Trump, and what to you are his biggest weaknesses? - The strengths of Trump. Let's see how I can frame them in a way that is both accurate and accurately assesses my feeling about it. - And could be taken out of context most masterfully through the clipping process. - Yes. Trump's strengths are mostly superficial, and in terms of presentation. Trump was able to, I call it a grift. Some on the right say he's just so good at relating to different types of people. Trump as a rich guy from New York City, was able to convince people that he spent most of his life trying to be kept isolated from, that he had their best interests in mind, that he knew why they weren't doing well in the 2016 economy,",

He didn't really understand the causes of the problems that those folks were experiencing. And his solutions were laughable, right? Like Jared was going to solve the Israeli Palestinian conflict in year one. He was gonna replace Obamacare in 2017. Things that were never going anywhere, anywhere.

He called that smart, et cetera.

Only someone who doesn't know anything about the size and scope of these issues could so arrogantly say that they could solve them in that way and on that timeframe.

A lot of people saw it and liked it. As someone who followed a lot of those issues closely, they seemed of course like impossible promises. - Well it's a double-edged sword. So to push back a little bit, if you look at the things I have a little bit more knowledge about, which is the space of artificial intelligence, there's a company called DeepMind, and there's a company called OpenAI that we're laughed at for a long time when they were talking about that they're going to solve intelligence. And now they've made, especially DeepMind, and now most recently OpenAI with GPT, they've made progress that most of the AI community would not have imagined they'd be able to make. Everything from AlphaGo beating the world Go champion. Just all the different steps and progress that I can get into, were surprised everybody. And they are legitimately fearlessly pursuing the task of solving intelligence. The other aspect, he gets a lot of criticism now, but another example is Elon Musk. I can say a lot of things, like SpaceX, so commercial space flight. He was laughed at for a long time that that's possible. Same thing with autopilot in Tesla, autonomous vehicles. His approach was harshly criticized by all the experts, and still criticized, to this day, deeply criticized. And as a person that I believe objectively can look at the progress of autopilot as a semi-autonomous vehicle system has been incredibly surprising.

I think it's interesting that all of the examples you gave of successes are from the technology space. - Not politics, yes. - Not from politics, which I mean, listen, I would love to be able to make headway on some of these issues more quickly without a doubt. I do think at some point though, when it comes down to voting and saying, one of these people is going to be ostensibly in charge for four years through all of the departments, and secretaries and choices that they make, we do wanna apply some level of realism with the understanding that your examples are from the tech space. And they're good examples. There's no question about it. One thing I'll add to this, I recently read Bradley Hope's new book about North Korea, and it's really about an activist who doesn't even really matter, but in the background of the book, it's written, much of what is written about happens during the Trump era. And when Trump did the first and then the second, I guess you'd call them summits with Kim Jong Un. And it actually did seem like to some degree, Trump's were gonna handle this like I do a business deal approach to Kim Jong Un. In some sense it actually was logical because of Kim Jong Un and the way that it was so ego-driven, and they both as sort of authoritarian strong men types to different degrees wanted that.

Can you make the case that there's some positive outcomes of the way Donald Trump acted with China? - It's really tough, and I'll give you a couple reasons. - [Lex] Okay, then also cons. - Give you, it's tough to make. So the China thing is really, so just very recently to when we're recording this, Trump was on Fox News interviewed by a guy named Mark Levin. And Trump proposed a new, I call it a conspiracy theory, maybe it will strike you as something different about China, COVID, and tariffs. And Trump's suggestion was that the tariffs cost China so much money, China sent the US so much money in tariffs that they released COVID as punishment. Now there's a couple problems with that. One, American companies pay the tariffs. Trump still doesn't seem to know this. Trump seems to believe that when he puts a tariff on Chinese imports, someone in China is cutting a check to the United States. American companies buy the stuff from China, and then American companies cut a check to the United States for the tariff. Trump doesn't seem to get that. - But it still has a sting to the Chinese economy. - You can make the argument that if there is a suitable alternative domestically or from a different country, that it will reduce imports, but it didn't happen. And we actually have reports now that the tariffs on China cost about a quarter million American jobs. The other problem with that idea is China created and released a virus in order to hurt you. But as of today, 5.7 of the 6.8 million deaths were in other countries. It's a very indirect way. You're mostly killing people in other countries",

And in some sense the positive aspect here that Donald Trump is willing to take big risks in the game of geopolitics with this giant superpower that is China. And a lot of others are too afraid, too afraid to call them out, to come to the table and criticize. - I certainly think that's an argument that can be made. My question would be, what tangible positive outcomes did it lead to? And it's tough to identify any. But I think it's a great thing. I mean, listen, one of the things you're kind of getting at maybe indirectly is that there's been this sense that politics has been done very similarly for a long time. And even between Democrats and Republicans still, even with some policy differences, there's still the kind of feeling that it's disconnected folks in DC, mostly dealing with issues that don't directly affect. Look, I get that. I'm with you on that. I think the question as to whether Trump's bluster was positive rather than extraordinarily humiliating in many ways, I just come down on, it was an absolute and total humiliation. But I understand that you can recognize Trump doesn't know a lot of stuff, but his attitude was refreshing in some way. That's a reasonable position for someone to take. I disagree with it, but I understand it - Well, is trying and failing better than not trying? - This goes well beyond politics. You know, Wayne Gretzky has weighed in about this.

We didn't start any new wars. - [David] We didn't start-- - Is there something to that? - Yeah, that's, it's interesting. There's a few different approaches to dealing with that. First, it's really important to remember that the counterpoint to that from the folks who like to say that was that Hillary Clinton was gonna start three wars. Sometimes they say four wars, sometimes they say five wars. Okay. The geopolitical situation during the four years that Trump was in office, I don't know that they obviously lent themselves to wars that Trump just barely was able to keep us out of. I think the Russia thing is interesting, because now it's very popular to go back and say, you know, the reason Putin didn't do the Ukraine thing when Trump, right, and to somehow give Trump credit for that. There's a counterpoint to it, which is Putin under Trump, particularly if Trump got four more years, would've been able to maybe consolidate power in other ways because of his relationship with Trump. I'm not coming down on one side or the other. It's not my area of expertise. But it's not the open shut slam dunk that, you know, Trump likes to say this. Putin didn't invade because he knew I would crush 'em, and okay. So it's not obvious to me that there were imminently wars that would've started during that time. That being said, you know, for all the criticism of Obama during Crimea, Trump seemed to just kind of forget about that after all the criticism and say, I'm not actually gonna do anything about that.

He became convinced, either because of things he was being told, or because he decided this is the way it's going to be. This is gonna go away. Fine, it's in China. Okay, it's in China. In Italy, okay, we have 15 cases, but it'll soon be zero. We'll be open by Easter of 2020. None of it happened. If he had handled it in the following way, and I've said this to Rogan, and I've said this to Patrick Bet-David, and they tend to all see my side of this. If Trump had said, listen, we don't know how bad this is gonna be, but I care too much about the American people to take a shot. So it's not gonna be two weeks, it's gonna be a little bit, but I need your help. We're gonna bring everybody together. I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican, we're gonna have MAGA masks, and he could have kept 50 cents on the dollar to pay off Stormy or whoever, right? But it would've been, I think he wins reelection, because the perception was, and reality is a version of that. The perception was that he was way too cavalier about it early on. People died who didn't need to die. And I think that it was arguably the one area where he could have all but guaranteed that he was going to get himself reelected. - Well to push back on that, I mean, because you mentioned sort of masks and lockdowns kind of a solution to COVID. - I didn't mention lockdowns, but I'm glad to talk about policy. - Sure, quarantine,",

He, his administration fast tracked the development of the vaccine, which surprising he didn't really take much credit for. - I think he did, I think he tried. There's a couple, there's a lot there. - Well, to me, it seems like you could make the case with the Trump hand gestures, that his decisions for fast tracking the development of the vaccine saved tens of millions of lives You could make, he could in the Trumpian way, make that case. - So, couple different things. I know you don't necessarily follow Trump's rallies as closely as I do, and I'm jealous of you for that. But he did tout the vaccine stuff hugely for a while, until his audience turned against him. And then he had to draw this line where he was going, I made the vaccines, which none of you have to take, by the way, freedom. You don't have to take them, but it's fantastic. And nobody else could have done it. But don't worry, nobody's gonna make you take the vaccine. And he actually got booed at a couple of his own rallies when talking about the vaccines. But let's back up a little bit. Fast tracking, my understanding of what he did is he did what any President in his situation would do, and what many world leaders elsewhere did as well, which is he agreed to pre-purchase supply of vaccine, in order to provide money to pharmaceutical companies to scale up the manufacturing, which is absolutely fine. But he wants, one of the stories he tells is it usually takes 12 years to develop a vaccine. We did it in nine months thanks to me. Decades of mRNA technology being developed, created the platform in which you can make a particular vaccine in nine months. Didn't have anything to do with Trump. He did pre-fund and say, we will buy huge supply. And that provided liquidity to the pharmaceutical companies. - But he also delegated control to people, to experts that enabled that kind of fast tracking of vaccines, right? - He was very eager for the FDA to approve it,",

He did not get in the way of vaccines being developed, which is good. - Presidents and bureaucracies have a way of getting in the way. - And I don't disagree with that. I'm not aware of really any governments that got in the way. I mean, it seemed, given the global situation, everybody, European countries were pre-purchasing vaccine. African countries were, who were going to be later to receive vaccines, were partnering with the European countries that had pre-purchased. But the most interesting thing about all of this is Trump did play up the vaccines for a long time until his crowd didn't wanna hear about it anymore, which was crazy. It was sort of like he became a victim of the monster he created to some degree. - One of the effects of all this that makes me truly sad is this division over the vaccines has created distrust in science. - Yeah. - And also what makes me sad is the scientific leaders, Anthony Fauci being one of the representatives of that community, I would say completely dropped the ball. - Hmm, in what way? - They spoke with arrogance. They spoke down to people, they spoke in a way that a great scientist does not speak, which is they spoke with certainty, without humility. Like they have all the wisdom, and all of us are too dumb to understand it, but they're going to be the parent that tells us exactly what to do, versus speaking to the immensity of the problem, the deep core of the problem being the uncertainty. We don't know what to do. The terrifying thing about the pandemic, we don't know anything about it as it's happening. And so you have to make decisions, you have to take risks about, well maybe you have to overreact in order to protect the populace. But it's in the face of uncertainty, they have to do that, not powered, empowered by science somehow, and the deep expertise as somebody like Anthony Fauci",

And that you have to blame the leaders, I mean, to the degree, leaders take responsibility. And I think Anthony Fauci was the scientific leader behind the American response to the pandemic. And I think he failed as a scientist, as a representative of science. - I'm less, I don't know if interested is the right word, but the kind of the Fauci review is less interesting to me in terms of what comes next than the first part you mentioned, which is the distrust in science. And sometimes I'll get voicemails or emails from people in my audience who say, that I have had to backpedal on certain things related to this. And one of the things I tried to do from the beginning was not speak in certain terms when we really didn't have complete information. So there was this period where hydroxychloroquine was first sort of mentioned as a possible treatment, prophylactic, or you know, proactive treatment for COVID, or active treatment for COVID, along with a bunch of other stuff. There was ivermectin, there was Vitamin D, there were all sorts of different things. And I tried to be careful to say, right now we don't have rigorous science that tells us that some of these things work. It doesn't mean that won't come in the future. At which point, if there was something as cheap as hydroxychloroquine that treated COVID effectively, unbelievable, fantastic. It's not, there's no way it ever will be determined. We don't have that information right now. So it's not super wise right now to go and start taking this stuff. We eventually learned, like with Vitamin D, having an appropriate Vitamin D level does seem to be, based on what I've most recently read, generally protective, and a good thing when it comes to infections of different, great. Okay, so that one we figured out. One of the really difficult things is that the quote, truth about the vaccines did change. And the original, again, this is all, I don't pretend to be an expert, but just someone who's synthesizing the medical data",

        "text": "and writing about it, originally, the first vaccine related to the wild type strain did seem to be very effective, not only at preventing death and serious illness, but also transmission. There were people then saying, it doesn't prevent transmission. Over time, as the variants came forward, the vaccine became less effective at that. At that point I started telling my audience something different, because as far as I was concerned, the reality on the ground had changed. In my mind, that's how science works. It's not backpedaling, it's we're adjusting our beliefs to what is taking place in the real world. - Well, to be fair, the scientists, many of whom are my friends, viralogists and biologists, they have way more humility than people like Anthony Fauci, who are speaking about this, or the CEO of Pfizer who are speaking about this. This is the fundamental problem here. Is the way science work is, has, the way science works is there's usually a lot more humility and a lot more transparency about what we know and what we don't know. And people like Anthony Fauci thought it would be beneficial for the world if he speaks with more certainty. But because of the political division that formed around that, that certainty resulted in, became completely counterproductive, that people didn't trust anything about the vaccine, didn't trust any institutions. There were, that contained the experts that actually knew what they were doing, and basically didn't trust anything that was coming out of the mouths of scientists, some large percent of the population. So that made you completely ineffective in, at scale, as a society trying to respond to a terrible pandemic. And that's where I put a lot of blame on leaders. So political leaders and scientific leaders are the ones that should inspire us to all get together and respond, and that should be the case for the pandemic, that should be the case in the time of war, all this kind of stuff.",

Part of it was, I mean, for me, I prefer accuracy rather than overconfidence. I would prefer, listen, we don't really know right now whether masks do X or Y. What we do know is the supply is really limited of this type of mask. We're gonna try to keep 'em for the frontline workers. I love that. That's the way I want to be communicated to. A call was made to do it differently, which was to say the masks don't actually help, but the real reason is they want to keep them for healthcare workers. And then later the masks are what's going to solve. I'm with you 100%. I think the other layer to it, is you can't ignore the political situation at the time. If Trump had won reelection, and the vaccine distribution had taken place while Trump was President rather than Biden, my belief is that the same number of Democrats would've gotten vaccinated, but way more Republicans would've as well, because they were following not science, but political leaders. And when it was Biden in DC instead of Trump, a lot of those people said, I don't trust the vaccine. But wait, it's Trump's vaccine, I thought. Yeah, but something about the way Biden's distributing it. So I do think you can't ignore that political layer. I agree with you, the communication was a disaster. - Let me ask you about Joe Biden. What are the strengths and weaknesses of Joe Biden? - Weaknesses, I think are some of the things you've identified. He is not seen as high energy. He is not the same Joe Biden that debated Paul Ryan in 2012 and ran circles around him, in just an incredible debate performance. He is not inspiring in the way that someone like a Barack Obama was to people coming up and starting to get interested in politics. I think a lot of those are fair criticisms. I think on policy, he's not interested in a lot of the things that younger voters are interested in.",

I know that there are counterpoints to what I'm saying, and those include that was the old Biden, the new Biden doesn't have it. That includes, that's just a sign of rot because he's been around for so long. Nobody should be around that long in politics. Perfectly reasonable criticisms to talk about. But I do see that as one of his strengths. And he also is good at knowing when he can work with Republicans, and when he can't, and not wasting more time than is sort of expected for posturing reasons. And I think that that's a good thing. - Do you think he's actually there, so in day-to-day operation of government, given his cognitive capabilities, do you think he is an active and practicing executive? - I don't know that I can say that it's because of what may be going on cognitively, but my sense from the people I talk to, is that he's very much involved in the highest level geopolitical, and big domestic economic stuff. But that a lot of the smaller issues that presidents might or might not be in sort of plugged into, that he's not plugged into the details of a lot of the lower level stuff. - Yeah, you could probably apply the same exact criticism even more so towards the Donald Trump administration in terms of being a practicing active executive who's paying attention. Like for example, like Vladimir Putin is somebody who loves the role of the executive, has a huge amount of meetings, is constantly tracking information about agriculture and all the different subsystems of government. Stalin, funny enough, was also extremely good at this. So certain people just love the job of being an executive.

That's pretty micro, you know, saying the weather channel's wrong. - I see what you did there. - [David] This is, okay. - I see what you did there. - So that's a micro, he went to Puerto Rico and he gave out paper towels after a hurricane.

But there's this unfortunate thing that when people are just asked, you think Biden's doing a good job?

I think our election system is part of why politics is the way it is, where you have two choices and it's first passed the post, and we have this electoral college so that depending on which state you vote in, the kind of meaning and significance of your vote is different. If you vote in Montana, it's the Republican candidate's going to win, and that changes the dynamics. I think that's part of it. I think that at a personal level, I've experienced this in my life a lot. We've become, and by we, I mean people in the United States to some degree who talk about this stuff, we've become uncomfortable when there is disagreement, and it bleeds over into now we can't have a normal interpersonal relationship anymore. I'm from Argentina, and in Argentina it's really common, even in my family, there are incredibly heated political debates, at the start, the middle, the end of some kind of gathering.

It's not even really performance, or rather than being simply performative for an audience that you have. - In terms of your motivations, do you see, do you worry about the effects of something we spoke of, spoke about offline with like the YouTube algorithm? Are you driven by the number of views your videos get, or are you driven by something else? - So in my world, I guess I would say, the number of views that any platform generates is a metric that I can choose how to interpret. I can choose to interpret it as, I've created content that's interesting to people, or I've created content that's really angering people, and that's why they're showing up, they don't actually like it, it's because they're angry or whatever else the case may be.",

        "text": "But it is true that there are algorithmic changes that can take place. Something happened in early January that affected us on YouTube, or there are periods on TikTok where you can tell, we're doing all the same things. Something has happened and then you never usually figure out what it is. So for me it's sort of just like a general tool to see what is the level of interest in what I'm doing, and are the numbers so out of whack, with what I would expect, that I should look into whether something deeper is happening. Has there been some change to an algorithm or whatever the case may be. I had a debate once with someone who accused me of using clickbait to generate views, and we had a really interesting conversation where I said, tell me really what you mean by that. Is your argument that I'm using titles that don't actually represent what's in the video? No, what's in the title is in the video. I go, okay, so it's not that the title is dishonest, are you saying I'm deliberately picking titles that will garner a larger audience? And they said, yeah, that's kind of what I mean. And I said, isn't that kind of what we're all doing? The alternative would be choosing titles to generate a smaller audience, which seems like a real kind of waste of time. So I'm trying to navigate and play the game in a way that's comfortable, but use the metrics more as a tool than as something to obsess over. - Nevertheless, the metrics are what they are in that they're able to affect your psyche. It's very difficult, which is why I have a Chrome extension that hides all the views and all that on YouTube for me. Is difficult not to let it affect how you think about ideas. So maybe your extensive exploration of a particular topic like healthcare, generated very few views, is it difficult for you to still care about healthcare? There's some aspect of the human mind that starts being affected by those views. And I think that's a really dangerous thing. Mostly it's probably beneficial, because it probably makes you a better presenter,",

I'm really worried about my own mind in that, so I run from that aggressively. - One of the things that I include in my overall approaches, I don't think about any one clip, I think about an entire show, or a week of shows, or a month of shows. And so it's less about does one clip do well. My view going in is, I'm going to do stuff that won't do that well, but I think it's really important to do, and I want to make it part of my show. And so when I did a clip with 10 ideas for reducing gun violence, I know that that's not gonna get 500,000 or a million views. I know it's just not going to. And the first day it'll get 12,000 and I'll go, I don't care, that's fine. There's a group of people in my audience that values this stuff, and I wanna keep doing this stuff. I'll end up surprised sometime. And two weeks later, it has 150,000 views because it started being shared, great. But I don't go into it thinking, these all need to be home runs by that metric. I always go in saying, I want to put out a diversity of content, including stuff that is less titillating and salacious, but is important to do, it's more researched, et cetera. And so that's the way I try to resist exactly what you're talking about. - And I think you have to probably know yourself. Like for me, metrics, I just like numbers too much. And for me, metrics do affect me. This is why I don't pay attention at all. Like I can't, I would love to hire somebody on the team who cares, 'cause we currently have folks who just, all of us just don't care.

And it's hard not to like-- - This is tough stuff. I mean yeah, I know exactly what you're saying. And part of it is, I mean it starts in my, you have a little bit of a different situation than me, because you're doing long form conversations with people, and the prep is a little bit different. One of the things in my space, because I'm reacting mostly to what's going on in the news and then also picking topics to dive into it a little bit more deeply, is I have very little control over the news cycle, and there is a meta metric or a macro metric that affects me, that will quadruple my audience, and then take 75% of it away, which is the seasonality of election cycles. And the first few election cycles, it's very tough, because I go, it's October, I'm like, at this rate we're gonna have 20 million subscribers by the next, these numbers are unbelievable.

Yeah, I don't find it super interesting. - Well, he also wrote the book, The Real Anthony Fauci, is that the name of the book? - Did he write that? That's, I don't know. I'm not sure about that.

You don't think so? Like this, it depends on your goals. If you're thinking of it as a historical event, yes, you should probably wait longer.

I'll tell you the pros and the cons as I see them. I do think that we have elected officials in the US, particularly presidents, from a really narrow range of backgrounds. So it's lawyers and sometimes business people, very, very often lawyers. I think we would benefit from a much greater diversity of backgrounds. And I once said, and that would include people from education, people from the science world, people with backgrounds maybe running nonprofits, et cetera.

It just means someone in a clinic told you you have depression. I don't believe that to be the case. I think we have an understanding, there's two types of depression. There's like a genetic predisposition depression, there's like a acute, something's happening in my life, temporary depression. You know, when she was asked about it recently, she said, \"I didn't mean it, \"I was just trying to impress Russell Brand.\" I don't know if I'm more bothered by the things she first said, or by the fact that she wanted to impress Russell Brand.

Now I wanna say one other thing about this. Anybody who wants to run should run. I am not suggesting there should be an uncontested primary for Joe Biden. Absolutely. - So you think he should be contested? - Well what I mean by contested is, so there's two parts to what we mean by contested. Will the DNC organize debates? And we'll get to that in a second, but should anybody who's on the left get out of the way because Joe Biden is President and he's running for reelection? Absolutely not. The question about should there be debates, I would like there to be debates. The DNC pretty clearly isn't going to organize them.

Do you have an understanding of this? - There's a lot of different answers to this. One aspect to this, which I think is more of a sociocultural thing, which I've recently read about to some degree, is the job actually turns off the people who would be best at it, because of what you need to do to become President. And it includes all but completely abandoning your existing day-to-day life job, which you may depend on, and family to some degree. It's horribly negative, as we already talked about. And at the end of all of that, you either lose and then have to rebuild, and maybe you're not in a position to be able to do that, or you win and then now you've got four years of being one of the most hated people, no matter how good a job you do. So I think by its nature it turns off a lot of people that would otherwise be good. I also think that there's a lot of posturing from within the parties about, well, you might be good but it's not your time yet, so you should wait. And then let's talk about maybe a Senate seat here and there. So it's like a company essentially, and they're figuring out where they wanna place people. I think all of these things make it so we end up with candidates most people aren't super thrilled with. - So it's difficult for somebody who's young or an outsider to quickly become a candidate. - I think that that's true, and I think also in a lot of ways it's just not, I mean, would you wanna be President? - No. - I mean I can't be 'cause I wasn't born in the US, so it's easy for me to say, but. - If everyone says no, then we're get the people that we have. - No, I understand that. - So I would love to help somehow. - [David] Sure. - And I feel like there's not even a mechanism for helping,",

And I think there's a good chance that some of the people in my audience are political hobbyists in the sense that they follow this stuff as entertainment to some degree. And I've written a lot about how, I've read a lot and talked a lot about how, okay, we vote every two years or every four years in our local elections, et cetera. And then we think about politics all the time. Neil Postman wrote about this in his book, Amusing Ourselves to Death. But what are you actually going to do about the kids starving in this country, and the nuclear buildup in that country? It's okay, if everybody refocused their attention on their immediate communities, and that could mean any number, it could mean the town or city you live in, or it might mean an athletic club or whatever. If everybody this time they spent on political hobbyism, they moved somewhere else, which might put me out of a job, that's okay.

Hopefully through the digital space, it would be. Let me ask you about on the Republican side, Ron DeSantis, what do you think of him as a candidate running against Donald Trump? - I think in the couple of weeks before our discussion today, his campaign, which hasn't even started, has sort of started to implode.

He responded in such a sort of disproportionate, unhinged way. During his recent trip to Asia, he was asked about why aren't you or why are you responding but in this weird way to Trump's attacks on you? And he went into this weird bobblehead thing with a weird smile, and something came out that didn't make any sense, and he sort of got mad at the reporter, and it was just like, if you can't handle that, you can't be on a debate stage with Donald Trump. And again, for all my criticisms of Trump, the guy gets you on a debate stage, he can make you look pretty silly. He was recently asked about his role at Guantanamo Bay when he was an officer in, I forget which branch of the armed forces. And he just sort of attacked the journalist asking the question, and it just looked very bad. And there are increasingly big Republican donors who are not fans of Trump and were sort of hoping to put their eggs in the Ron DeSantis basket who are saying, this guy just doesn't have what it takes, I don't think he can do it. So I don't know if DeSantis will be able to get away. Once you're polling 20 something like he is, and you haven't even announced, it's very attractive. And he probably to some degree is thinking, if I wait till 2028, I might not have this opportunity again. But Trump's polling 52, 53, which means even if DeSantis gets all of the current non-Trump vote, he has to figure out how to take something more from Trump. I just don't know how he does it. - First of all, the implosion aspect, that's part of the process, isn't it? You kind of implode a bunch of times. - [David] And then rebuild yourself. - And rebuild and because the new cycle kind of forgets. - It's possible.

I mean there are other people running. There's this guy, Vivek Ramaswamy who's running, Nikki Haley is running. Her campaign basically dead on arrival. Trump actually does better in polls the more people run. When it's just him and DeSantis, that's the best scenario for DeSantis. It's not great for DeSantis, but it's certainly better. But I think the difficulty is, this is a question for Republicans to figure out. The people who rightly recognized in 2016 that this guy is not good for their party, still believe this guy is not good for their party. But many of them recognize that most of the voters are still behind him. You can always say, it's early, his polling doesn't really mean anything. Anything could happen. Something major would have to happen for Trump to lose that lead, if he got more, if he was arrested two more times, and had more indictments, and it just became like this guy can't even campaign because he's so busy going from court to court. Maybe that would make a difference. It's really tough to imagine. - You said that there are three categories of people who vote Republican, and that Trump introduced the fourth one. Can you go through the four categories? - Sure. So you've got like your pro-business, low tax Republicans. These are mostly people like Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney has a bit of the social conservatism as well. He's Mormon and that's there. But Mitt Romney primarily, particularly as a northeast sort of Republican, I mean, I know Utah, but Governor of Massachusetts, he is like a low tax pro-business type guy. You've got your libertarian type Republicans who are primarily about freedom and liberty. Often they are actually more socially Liberal where they go, I don't care about gay marriage, Liberal, you know, I don't care so much about abortion.

Often they actually want Christianity, being civil government. They don't want separation of church and state. Those are traditionally the three Republican groups. The one that Trump introduced was people who just didn't really pay attention to politics, but either followed celebrity, or had grievances that they didn't yet have scapegoat for, and were sort of right-leaning culturally even though they didn't attribute that to Republicanism. And Trump was able to bring them into politics often for the first time as voters. They could be part of any of those three groups if they get more into politics or kind of be their own thing. But they're more kind of like cult of personality, I'm here for Trump types. - Did it have to do anything about the culture wars and the identity politics, all that kind of stuff? - Yeah, I mean, so in 2016 when Trump mobilized them, those weren't really issues the way they are now. So I think at that time, it certainly was not a factor. - What was the mobilizing issue? Was it just anti-Hillary in 2016? - He did a good job on anti-Hillary, but a lot of it was identifying real economic problems, wage depression, lack of jobs in parts of the country. You know, Ohio and Indiana, Trump rightly identified like we have an issue here, we don't have enough entrepreneurship, et cetera. But there was also a lot of scapegoating that was, you know, China and people coming through the US-Mexico border were popular scapegoats for a lot of those problems. This gets us kind of to populism. Populism is a rhetoric, and populism as a rhetoric doesn't necessarily come with particular policies.

Between voters, but like that's I guess what I was speaking to, but that hate was directed towards the narrative, the thread that connected all of that in 2016 was Hillary Clinton. - Few different things.

One is Hillary Clinton had been around in the political space for a long time, from her time as First Lady, through as Senator, Secretary of State, et cetera. So I think that there was enough time for different groups to develop an antipathy towards her for different reasons. So time. Secondly, Trump's branding of her as crooked was very effective, where there were so many people demanding that she be imprisoned. If you ask them what is the crime, they don't know.

        "text": "- [David] Okay, where do we start? - The conspiracy, so what are, in general, as a person who thinks about politics, thinks about this world, like where do conspiracy theories fit in for you? - I think there have been conspiracies, and by conspiracies, I'm using a colloquial definition, which is basically individuals working together to, in a clandestine way, impact or affect some kind of event or phenomenon very, very broadly. I mean, certainly that those things have happened. To pick, to jump around to some of the things that were in there, I think the reason that conspiracy theories are so compelling, is that it's really tough for a lot of people to accept there are random events, not predictable specifically. At a stochastic level, we might be able to predict them, but specifically unpredictable, bad events in many ways. I could be the victim of one, or you could, or my family could. That's really scary to a lot of people understandably so. And for some people it's less scary and more soothing in a way to say, there aren't really random events like this. Somebody planned it. And if we had just known who planned it, it just could have been stopped because we would've known exactly when. That's just a psychological level, easier to accept for people. And I get that to some degree, because listen, it's not the most exciting thing that everything can just be going fine and something absolutely horrible happens and kills, who knows, some number of people or. So I think that's the biggest at attractor to a lot of these conspiracy theories. It doesn't apply to all of 'em though. - But yeah, but there's still kind of a basic understanding of human nature where people, some people are greedy and want power, and are corrupted by power. So there's kind of these compelling narratives that stick that, I don't know, the vaccine is a opportunity for a powerful billionaire to implant chips into you so he can control you further. - [David] Right. - It doesn't seem, what do I want to say?",

So they do evil while trying to do good. And you can kind of imagine it. So it's like, why not? And you listen to people in power, authorities, they kind of look and sound shady, you know? Like the transparency, especially the older ones. I think younger folks are better at being like real and transparent, and just like revealing their flaws and the basic humanity. But people that are a little bit older, in the positions of power, they're more polished. They're more like, it feels like they're presenting a narrative, what the truth is hidden in the shadows. - I don't think there's anything wrong with suspecting, maybe a public figure isn't giving me the full story. Totally reasonable thing to question. I don't think there's anything wrong with exploring a lot of these different things. I think the problem becomes, and I know you've talked about this in so many different ways with other guests, the problem becomes when we lose a shared understanding of how we would assess whether any of these things are true, and then both alleged evidence and then absence of evidence, both become supportive of the conspiracy theory. Because if there's bad evidence, you manipulate it and say it's good evidence. If there's no evidence, you say the evidence was obviously hidden by the people who carried out the thing or whatever. So unless we can have a shared understanding of how we would determine what's true, these are common conversations often between atheists and religious folks. How can we deter, like, is my faith in something or my desire for something to be true a good way to evaluate whether it is true? They're really similar questions. - Well, let me ask you about Trump on that front,",

Because we have not only the event, that's clever actually. It's not only the event, but it's what led up to it, and what has happened since, and did it change what is considered on the table that citizens can, should or might do if they disagree with the results of an election? So I think that there are further reaching consequences than just the six hour period on January 6th, a bigger or smaller deal than the Civil War? And there's so much wrapped up into it. Many conspiracy theories flowed from January 6th as well. 60 Minutes recently featured a guy named Ray Epps who was targeted by some on the right, claiming that he was an instigator or an agent of the FBI or something along those lines. There were people claiming that no real it was like a No True Scotsman sort of thing. Like Trump supporters wouldn't riot, so by definition it must have been Antifa, police let 'em in, or police were, you know, all these different things. I think it was a big deal in a lot of ways because it completely made us have to go back to the top to say, okay, what are the parameters of valid discussion and activism in the United States? - But what aspect of the January 6th was bad for you? - [David] Well, I mean. - If you're thinking of from a big philosophical, political perspective, so presumably the number of people hurt and the number of people who died is not the only metric to consider here. - Absolutely.

Trump's already saying they're gonna cheat with mail-in ballots, or they're gonna cheat with early voting, or they're gonna cheat with machines, or we should do only in person or whatever else the case may be. We have the election. We knew in certain states how the vote count was going to go. Some states stopped counting at 10:00 PM, some states count all of the mail-in stuff up front, some don't. Everything was completely predictable. At 2:00 AM, Trump comes out and says, I won. Okay, but where are you getting that, Sir, as he claims people always refer to him, where are you getting that? And with that statement, immediately we see that there is a large portion of this country that either is unable or unwilling to say, wait a second, the polling all said this was a real possibility. The counting schedules are all being adhered to, but Trump won? That doesn't make any sense. That doesn't happen. It builds. People are donating millions to Trump for supposed audits, which nobody can define, and lawsuits which go nowhere. And it builds and builds and builds.

I think there's still a case to be made that that did not leave the realm of protest, versus a violation of the principles of democracy. So to me, the height of what could happen on January 6th, is if Donald Trump was much better executive, he could take control of the military. - [David] If it had succeeded. - No, not even succeeded. The attempt would've been more empowered. - [David] I understand. - So like, the way not to bring up Hitler every other word, which is something your subreddit had also told me not to do. - [David] Okay. - He's kind of an important figure and it's interesting to study that moment in history 'cause it reveals so much about human nature, and that all of us are capable of good and evil.

Do you think there would be more and more questioning of the election results? - There has been already. It's very clearly the playbook. Kari Lake lost, she ran for Governor in Arizona 2022, she lost. What I mean by that is her opponent received more votes. It's like very clear what it means that she lost.

It is, it's extraordinarily saddening, but it seems like this is now going to be part of the playbook. - Do you think people on the left will start doing it? - I don't have a reason to believe that that is going to happen, but I'm not going to say it never could.

The ability to hack elections is becoming more and more effective with the developments on the artificial intelligence side. - The difficulty is you're basically saying, will something happen without me knowing anything about the election? Imagine there really was evidence of a hacked election, then I would want those claims to be made. But the way elections have gone in the past, I don't expect that that's a claim that would be made, no. - Speaking of evidence of things that were claimed, what do you think about the Hunter Biden laptop, or as you tweeted, The Laptop From Hell TM. - [David] Right. - To what degree was this laptop story important and to what degree was it not? - At this point, I have said many times, if there is any reason to believe that Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, Naomi Biden, Jill Biden, Hillary, Obama, Doug, if there's any evidence any of them committed a crime, they should be investigated, they should be charged, and they should be tried, period. The Hunter Biden laptop thing has been floating around for so long, and we still have zero actual pieces of evidence of any crime, particularly involving Joe Biden. There's the claim from some that references to the big guy, are about Joe Biden getting 10% for some illicit, it's been years they've been saying this, they've not been able to bring forward any evidence on it. So my assessment of the Hunter Biden laptop is, it seems to mostly be a story about nude images released without someone's consent, which is illegal in most states, and violates Twitter's own policies. That's the main story to me. Beyond that, I don't know how many people have a copy of this hard drive at this point. Rudy had it. Tucker, do you remember when Tucker, this is unbelievable.

But it's getting, it's almost getting satirical, the degree to which they're talking about the Hunter Biden laptop. - Well what do you think about the social media aspect of this, that story got censored, and what do you think about censorship in general on social media that that story during an important time in the electoral process got censored? - So I, as a matter of principle, I think we have to define what we mean by censorship. But I'm against censorship, short of illegal content, I guess is the way I would put it. I do respect a company's right to have terms of service and to enforce them as long as they're not illegal. If Twitter were to say, we don't publish content from Jewish people. Okay, now we've got a problem on our hands. But what is dubious to me is the claim that had people been able to see Hunter Biden's genitals, they would've voted for Trump. Which I know it's like, David, you're making light of- And, but at the end of the day, what exactly is the claim that if you had known more about Hunter Biden, I guess allegedly hiring prostitutes and having a drug problem and seeing pictures, you wouldn't have voted for Joe Biden? I mean, I know me as a voter, I don't feel that way. - I think it's less about the content of the story and about the actions of a social media company to control what you see and what you don't see. So you could imagine a social media company like Facebook and Twitter making the same kind of decision about a more impactful story than a few dick pics on a laptop. - Well, I think if that happened, then my view might be different, right?

Is it representative of some big shift that's happening in mainstream media? - What would the shift be? - Basically, mainstream media freaking out because the funding is getting less and less and less and less. And there's gonna give more power to individual commentators, basically Tucker Carlson just starting a podcast, and a YouTube channel. - I think that's what he should do. I think that's the most profitable path rather than maybe going to work for Newsmax or whatever the case may be. But the firing fundamentally was not a politically oriented firing that suggests Fox News is changing its tune politically in any way. There's no evidence of that whatsoever. Tucker Carlson basically became a legal problem for Fox News. There's really four points to it. One is the $787 and a half million settlement with Dominion partially was because of the claims that went out on Tucker Carlson's program. So to some degree, Tucker's program was a prominent node of the problematic claims that became the subject of the lawsuit. That's number one. Number two, Smartmatic, which is another voting machine company, still has a similarly sized lawsuit against Fox News, based on the exact same sorts of claims. It may cost Fox News again.

So to me, Tucker's firing was a risk mitigation strategy of many that will be employed as these lawsuits come forward. There's no evidence that it's because Fox didn't like, and what we mean by that, who are we talking about? Rupert Murdoch doesn't like, or the, I don't know. But I don't have any reason to believe it's because Tucker's ideas were no longer welcome on Fox. Certainly the audience liked them. - So interesting, it's not about, it's not even about the ratings, it's about just the legal costs. - Fox is interesting, the ratings question is interesting, because Fox, unlike most other or every other cable news channel, they negotiate a fee from every cable subscriber. If you have Fox News as a channel, even if you don't watch it, Fox gets a little bit of money. They are dramatically less dependent on ad revenue than CNN and MSNBC. So the ratings question is an interesting one, but Fox's position is different on that. - Another question from Reddit. \"Both sides are the same\", in quotes, is a meme notion that has spread far and wide in American political discourse on the internet.

Russell Brand, Joe Rogan and George Carlin claim that-- - [David] Say both sides the same. - The same, and use that, you know, all politicians are crooked, and they suck, and this kind of thing.

And I find that it's one of the lamest and most kind of cringe-inducing things to hear because of the what comes next. And usually what comes next is not a good accurate criticism of something that took place, and a discussion of how to solve a real problem that we have. I find it a conversation stifler. It also is used to kind of suppress voter turnout. Not actively, it's not that the people who say that go around saying don't vote. But the idea of course is the more people that believe that it doesn't really make a difference who you vote for, it's going to suppress voter turnout.

Okay, we have new polling that seems to suggest so-called wokeism is kind of more popular in the United States than anti-wokeism. And I'll tell you what I mean by that. This is the less interesting part, we'll go to the more interesting part in a second. Sometimes what people mean by wokeism is an overreaction to a perceived injustice that goes beyond what would be fair and equitable. There was this really interesting poll and it asked questions like, for example, do you believe society has gone too far, not far enough, or just about the right amount in dealing with issues affecting the trans community? The woke position, which is society hasn't gone far enough, was far more popular than we've gone too far. Now the right wing media narrative is we've gone way too far, this is out of control. And there are lots of other similar answers. It's not a huge margin. A lot of these are like 58 to 42, 60 to 40. It's not like 90 to 10. But by a small margin, the so-called woke perspective, of we actually haven't yet done enough to fix some of these issues is a little bit more popular. So if we went back to DeSantis, this is part of why I think DeSantis is anti-woke agenda may just be a political misstep. - That's a really interesting result. I wonder how the questions are framed, but it's still interesting, nevertheless, no matter what to hear that, people are, majority of people in America are woke, not in the negative sense of the word. - The poll didn't use the term woke. - [Lex] Right. - This is a critical thing. - [Lex] Let's use the term woke positively. - The term has kind of been perverted.

But now let me get to, like to what degree do I think that actual, when it goes too far is a problem? It absolutely exists. We can find instances of where this exists on the left. I've been told many times that as a Jewish Argentinian immigrant to the United States, I actually don't qualify as oppressed enough because Jews are privileged now in the US, and my family had just enough money to leave Argentine. So there's this kind of like oppression Olympics thing where I've been told you don't get to comment, for example, like a topic in the Latino community now is, are you familiar with Latinx? Okay, in Spanish, there's an analogous movement where words by their nature sort of like have a gender. So like the word for friend is amigo, but if it's a woman, you would say amiga. So right from there, you can tell the gender that we're talking about. And if it's a mixed group, you say amigos, it's the male with an S, but it could include both. There's a movement now which wants to do away with that and put the letter E in. It's a new word, okay? It's a gender neutral word. Amiges, totally new. I don't like that. And I don't know anyone, no one in my family uses it. And I think it's kind of like a strange imposition from someone kind of with a solution in search of a problem.",

I'm fine, I'm surviving fine, but I'm being bullied over it and disqualified, and saying, you don't get to speak on this issue. All of those example, all of that stuff I am completely against.

I just don't think it's as big as some others believe. - You don't think it's an existential threat to our civilization in the west, to west civilization? - No, I don't. And I mean, look, we've got a Biden administration, I see Biden as center left. Those who see Biden as extreme far left, this stuff has played almost no role whatsoever in the first two plus years of his administration. - There's people that see him as far left? - There's people on the right who, I mean, Trump says Biden's a Marxist Socialist Communist. - I haven't heard that because I don't think that would stick very much. - He said that at every rally, yeah. I'm so jealous that you don't watch these things. - I love how deeply researched you are in Trump. I can only imagine how good your Trump impression is at this point. - [David] It's not very, sadly, it's not good. - It's not, all right. - No, but, and I'll say one other thing on that. You know, take trans, because trans, just to talk about it a little bit, we haven't dealt with it much. The trans issue has become huge, I believe because the right is obsessed with it. The right is very much not concerned with gay men anymore. It used to be that gay men, it's like, oh, we have to stop gay men from adopting, and unnatural, and pedophiles. Now it's trans, it's drag shows, et cetera. I do think that there is a fair question to say, how do we deal with trans women in a very small short list of sports? That's real, okay?",

You can eliminate from that, trans men, nobody's worried, right, about women, biological women who are trans. And then when you say, it's only in certain sports that it matters. Hey, I'm right there. I think it's a complicated question. I don't know how we deal with it. I would ask leagues that have experienced with this already and whatever. The problem I have is pretending that the vanguard of left wing politics right now is trying to force trans women into sports. It's like, it's just not the big issue that the right is reacting as if it were. - But perhaps because of the right, it's forcing the left to continue discussing it. I mean, I feel like it, even in institutions, even at universities, it feels like these ideas of diversity, inclusion, and equity are taking some of the air out of the room of what a university should also care about, which is merit. And it feels like reprioritization is going a little too far the other way, meaning prioritizing this kind of amorphous concept of diversity is moving away, is giving power to people that don't care about merit and are just wanna bully people with a big stick that says racism, or sexism, or anti-diversity. And it kind of suffocates the people that care about merit, about meritocracy, about inspiring people from all kinds of backgrounds to succeed. And it's just, you kind of observe that. I'm sure that happens in all kinds of institutions. And the concern, I think the people that are concerned about wokeism are concerned about at scale, what impact does that have on a society, when there's so much conversation about racism, and a pressure not to talk about merit. Like who's the actual good person in the room, the best person in the room? - Generically, that's a concern to me. The degree to which it's happening at different institutions",

There are problems with a perfect meritocracy. I think what we want to do is generate roughly equal opportunity for people, understanding that there is going to be an outcome on a gradient or a bell curve, allowing people generally speaking, to determine the path that they want to take and giving them, if it's possible, the ability to pursue that without suppressing, limiting.

Sometimes people blow stuff out of the proportion. But it's hard to measure how much self-censorship happens at university campuses. It's hard. - That's true. I think also it's sort of like the pitbull bite stories thing, where when a pitbull bites a person, it's more likely to be reported on because it fits a certain narrative. And there are right wing publications that are very interested in making this seem as if it is an epidemic. I'm the first to say it is happening to a degree.

If there's any positive change to come from a changing dynamic with higher education, I wish it would be to go in that direction. - Well, no ChatGPT is actually much better at helping me think than any educator, even books that I've encountered. Because it's very good at presenting the full picture, even better than a lot of Wikipedia articles, you know, on questions like, did the virus leak from a lab, did the COVID leak from a lab?

And if there's a conflict between two of these private security companies, then I don't know, you figure it out somehow. - [David] So it's almost like anarchism, so take it to that degree. - Yeah, if by, I don't know what the question means by that American style libertarianism. But in general my problems with libertarianism as it is often presented, come from the work of sociology as well as human psychology. Which is the reality that once you get a group that's bigger than 150 people, you really have to start centralizing some decisions. Unless you're gonna subdivide the 150 endlessly into 275s that now no longer have contact, but then that's not really one society, now it's two. I've not seen good evidence. And I've read a fair bit about this, that once you get beyond 150, you can keep all decisions decentralized. And once you say some things need to be centralized, then it's a matter of how you do it. And it's going to be some version of government that conflicts with aspects of libertarianism. - Well it could be companies, right? It could be more market-driven, which is the idea of anarchism that you're not, you don't give any centralized entity a monopoly over violence. You know, and then if you think that the markets are efficient at delivering, especially in this 21st century and beyond, where a market could have perfect information about people. So one of the issues is that you can manipulate markets because there's not perfect information. But now in a digital age, we can be higher bandwidth participants in the market. So if you're choosing between different security companies, are you choosing between different providers and different services, you could do so more efficiently and more effectively in the digital space.",

And whether you say that it's a company that's solving it or a government, the problems are going to be very similar.

And I would tell him, I stand by everything I said about what you said, and I would say it to you right now. There are people who write to me and go, oh man, things must be really, really tense now. If you were to, Rogan would never have you on because you disagreed, and it's like-- - [Lex] He loves you. - I'm sure he's just not thinking of me. I'm not the most important thing to Joe Rogan. I think both of us would be able to sit down and talk about every one of my criticisms. It would not be taken personally, and then we would move on and it would be the next day. - You get attacked a lot. How do you not let that break you mentally? - Oof, I don't know. So let's see. I try to, I mean, I'm in a toxic space. The news in politics, partisan news in politics, partisan news in politics on the internet with a social media component, just completely and totally toxic.

I don't need to read every comment. I don't need to look at every email or every tweet. I have 15 minutes each day where I go through my social media platforms, look at generally what has the reaction been, maybe include that in my assessment of how I want to tackle a certain issue if I missed a good point or something like that, and basically try to move on. When something like we talked about at the beginning happens, it becomes obsessive. I mean, it's unhealthy, right? Where I'm going, oh my God, who's attacking me now, and scrolling? It becomes, you know, I'm sweating, it's horrible. But I think just like limiting exposure to that, and remembering that it is impossible to please everybody. And so I'd really rather have fresh, genuine views each day rather than views that are sort of like restricted and flattened by what I perceive to be people's preferences. - So just can you speak a little more to the full process of creating the David Pakman Show? Like what, you wake up because you're doing five shows a week? - I have the Letterman schedule, which means I do five shows in four days. I shoot Monday to Thursday, but we're doing five episodes. Basically our guests, we schedule in advance. I'm picking six to eight stories each day that are, like I said, a blend of stuff I think will be interesting, things I want to talk about, and things where there's, it's being discussed at one layer and I want to go deeper on it, and I feel like I'm able to do that. I choose those stories in the morning, record in the early afternoon, and we put the show out by that afternoon. - What's the preparation, what's the, how do you take notes? Are you on a sheet of paper? - No sheets of paper anymore. I used to do sheets of paper. I found something about it, like at work, the tactile nature of it.",

So we can have pages for every guest, every topic. - [David] Oh, that's interesting, I haven't heard that. - Yeah, I don't know anyone else who's using it. It works really well. It's so fast and it takes up almost no space. So it just is a really good tool. When my team, you know, when we book a guest and they have notes from the publicist, they'll put it in there, and then I can access it. So I'm basically working off of notes rather than a script. I'll pull any audio visual stuff that I want so that that's available. And it's, I mean it's really a very seamless, you know, we're doing this every day, four days a week. And so we have it down to a well oiled machine. - Where do you get ideas from? - Everywhere. I have a bunch of subreddits that I follow that I think are talking about interesting things. I have a curated list for which I still use Twitter, and it is very good for this. It's a curated private list of journalists that I think are doing interesting work. So I'll see what's there. Look at the sort of standard news reporting wire services, AP and Reuters. Glance at what everything from Drudge, to CNN, to whoever is covering that day. Look at Google News. - How do you try to fact check stuff on your show? So like is there sources or is there a process? - I always try to get to a primary source first and foremost for the facts of the story. And then I'll use other tools for background research. Oftentimes Wikipedia's footnotes, I find to be useful tools. ChatGPT is a good one. You really have to fact check it, but it'll give you ideas of where to do the fact checking, which I think is fantastic. Sometimes it gives me information that's flat out wrong, and when you ask for the source, it's like, oh yeah, that actually is not real, which is, hey, it's part of the process.

Do you think it's becoming more and more difficult to know what is true, and will become continuously, continue to get more difficult, especially with GPT? - I think the big difficulty is in getting people to agree as to what is a statement of fact and what is a statement of opinion. I think once we can do that, reasonable people can more or less agree on how to get to the truth. Or if we can't get to it, at least figure out how we would if the information were available. But the bigger challenge I'm having is, someone will call in with an opinion, but say they want to talk about fact, and I have to explain to them, you're talking about an opinion and not a fact. And this goes back to the lack of critical thinking and lack of media literacy. But that's the bigger challenge for me right now. - But I mean, I think the big statements are always gonna be somewhat opinions. Like was the 2020 election fair? I think any answer to that is an opinion. - [David] I disagree. If we define fair. - Well, yes, so then I don't think it's possible to define fair in a way that's not several paragraphs where each sentence it now has facts, right? So you what do you mean by fair? Is it who could show up to vote? What was the process of how easy it is to vote? Was there actual cheating going on in different, like what is the evidence of that cheating? You have to actually get to the actual like details of a thing. High level, you know, everything is just going to be an opinion it feels like. And you can approximate that to be, like it's a well-founded opinion. Well, most of science is an opinion, even physics is an opinion. So like, I think there's a threshold beyond which an opinion becomes like, uh, this is a pretty reliable thing",

So I think maybe better said, I think that the difficulty, I mean, the process you described is probably the right process, and is it's exhausting for mundane things. And that causes major problems. If we were to say, is it better for the economy to have a tax rate on people making over a million dollars, that's 20% or 50%. Okay, what do we mean by better for the economy? It's not an overwhelming task to decide on that. We could say, well, we'll say it's better for the economy by looking at what was the unemployment rate based on the tax rate on million, you know, people earning a million a year, and what was GDP and whatever. Okay, we've agreed. This is a statement, we are now in the realm of just determining what is given the parameters that we've established. I think that that's relatively doable. The issue is with the bigger ones, like you're talking about, where what do we mean by a fair election, and fair in whose eyes? And I am with you that it often devolves into a conversation about opinions about what is fair, rather than an ascertainment of the facts. - Yeah, and it feels like maybe avoiding some of these big, maybe there's some trigger words too, maybe avoiding them allows you to actually talk about the facts, and through that, educate yourself and learn about, like whether the virus leaked from a lab or not. To me, it was always a super interesting question. I don't know why everybody got super touchy about it. Mostly people I know, colleagues, biologists thought it's pretty good likelihood that it leaked from a lab given everything. They just didn't, the evidence is not there for either one. And so like you should be able to just openly talk about it unless you're in a high political office where there could be geopolitical consequences to your statements. But in general, it's an interesting question. You should be able to talk about it, but there's no, first of all,",

Like it really, you think it shouldn't. One of the really good opening questions that I've had work to my advantage when talking with people who I know disagree with me about a contentious topic, is how do you think we would figure out X? And it often gets people thinking first collaboratively, and obviously we might have very different opinions, but with something like the COVID lab leak, I think it's an interesting one because if you say, okay, maybe it leaked, maybe it didn't, how would we figure that out? Who would we trust to weigh in on that? What evidence would count? Now we're kind of on the same team, and then if we can establish that, then we're on a search for capital T truth together or whatever. It's kind of pie in the sky, but in some conversations, I've actually had success with that. - And then you can kind of realize, if there's no amount of evidence that's gonna prove, show to you that you're wrong in your current opinion, that that's probably a really bad sign for you. - It may be a waste to pursue the conversation further at that point. Yeah, I mean, yeah, what, oh, so okay, you think Trump was a good President. How do you determine that and what evidence might exist that would change your mind? There is no evidence. Trump was the best President ever. I think the conversation's probably done. - [Lex] Except Abraham Lincoln. - Right. - You mentioned Israel Palestine.

I just don't think that some of the, kind of black and white characterizations about Israel are even remotely accurate. And I think most people, it's become a sort of litmus test. Are you criticizing Israel enough? Are you showing us that you're actually left wing? I don't do any of that stuff. I really look at the situation for what it is. - That's become a litmus test in American politics, in the spectrum of American politics. - Yes. My view big picture, is that I don't think we're going to really get anywhere until some pre-negotiated terms are set, and the parties to do the negotiating are all good faith parties. For example, I don't think Israel's right wing party, Likud, is a particularly good faith arbiter of peace, because I think Likud benefits from there not being peace, and the threat of violence. And there is violence, it's not just the threat of violence. I don't think Hamas is going to be an arbiter of peace for the Palestinian people either. I think the Palestinian authority is a question mark, I'm not sure. So I think that there need to be some preconditions that would need to be set with regard to everything from settlements, to, you know, a lot of this minutia. Big picture though, if I imagine what the most likely solution looks like, it doesn't mean it's a perfect solution. And obviously it's a solution, many people will say it's not going to happen. I think it's a solution where the borders are similar to what was being discussed in the Clinton era to some degree, as many of the settlements as possible have to go, understanding that some of the bigger ones are just not going to go and there's gonna have to be meaningful land swaps",

You know, I mean like we can go as kind of as far as we want to with a lot of this stuff. - What role does us have to play in this, coming to the table with good faith parties? - I don't know whether the, I go back and forth between believing that the US should play a big role, to the US should play essentially no role whatsoever, because of course of the funding of Israel that the US provides. It's not that I have a personal problem with American involvement, and somebody like Bill Clinton was arguably relatively well positioned to try to make something happen. It's more just will there, will it be seen as credible on the global stage? And that's, I think, the most important thing, because at the end of whatever negotiation takes place, both sides need to agree that this is where we are renouncing all past claims. And in the future, if there's a disagreement, we can't go back to that thing from the '80s or the '90s.

My view as a general observer of geopolitics and the way that this area, this part of the world has related to American presidents over the last several, you know, cycles, is I don't think it's controversial to say that this was a war of aggression, an invasion of aggression, an act of aggression by Vladimir Putin.

It doesn't feel like that latter is super likely, the former, there's reports about his health, I don't know how accurate they are. It's just hard to imagine a face-saving exit that is going to be even remotely, what's the word? It's not even a question of acceptable, just, it's not satisfying either.

I mean, to some degree it requires Russian troops leaving Ukraine, and that is somewhat under the control. I mean, of course it's not up to Ukraine whether the initiative continues, but what I am not thrilled with are some of the reflexive, you know, if Trump had been in power instead of Joe Biden, a lot of the reflexive comments about, oh, if you say Ukraine is just acting defensively, you're supporting neo-Nazis, or some of these things that have come out of the American Republican Party seem both wacky, and like they would be saying completely different things if Trump happened to be in the Oval Office. They're really proxy attacks on Joe Biden. - Yeah. Well that in some sense, Ukraine is also kind of political litmus tests of how you speak about it.

As a redditor put it, is it a necessary evil in the game of geopolitics? - I used to have what I now believe is an extremely naive perspective, which is that if we somehow, if intelligent aliens arrived here, it would be so momentous for homosapiens, that all of our differences would immediately be exposed to so insignificant. We would never fight again, and we would realize that intelligent life. And then I spoke to people who deal in space exploration and other scientists, and they all said, David, that's extraordinarily naive. There would be a period during which this was as momentous as you're imagining, and then it would become normal. And then we would go back to many of the same conflicts that we have now, sectarian, et cetera.

So I don't want to mischaracterize any of it. - In general, Americans are sold the view that we're the good guys spreading freedom across the world. And I know Chomsky takes a perspective that, yeah, but if you look at the number of civilians you kill while doing it, it's incomparable to any other military actions across the world. - Right, so I very much disagree with those who take the view that the US is this wonderful global police force that's spreading democracy and fixing problems. Very, very much wrong. I think where I've had disagreements with Chomsky in the past is more, he seems to frame the US as a uniquely bad actor in some of these cases. And I think it's more an outcropping of the size and wealth of the US, and less about uniquely negative intentions. And so I think that would be my general disagreement with Chomsky based on stuff I read a decade ago. - Well, he says that he lives in the United States, he's an American. And so he feels his focus of criticism should be on America.

Rise and Fall of the Third Reich I've read twice now, and I recommend. - [David] What did you get out of reading it the second time? - So what I, so the second time I listened to the audiobook as I ran. I get the same thing from it, as I get maybe reading Man's Search for Meaning, which is all the troubles of day-to-day in the modern world kind of fade away and dissipate when I'm thinking about the, you know, basically the embodiment of evil at scale at that recent time in human history. So it makes me sort of appreciate all the, it fills me with gratitude to have all the freedoms, all the just simple joys of life that we have today.

You start to pick up little details as opposed to like big things. You start to pick up the little quirks of how history turns, and just like these little events. You notice of the dynamics between people in a room during a meeting with Hitler. You just notice these little things that are mentioned, 'cause like he was either there directly or hurted the next day. So you get, that's why to me, Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is interesting is 'cause it's by a guy who was there, who's reporting on it, versus a sort of a more distant displaced retaliant. And I also like biographies. I'm a big fan of biographies. And Walter Isaacson has just written some incredible ones, and Steve Jobs, and Einstein, all that kind of stuff. - Viktor Frankl's book is one I've read a bunch of times. And it's so short.

The thing I was being mocked for is reading Dostoevsky, reading stuff that sounds like a high school reading list. - [David] Oh I see. - Or all these kinds of aspects of the reading list, which doesn't stand up to any sort of legitimate kind of criticism. But the fact that people are just looking for single words or single aspects of a tweet and so on to criticize is, it actually forced me to, 'cause I released a video about,",

They kind of ruin the fun of sharing with others. - I know exactly what you're talking about. My advice on that is don't do it. Just don't record it. Because, and is that what you basically. - Yeah, for now, but I think time cures it. But for now I decide not to. - [David] Yes. - It's just, until I feel joy when I do it. - We are in such a privileged position to even be able to do this sort of thing, right? I have taken on projects, and then it sort of sounds good, or I end up doing it because there's some third party that brings the idea, and I feel like I can't really say no or whatever. And then when I get in front of the camera, or I have to write something, for a while, I did a newspaper column that I hated doing. I realized that I'm ruining the exact thing that I have worked to build, which is that I can just do whatever I want. Why am I doing this? And sometimes it takes me a week to realize it, sometimes it takes me a year. But just don't do it, that's the path. - In this case in particular, it's also the, there's a private thing I enjoy, which is reading. - [David] Right. - And if sharing that private thing you enjoy is not fun, then just don't share it. That's, yeah. There's certain things, there's certain private things that should remain private. That's like, which is one of the first things ever. I'm the same person privately as I am publicly. But the books, it's like, man, I don't get to share, I guess through these conversations I can, I share some of the stuff I'm reading and enjoying it, 'cause it sucks. It sucks to get attacked for stuff, and it sucks to get attacked for stuff you love. - Yeah, especially reading. I mean it's, you know, that's the bottom of the barrel. I have these ideas where I'll go, you know, maybe for my next thing,",

And then I go, wait a second, I like traveling and just hanging out. Now traveling is gonna be my job, and now I've gotta bring two cameras with me, and I've gotta get shots and I've gotta film my food. And I'm not gonna do that. I'm just gonna do what I'm doing, but then I'll travel when I want to take a vacation. - And of course some of it could be fun. I mean, I have to say, when I did the one video on a book, 1984, I really enjoyed it. That whole process, it was fun. It was, I don't think I've ever thought as hard about a book when I had to make a video about it. 'Cause I had to like, you know, I read 1984, I don't know how many times. Probably five, 10 times, I don't remember. I read Animal Farm way more. But I don't think I was like, what do I think about like, what are the key takeaways for me? I didn't really know. Like if you asked me what I think about even Animal Farm, 'cause I haven't done that one, and I've read that one, I don't know, over 50 times. It's probably my favorite book. Is like, I would have to struggle. And making a video about it, basically a little mini lecture, forced me to actually have an opinion about the details of it, and to do enough research to think like, okay, what is the historical context of this book? I mean, it allowed me to say interesting, and to think interesting stuff about the book. I found it to be really rewarding to basically the old Feynman thing, one of the best ways to learn is to teach, right? - Yeah, I can't think of one thing I would say about Animal Farm, and I read it again not that long ago, but I don't know what comments are. - You kind of have a generic comment, about like authoritarianism and so on, whatever. But there could be interesting quirks of the book, and the characters and how corruption happens. You could say all kinds of stuff",

Like even with 1984, it allowed me to contrast with Brave New World, and how that 1984 was politicized, and how it's used by the Republican Party after day. Like you could say a lot of interesting stuff if you like, think about it, and write it down on a sheet of paper, maybe you don't need to make a video about it. So I found it to be really rewarding in general. So I probably will do more of it, but not always. Not as a main profession, just like with the travel blogging. - I agree with that. - I mean, you get threatened a lot, you get attacked a lot online. Do you think about your mortality? - Well, the other day I went to the doctor, and he said, you know, next physical, we're gonna be talking about a lot of new things. And so I was thinking about it a lot that day. No, I mean it's funny, I like, I recently did a bunch of estate stuff. - [Lex] Yeah. - And when you have intellectual property, there's a question of like, okay, I have my assets. But also if I died tomorrow, especially in a particularly fiery death, my YouTube channel would probably for a while generate more money, because it would be like, oh my goodness, this person died in a terrible. What happens with a future revenue stream and all these different things? And it got me thinking about legacy, and about the fact that people who do this sort of thing, it's kind of a new thing in a sense. And so, you know, if you work at ABC News, at some point you just retire and someone else fills in for you. How does my career wind down given like I don't actually know the answer. I'm not sure. What is it, I just one day stop posting videos, but all my content stays up getting fewer and fewer views. Or do I delete everything? Do I, I don't know. What is-- - If you die, I mean, so my trip to Ukraine, 'cause I knew I was going to the front,",

And so like there's a closure. - [David] Yeah. - But it's an interesting process. Like what happens to your, at which point does GPT take over and continue tweeting for David Pakman, you know? - Well, the tweeting I care less about right now, unless Blue becomes something unbelievable, I'm less worried about Twitter. But some of my audience members have been saying, you know, some of these tools, David, are getting good enough, that we could clone your voice and also make it match video. And with scripts, you could just keep pumping out content even if you were gone. And I said, now that I'm interested in, that I wanna learn more about. - Boy, it's gonna be a weird future. What advice do you have to young folks that are facing this future? - Almost always, it's some version of start right away. And that applies in so many different ways. So if you're thinking about, oftentimes the context is people want to do what I do. And I always say, do not sit around for a year thinking about lighting. This is how you never do anything. And dozens of people who I've felt obligated to talk to on the phone because of a personal connection, I go through all the advice, and I can tell they're not gonna do it. They just, it's already sounding too complicated. And so instead they'll sort of say, well, I gotta get the right lighting in the right room and blah, blah, blah, blah. The best thing you can do, no matter what you're doing, is just start right away. And that applies in this business and in whatever else you're doing. If you wanna learn a new thing, find a new hobby. The ability to get data right away about what's working, what's not working, and whether you even like this approach that you're taking is so valuable. And it will allow you to iterate. And the sooner you do it, the cost to a change of direction will also be lower. If there's any, I don't do like self-help or generic advice type stuff,",

I figured out I don't actually wanna do it. - Yeah, hence iterate. Well usually you'll discover you do. You think we'll make it out of the century, humanity, human civilization? - Out of the, so like to 2100? - Yeah, how much we got? 80 years. - Yeah, 77. I think we're gonna make it. - You think so? - [David] Yeah. - What are the biggest threats facing our civilization, if not wokeism? - If it's not wokeism, it's hard to say. No. I actually think that if you believe that we are on an inflection point of sorts in changes to society and acceleration of technology, et cetera, I think it's really tough to know in 2090 what will actually be the biggest threat. So, I don't know, it's so cliche to say nuclear, and climate change, and another pandemic. - Technologically our world might look so different than it's almost-- - [David] Yes, yes. - Unimaginable. What it means to be human is unimaginable. And also the degree that we make progress out into space is also unimaginable. - I think space is super interesting, and there's people on both the left and right who for different reasons are kind of not into the whole space exploration thing. The people I hear from, the ones on the right think it's just kind of dumb. The ones on the left think it's an excuse not to fix problems here. I think-- - And also they say it's the play thing of billionaires. - [David] Sure. - Which is another funny kind of concept. - Yeah, I mean, someone's gotta pay for it. Why not be people who have a lot of money to blow. - It could either be billionaires",

For me, it's not one or the other. And I recently read a long piece about why not Mars? Because it's terrible in every way for supporting life. Okay, so like that's one perspective, but still in so exploring, who knows what we might end up learning. So I'm big on it. I don't share the view of some on the left about it. - So I guess to add to your advice to young people, if a thing seems terrible, you still might wanna consider doing it? - I would say so, yeah. How many things have seen, I mean, listen, there are so many trips where the day before I say, why am I doing this? The jet lag, I've gotta do this and that. And now who, if my guest host falls through. I should just stay in work. And I go, hold on. You do this every time. Just go, you never regret it. You learn something, you try something. I never regret the trip. - This hopefully applies to the conversation we had today. David, I'm a big fan of yours. Thank you so much for talking today. Thank you for being patient with me. We tried to talk earlier. Please continue doing what you're doing. Please continue being objective and thoughtful and fearless. - Thank you. - On the internet. - Big fan of yours as well, I appreciate it. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with David Pakman.
