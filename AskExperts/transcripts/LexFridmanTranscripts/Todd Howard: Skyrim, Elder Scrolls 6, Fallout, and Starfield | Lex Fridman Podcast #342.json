I didn't look up the years before this this is depressing or or awesome um so all of these games brought hundreds probably for some of them thousands of hours of joy for me so Arena Daggerfall Morrowind Oblivion and Skyrim so I don't remember arena being that open world well it's all the provinces it follows kind of the same pattern it just doesn't have all the number of villages and places that Daggerfall has while Daggerfall focuses on the iliac Bay area arena does it all just changes the scale in terms of you know one block on the map equals this much space there is something that I mean I'm speaking anecdotal experience but I I just remember it feeling wide open Daggerfall it definitely was the way Arena didn't I don't remember maybe maybe because Arena it was so cool to have the just the role-playing game aspect you're focused on the items and the character development you Daggerfall has a lot more depth particularly in the character system that's what it introduces all of the skills and those kind of things Arena it's actually it's a game I love um and it's very very elegant if you look at the first one where it's just an XP based system do this get XP level up very classic role-playing game um Daggerfall digs deep into who's your character how you're going to develop it what are your skills there's advantages",
