        "text": "in AI had its own little sub specialization and sub in a little set of collection of skills people who would know how to engineer the features now solving subsume by deep learning we have this unification and so I expect a vision to become unified with natural languages well origins I expect I think it's I don't want to be too sure because I think on the commercial you know that is very computationally efficient RL is different RL does require slightly different techniques because you really do need to take action you really do need to do something about exploration your variance is much higher but I think there is a lot of unity even there and I would expect for example that at some point there will be some broader unification between RL and supervised learning where somehow they RL will be making decisions to make the supermost don't even go better and it'll be I imagine one big black box and you just throw every you know you shovel travel things into it and in just figures out what to do visit whatever you shovel in it I mean reinforcement learning has some aspects of language and vision combined almost there's elements of a long term memory that you should be utilizing and there's elements of a really rich sensory space so it seems like the it's like the union of the two or something like that but I'd say something slightly differently I'd say that reinforcement learning is neither but it naturally interfaces and integrates view the two of them do you think action is fundamentally different so yeah what is interesting about what is unique about policy of learning to act well so one example for instance is that when you learn to act you're fundamentally in a non-stationary world because as your actions change the things you see start changing you you experience the world in a different way",
