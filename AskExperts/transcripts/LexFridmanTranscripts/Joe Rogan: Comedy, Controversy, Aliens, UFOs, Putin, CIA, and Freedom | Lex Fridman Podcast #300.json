        "text": "- The following is a conversation with Joe Rogan, his second time on this podcast. He has inspired me for many years with his conversations to be a better and kinder person and has now been doing so as a friend. There's no one I would rather talk to on this 300th episode of this podcast on the 4th of July, both the anniversary of this country's Declaration of Independence and the anniversary of my immigrating here to the United States. A silly kid who couldn't speak English and could never imagine that he would be so damn lucky as to live the life I've lived. To feel the love I've felt from the amazing people along the way. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. I love you all. This is the, \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Joe Rogan. Charles Bukowski said something in a poem called, \"Style about Art.\" He defined art saying, \"Style is the answer to everything. A fresh way to approach adult or dangerous thing. To do a dull thing with style is preferable to doing a dangerous thing without it. To do a dangerous thing with style, is what I call art.\" What do you think you meant by that? Do you agree with this? - A dangerous thing with style is art. - He said, \"Bull fighting can be art, boxing can be art, loving can be art.\" Have you ever made love and it was art? No, I'm kidding, I'm not asking. (laughing) - Every time, bro. - Opening a can of sardines can be art. - I think there's something to that. Yeah, I think, I call the way people live life art. Like I wrote a forward to my friend Cameron Haynes's book and which is right now the number one selling audio book in the world. And I, one of the things that I said, was that he practices an art that very few people appreciate and it's the art of the maximized life and that the discipline that he displays in his life and through his practices and all the things that he does,",

        "text": "it's so difficult to live the way he lives. That for someone like me, who understands it and knows what he's doing and appreciates it and appreciates how insanely difficult it is to have a full-time job and run ultra-marathons, get up at four o'clock in the morning, run a full marathon before work. Like, that's the kind of shit that he does, when he is training for these 240 mile runs, all at the same time being like a father, a husband, having this full-time job, also being the best bow hunter on earth, lifting weights. It's like, how does a person do this? - So in a way, discipline is art too. - Yes, discipline is art. Yeah, I think it is 'cause it's beautiful for me to see, when I see someone who's really, truly disciplined, who, like a David Goggins, someone who just like truly maximizes the grind. I feel like there's an art to that and there's an art to kindness. Like, there's people that are really kind and really sweet. And when I'm around them, it's beautiful. It's like, there's a art to them. - [Lex] No matter what. - Yeah. - They still, they got, you know, the world can throw a bunch of shit at you, but through all of that. - They're like eh! Some people are just great at it. - [Lex] Yeah. - And it's a thing that you learn how to do and it's pleasing for other people to see. And that I think is where the art is. - Well, I think Bukowski also said and I'm just a Bukowski quote generator today. - [Joe] I love him. - I love him very much too. He's a dark and troubled and fascinating and a weird person like Hunter S. Thompson. - [Joe] Yeah. - He said, \"What matters most is how you walk through the fire.\" I think, so there's a bit of the Cam Hanes in that too, David Goggins in that too. What do you think he meant by that? - Well, how you walk through the fire? I mean, you can walk through the fire complaining along the way",

And there's beauty in that, there really is. And there's so much inspiration to be gathered from other people. If you're a charitable person, if you're charitable and compassionate and you can look at people, even people that I don't like, I try to look at the best aspects of how they live their life and recognize those aspects, admire them, give them credit for it. There's something that we can all get out of watching the way other people live their lives. So I got a chance to see you walk through the fire a little bit privately and publicly, this year in January? I gotta ask you about that. - [Joe] Oh, all that stuff? - So there's like generic conversations about sort of cancel culture and all those kinds of things. But as a human being, this to me is a fascinating sort of, there's the N word highlight video. There's the criticism of the different guests, whatever the side is on the COVID pandemic. And you, I mean, there's a mass amount of attack on you outside of being a public persona, outside of being a comedian, podcaster, you're also a human being. So how did you survive that? How did you sort of walk through that fire? Because you seem to do it with grace. - I used mushrooms. (laughing) That was one way I did it. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - Really. - What's your, as Andrew Huberman would say, what was your protocol? - I took, it was probably less than a gram, everyday. - [Lex] Everyday. - Yeah and uh, (laughing) I did a lot of like really hard working out, but also, I mean, there's a great benefit",

The great benefit is it gives you an opportunity to grow, gives you an opportunity to express yourself under pressure, to show your character, to show who you truly are. And it gives you an opportunity to see how you handle a very difficult situation. It also was fascinating as a person that's involved in media, right? Because what we're doing right now is media, even though, you know, it seems like podcasts seem like we're just having a conversation, right? - [Lex] Yeah. - And they are. And in that sense, it's kind of the purest form of media because what you're doing is, you're doing it without any fanfare. You're doing it without any, there's no executives looming over your head or network or big meetings about ratings or any of that stuff, but it is media. But what I got to see is the wiring under the machine of how the rest of media would try to take me out. And, you know, like when CNN would be just be playing things over and over and back and forth, it was wild to watch. What was also wild to watch, was people's responses because I gained 2 million subscribers during that time. Like, the podcast never got bigger. It just kept, kept growing, it had never been bigger than it had been at the end of all of it. It just made it bigger. And, you know, ultimately if you've fucked up in the past or made mistakes or done something wrong, that gives you an opportunity to discuss those things and to say, to apologize if you feel the need to apologize and also to just address it. And so people under that kind of pressure, it's an opportunity for them to understand how you think about things, honestly. How you actually, honestly think about things. And there's no more honesty that you get out of a person than when that person is under extreme duress, you know? So I think in that sense, I mean, it's horrible to say that it's a benefit, that it's a good thing that it happened, but it was a benefit. - Can you see how it can break a person? - [Joe] Yes.",

It's just my own psychology. - Well, it's also because you can't defend yourself because they're saying it and you're not there. And you don't have any opportunity for a rebuttal. And if you do have a rebuttal, you're doing it publicly and you're opening it up to the whole world to chime in. And there's a general tendency that people have towards negativity when they're interacting with strangers online, especially about controversial subjects. And even if it's only 10% of the people, it's one out of 10. That's a lot. That's a lot of negativity when you're dealing with thousands and thousands of tweets. - Yeah and I think maybe I'm just a very self-critical person, but I hear their words and probably somewhere deep inside, see the truth in the criticism, in some aspect of the criticism and that's why it hurts. - Well, but it's one aspect of you. - [Lex] Right. - You know, but when you're reading it, it's so, it's boiled down to this one thing as if that one thing defines you totally. Like if you've made a mistake, if you've said something that you shouldn't have said or if you said something and you know, maybe you should have considered it more carefully giving the gravity of the situation. You know, that that's just a part of being a person. And it's also part of being a person where you're communicating with things publicly in real time, thinking out loud, which is what we do. You know, it's complex and most people don't do it. And you're gonna have genuine hot takes where people just see what you said and go, why did he say that?",

'Cause I kind of worry about this and you're in many ways, but in this way, an inspiration that it didn't seem to have destroyed you, but is- - I kept doing shows, I kept doing standup. I ignored everything. I didn't read any of it. - [Lex] So it is possible to. - 100%, yes, yeah. I ignored it all. - [Lex] But you have like - - I knew it was there. - [Lex] Like your family didn't bring it up. - My family was very aware of it.

And then maybe you say to yourself, maybe I come across too rude or maybe I come across too insensitive or maybe I could do better in this way or that way. That's how we sort of shape our personalities and that's how we develop our social skills.

But the problem is the false narratives take hold. And then you have meetings, you have groups, you have bills on top of each other and there's this outrage and then it reaches you at some point. And it can just have these destructive effects. - It can, but it also sometimes doesn't. And in my case, it didn't work. (laughing) - What lessons did you draw from that? Mushrooms, excerise. - Mushrooms and exercise, exercise is critical. I don't think the mushrooms by themselves would've worked, but that's the thing that I use for everything, is the brutal exercise.

Like the amount of interactions that cells and molecules, the same exact interactions that have happened here on Earth have happened in the exact same order an infinite number of times in the cosmos. - Well, first of all, it's not certain that that's true. It's possible. - [Joe] It's possible. - Like Sean Carroll, you know, especially with quantum mechanics based on certain interpretation of quantum mechanics. That's very possible. But the question is, can you access those universes? - [Joe] Right and how far away are they? - The more sort of specific practical question is this local pocket of the universe, our galaxy or our neighboring galaxies, are there aliens there? What do they look like? - [Joe] Right. - Are they, so you can have this panspermia idea where a much larger, like daddy civilization,",

And those are the ones we might be interacting with. They're all kind of dumb as we are, relatively, you know, maybe a few million years apart. And then those are the ones we're interacting with and then we have a chance to actually connect with them and communicate with them. Or it could be like much more wide open. And you have these gigantic alien civilizations that are expanding very, very quickly. And the interesting thing is when you look up at the sky and you see the stars, that's light from those stars. We might not be seeing the alien civilizations until they're already here, meaning- - [Joe] Right. - Like you start expanding, once you get really good at expanding, you're going to be expanding very close to the speed of light. So right now we don't see much in the sky, but there could be one night, one day we wake up and it's just like everywhere and they're here. - [Joe] Right, but because the amount of time the light takes to reach us, yeah. And then, the thing that I've been really fascinated by is these alternative forms of transportation that they're discussing. Like the ability to harness wormhole and the ability to do things that a type three civilization is capable of. I had Michio Kaku on my podcast recently. Fantastic, love that guy. He's so good at taking extremely complex concepts and boiling them down for digestion and you know and saying them in a way that other people can appreciate. - And not being hesitant about saying wild, crazy shit that's out there. - [Joe] Yeah. - But grounded in what's actually possible. - Yeah, he's all in on this UFO phenomenon now. He's like, now the burden of proof is for people to come up with some sort of a conventional explanation for these things. He goes, because these things are defying all the concepts of physics that we currently know",

The problem is, like these military projects that are top secret, like how much money do they have? They have a lot of money. Like, but is it possible and maybe you could speak to this, is it possible that there could be some propulsion systems that have been developed and implemented that are far beyond just the simple burning of rocket fuel, pushing the fire out the back, which forces the rocket at extreme speeds forward. That's something that does harness gravity. Something that can distort space and time and can make travel from one point to another like preposterously fast. - Well, not only is it possible, I think it's likely that that kind of stuff would be kept a secret. - [Joe] Yeah. - It's just everything you see about the way, either if it's contractors like Lockheed Martin or if it's DOD, the actual Departments of Defense, they operate in complete secrecy. Just even looking at the history of the stealth fighter, just even stealth technology was kept a secret for a very, very long time. - [Joe] Yeah. - And not until you are ready to use it and need to use it, does it become public and not officially public. It just, is being detected out in the wild. So there's going to be a process where you're secretly testing it and that might creep up, which is maybe what we're seeing. And then it's waiting for the next big war, the next big reason to use the thing. - [Joe] Yeah. - And so yeah, there's, there's definitely technologies now, there might not be propulsion technologies, there could be AI surveillance technologies, there could be different kinds of stealth drones. There could be, it could be also in cyberspace, like cyber war weapons, all that kind of stuff that they're obviously going to be kept secret. - I'm very skeptical lately.

Power hungry idiots. - Yeah, I don't think everyone's an idiot, but I think there are enough idiots that it becomes a real problem if you're completely honest about everything you do and you know, you don't want to let everybody weigh in about things that are incredibly complex and that most people are ignorant of.",

So I started reading a lot about the KGB, Jack Barsky has a book on this, I talked to him and you start to realize, you probably looked into some of this, but you start to realize the scale of surveillance, of manipulation. Now a lot of them also talk about the incompetence of those organizations. The usual bureaucracy creeps in. But the point is, it seems like there's no line they're not willing to cross for the purpose of gathering intelligence, for the purpose of controlling people in order to gather intelligence. Now this is MI6, FSB, there's not much information about the FSB or the GRU, but the KGB. So we're always like 20 years behind or more on the actual information. And so I started to wonder, so I have not officially been contacted by any intelligence agency, but I started to wonder, well is there somebody I know that's doing that? Undercover CIA, undercover FSB, undercover anything? - You probably do. - Have you asked yourself this question? - Yeah, for sure. Yeah, people that have been on my podcast. Yeah, for sure. - Did you think there was actual, a guest that may have been? - 100%. - Oh man. - I would imagine. - [Lex] Would you know? - I have suspicions. - [Lex] Do you care?

There's clear narratives that they're trying to push forward to, whether it's to promote certain ideas or to diminish the power and reach of people who are mavericks or people who are, you know, who aren't connected to a system that you can't compromise.

And what's fascinating, is if you go and you try to watch it, if you try to watch Lenny Bruce today, it doesn't work because society has evolved. Like in many ways art is a window, especially like pop culture art or modern, you know, at the time culture art, art that discusses culture, is a window into that time period. It's a little bit of a time machine. So you have to put yourself like, what was it like to be in 1963? Like what was he saying in 1963? What was this like to hear him say this? And the civilization that existed in 1963, although it looked pretty similar, they're all driving cars and they're all wearing suits and they're all, it seems normal. It's a different world.

Lawrence has a book called, \"Lady Chatterley's Lover,\" and I know it sounds ridiculous, but it was one of the early books, I believe over a century ago that was very controversial for its sexual content.

Lenny Bruce was arrested many, many times and ultimately it wound up costing him his life. I mean, he died on the bathroom floor shooting heroin and trying to cope with all the lawsuits that he was going through. I mean this guy was constantly being arrested and constantly going through lawsuits. And then his comedy deteriorated horribly. There's some footage of him towards the end of his career where he essentially would go on stage with legal papers and read from the legal papers about his case. From then it's Richard Pryor, from him, then the next great is Richard Pryor and he had the most profound impact on me when I was a kid. When I was 15 years old, my parents took me to see, \"Live at the Sunset Strip,\" which is Richard Pryor's concert film.

(laughing) And they still, I don't know, it feels like even just empathetically, there's few things as difficult as that. - It's hard, I still remember those days. - [Lex] It's inspiring. - Many comics will say this and I think Dane Cook was the first person I heard say it publicly, that if he ever had to go back and do it again, like from scratch, he doesn't think he could do it. Doesn't think he could endure the struggle of open mic to you know, ultimately to success. And the numbers of people that try it and fail versus try and succeed are off the charts. I don't know if there's any other art form that has such a low rate of success. - Because it's psychologic, it's torture. - It is torture and it's also not something you can learn. Like here's the thing, like you play guitar, you can learn to play guitar. Someone can teach you the chords and if you do it and you could do, \"All Along the Watch Tower,\" you could play it. You can't teach someone how to do comedy. - You think it's you're funny or not? Or can you still figure it out? Like can you still learn? - [Joe] Yeah, you can figure it out, yeah. - Can you start being unfunny - [Joe] Yes. - And become funny? - Yes, it's possible. It's not easy though. - You're gonna have to eat a lot of shit. - You're gonna have to eat a lot of shit and you're gonna have to examine why you're not funny. And you're gonna have to spend a lot of time with uncomfortable thoughts and try to figure out what it is, like, what's missing? Like, you know, could you edit your stuff",

You know, I could do impressions of people and I could talk about sex. - [Lex] Yeah. - Those are the things that I was interested in back then. I mean, if I was talking philosophically, I didn't have a philosophy, I didn't have a unique perspective on life, I hadn't experienced much. - So every time you bombed, it forces you to introspect, to ask questions to yourself and then that's how you actually develop a philosophy. - [Joe] Yeah. - Of what you actually believe. - You learn through doing. And I think you could say that about podcasting too. You know, I'm certainly way better at having conversations than I ever was when I first started doing comedy, or excuse me, when I first started doing podcasts. - You just stick with a kid because one day you'll be able to interview Donald Trump. You'd be man enough to handle that conversation. How hard is it to do? 'Cause I've been really curious. It's been on my bucket list because I'm terrified. I wanna do everything I'm terrified of. - You'll do standup? - No, but I do want to do like one five minute open mic. - Why don't you do, \"Kill Tony?\" - How hard is it to do, five minutes, would you say? - It's hard. Well, it depends on, you know, how long you've been thinking about doing comedy. It depends on how you look at things and also depends on your style of comedy.

It's the most important show in comedy because first of all, it establishes standup in a sense that like, for the open mic'ers, for the people that are starting it out, it establishes that the most important thing is to be funny.

But because it's in your unconscious, you use it to project onto others, you see it as flaws in others.

There's a thing about (imitates heavy breathing) you kind of almost like a mantra gets formed and you get into it. - No, it's great here in the Austin heat, 100 degree weather. - [Joe] Yeah. - That tests you. - You know what I love to do outside? - [Lex] What's that? Pull sleds, that's my thing. I love to pull sleds outside. - In the heat? - Yeah, I did today. - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - Yeah I love it. - So you're also, your wife is incredible. You're in a relationship, you're married, you have a great family. What advice would you give to me and to others like me, who are dumb fucks and have not found a relationship. - Well you're a great guy, so this definitely doesn't necessarily apply to you, but be someone who someone would want to be in a relationship with. There's a lot of people out there that want a great partner. They want someone in a relationship. But why would someone want to be in a relationship with you? You know, maybe you bicker a lot, maybe you're jealous, maybe you lie. Maybe you, you know, maybe you're cruel, maybe you don't have a sense of humor. Maybe you're, you know, you're not kind. Like what is? What is it about you",

Fix that, fix that. - Well this applies to me as well, Like you said something with Cam Hanes, one of the things you admire is the, the discipline takes to sort of juggle so many things and do it successfully. I'm not sure I'm very good at that. - So juggling all this hard work and then also a relationship. - Also a relationship, also family, all these kinds of priorities. I mean that requires having your shit together. - It does, it's a different thing. But it's also, you gotta find the right person. There's a lot of people who they settle for sexy, they settle for hot. - [Lex] Oh for looks. - They settle for the wrong person. Like you can get hot and nice, they're out there. - [Lex] Yeah. - But don't get hot and mean, hot and mean's not fun. Then you get Amber Heard. - Yeah and then you end up at trial. - Yeah, yeah, you can be deceived by perfect symmetry. - So you don't think it's a good idea to record your partner? - I think you should record all conversations. The CIA's doing it no matter what. I assume that every conversation I have is recorded 'cause I'm pretty sure it is. - Even when we had dinner with Alex Jones, he was recording. - [Joe] Yes. - I still remember that. (laughing) - Oh, I didn't even know that was recording. - You know what'd be funny? If he is the CIA. - [Joe] He could be, could be. - That'd be the ultimate joke. - But that's my advice about relationships, is be somebody and then also like find someone who you can grow with, right? You don't want to be with someone who doesn't share your values. You don't wanna be with someone who makes excuses, you don't wanna be with someone who's lazy or who's spiteful. You wanna be with someone who's like, genuinely kind. And that's one of the things",

That's the kind of people that you could have in your life as friends and as coworkers and as lovers and wives and husbands, you can find those people, they're real. And when you find those people, your life is better. Like to have a good tribe is very important, to have a good tribe of people, you know?

It's so valuable to have quality people around you because it makes you want to do better because you admire the hard work that these put people put in, like Cam Hanes or Goggins or many of my friends and people that are generous and people that are curious and people that are honest, they inspire you to do the same and it's extremely valuable. It's one of the most valuable things, is to surround yourself with positive, healthy, friendly, generous people. - That's why I cut out Tim Dillon from my life. - [Joe] Ah! - I broke up with him. - [Joe] I thought you guys were getting married? - No, it's over.

No, no, I love him. - If he worked out, he would be a house. - He's got such a large frame - [Lex] Brick house. - You know? - So if I interview Putin, what should I ask him? - How's the cancer? How's it doing, buddy? That's question number one in Russian. Do you think he has cancer? - I don't think so. - The narrative is terrifying, right? Dictator of the largest nuclear arsenal in the world who also has cancer and he just invaded a sovereign country. That's a terrifying narrative because that's what we're all afraid of, someone who has nothing to lose, who just decides to let loose a nuke. - Well I do think, maybe it's projecting, but if I had cancer or if you think about leaders that have cancer, you are facing your own mortality. I would think he'll be more focused on his legacy and dropping nuclear bombs is not good for legacy. I do believe he wants to be remembered as a great leader, as a lot of leaders do, as a lot of even dictators do. And I think he wants to figure out a way to pull out a win so he can say that whatever this thing was, whatever this invasion was, was good for Russia, was good for the nation. He ultimately made it a greater nation than it was before. And perhaps you could justify an escalation of war to be that. But I don't and it's just the cancer thing concerns me so much because it's been so often part of this propaganda that's been told about Putin that he's sick. - [Joe] Right. - I don't know why, people kind of wonder that a lot about, especially dictators. But you had that even like with Hillary Clinton and obviously with Biden, that narrative is stickier. So for some people. - Well that narrative is transparent. - [Lex] Yeah. - [Joe] And obvious. - But the degree of it, is a question with Biden as it is with everyone. Like, how healthy is this leader? That's a question people often ask. - Right, sure always.",

His body doesn't look much bigger, but his face looks like puffy and swollen. I had a friend who had sarcoidosis and they prescribed prednisone, which is a type of a steroid. And one of the things that would happen when he was on it is his face would get really big. It was like he would blow up, like swell up and maintain a lot of water and inflammation. And that's what it looks like when I'm looking at Putin. - So actually like if you're sitting with him, questions about health that's, has Biden been asked that kind of question? No, like without mockery, without. - He'd have to go on Fox News. Like, the mainstream media treats him with kid gloves in a way that I've never seen. I mean it's so obvious, there's something horribly wrong with his cognitive function. - Well, to push back, I don't know if it's horribly wrong. - [Joe] You don't think it's horribly wrong? - I think it's, no, I think there's uncertainty to which degree is wrong. I would love there to be a serious like conversation about it with him. - [Joe] Yeah. - In fact, I actually have to now look 'cause of course Fox News will mock his like declining mental health and then I would love like sort of an objective discussion. Are you aware of this? Are you like, what are you putting in place? Are you yourself? Because if I was a person with a declining mental abilities, like you have to start thinking about that kind of stuff. Like who is around you? Who are the advisors? What if you stop being able to see the world clearly? - [Joe] Yeah. - I would be transparent about that kind of stuff. - Well you would be, but you also would never be a politician. - [Lex] Yeah. - 'Cause you're too fuckin' honest. - Well, yeah, but actually from a conversation perspective, it would be nice if that kind of discussion was had. - It would be.

I mean the way he has it set up, the elections are a joke. - So he would push back, that's not clearly not a democracy. He is still very popular, so majority of people are huge supporters of Putin inside Russia, the people that push back against that would say that that's because any serious opposition is pushed out of the country. - [Joe] Yeah. - So like his competition. - Arrested, murdered. - Yeah so, but yes, that's a really, really good question. - The value of dictatorships. One of the things about the United States that's fascinating to me is that every four years, unless it's four to eight years, right? Someone does two terms. But every four years there's an opportunity for someone to be new and completely inexperienced at the most difficult job in the world, which is ridiculous. - So the the interesting thing is it actually makes sense after eight years, you've gained the wisdom. - [Joe] Yeah. - You would actually be a pretty good leader to keep going. - [Joe] Yeah. - But there is some problem where the power gets started getting to your head. - [Joe] Yeah. - And so like from Putin's perspective, I think he genuinely wants the best for Russia. I don't think he's lost his mind in terms of like, it's all about greed and so on. Same as Stalin. I think Stalin until the end of his days wanted the best for the Soviet Union. So it's not like you become, Hitler I think lost his mind during the war. Like where it was like he wasn't seen clearly at all. What Putin believes is that he is actually the best person to bring out the best for his country. Now the problem is, maybe refreshing the leader is in fact in the long term, the best thing. Versus every leader believes they know what's best for the country. Our point is to keep refreshing it. - [Joe] Well.",

And that if you had the perfect person in, having them for 12, 20 years would be amazing. If you had a perfect benevolent leader who clearly only cared about the people and was doing their best and striving hard and got great satisfaction knowing that he is a dedicated civil servant that only wants to lead the country in a way that's gonna benefit the most people in the most profound way. But we have a dirty political system. It's completely corrupted by money, completely corrupted by influence. The fact that, you know, the lobbyists, I mean there's an area outside of Washington, DC, it's one of the richest areas in the country and it's where the lobbyists live. There's so much money involved in being a lobbyist. There's so much money involved in special interest groups and how much of an impact they have on who gets elected and what decisions get made once that person gets elected. We know this, right? We know it's not for the people, by the people. It's just not what it is. I mean, this country is an experiment in self-government. And if we could do it all over again, I would say the most important thing is to have laws in place to keep money out of politics and to make it a heinous crime for someone to influence laws and policy based entirely on the amount of profit it could generate for a party or for a company that is investing in a candidate. That's fuckin' incredibly dangerous and it's corrupt and that corruption has been accepted. We've just accepted, that this corruption exists, you know? - Last question. If Putin asks to see this watch, what do I tell him? Well, would you give it? Should I let him see it? 'Cause we know what happens with a Super Bowl ring. - I think a Super Bowl ring is unique.

It's just something about me says I need to go there. But to put in loose words is, to try to understand what that world is now. So I remember what it was years ago when I was there. I know my family, I know the generations of family that was there on that land in Ukraine and in Russia and the soul of the people, the love that's there, the beauty of the culture. And I wanna see what it is today and what this war has created. Both the anger and the love and the people and just hear them out and just talk to them. No recordings, none of that.

You sometimes you have to go to a place to really understand it, you can't just read about it, you can't just talk to the people that are living there, you have to be there.

So you don't like, so why go swim out? Why go surfing? Why go swim out in the ocean? - [Joe] Yeah. - So I'm somebody that's the same probably with sharks too.
