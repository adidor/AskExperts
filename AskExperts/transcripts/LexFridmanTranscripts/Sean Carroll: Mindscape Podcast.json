        "text": "you venturing into questions of religion well I'm totally comfortable doing it you know I did talk with Alan Lightman who is also an atheist but he he is trying to rescue the sort of spiritual side of things for atheism and I did talk to very vocal atheists like Alex Rosenberg so I need to talk to some I talked to some religious believers and he talked more how have you changed through having all these conversations you know part of the motivation was I had a long stack of books that I hadn't read and I couldn't find time to read them and I figured if I interviewed their authors before me to read them right and that's that is totally worked by the way now I'm annoyed that people write such long books I think I'm still very much learning how to be a good interviewer I think that's a skill that uh you know I I think I have good questions but you know there's the give-and-take that is still I think I could be better at like I want to offer something to the conversation but not too much right I've had conversations where I barely talked at all and I have conversations where I talked half the time I think there's a happy medium in between there so I think I remember listening to without mentioning names some of your conversations where I wish you would have disagreed more yeah as a listener it's more fun sometimes it well this is that's a very good question because you know my everyone has an attitude toward that like some people are really there to basically give their point of view and the they're their guest is supposed to you know respond accordingly I want to sort of get my view on the record but I don't want to dwell on it when I'm talking to someone like David Chalmers who I disagree with a lot you know I want to say like here's why I disagree with you but you know I want we're here to listen to you like I have an episode every week and you're only on once a",
