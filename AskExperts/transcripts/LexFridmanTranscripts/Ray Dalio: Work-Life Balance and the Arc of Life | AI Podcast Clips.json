        "text": "much of your passions and life has been through something you might be able to call work Alan Watts has this quote he said that the real key to life secret of life is to be completely engaged with what you're doing in the here and now and instead of calling it work realize that it's play so I'd like to ask what is the role of work in your life's journey or in a life's journey and what do you think about this modern idea of kind of separating work and let work-life balance I have a principle that I believe in is make your work in your passion the same thing okay okay so that's similar face uh-uh-uh-uh-uh in other words if you can make your work in your passion it's just gonna work out great and then of course people have different purposes of work and I don't want to be theoretical about that people have to take care of their family so money at a certain point is the base is an important component of that work so you look beyond that what is money gonna get you and what are you're trying to achieve but the most important thing I agree is meaningful work and meaningful relationships like if you can get into the thing that your your mission that you're on and you are excited about that mission that you're on and then you can do that with people who you have the meaningful relationships with you have meaningful work and meaningful relationships I mean that is fabulous for most people and it seems that many people struggle to get there not out of not necessarily because they're constrained by the fact that they have the financial constraints of having to provide for their family and so on but it's I mean moat you know this idea is out there that there needs to be a work-life balance which means that most people on this thing we're gonna return to the same things most doesn't mean optimal but most people seem to not be doing their life's passion not be not unifying work and passion why do you",
