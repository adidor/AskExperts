        "text": "- So one interesting philosophical point in quantum mechanics bring up is the, that you talk about the distinction between the world as it is and the world as we observe it. So, staying at the human level for a second. How big is the gap between what our perception system allows us to see and the world as is is outside our mind's eye, sort of, not at the quantum mechanical level but as just our, these particular tools we have which is a few senses and our cognitive abilities to process those senses? - Well, that last phrase, \"Having the cognitive abilities to process them.\" carries a lot, right? I mean there is our sort of intuitive understanding of the world. You don't need to teach people about gravity for them to know that apples fall from trees, right? That's something that we figure out pretty quickly. Object permanence, things like that. The three-dimensionality of space, even if we don't have the mathematical language to say that, we kind of know that it's true. On the other hand, no one opens their eyes and sees atoms. Or molecules, or cells for that matter, forget about quantum mechanics. So, but we got there, we got to understanding that there are atoms and cells, using the combination of our senses and our cognitive capacities. So adding the ability of our cognitive capacities to our senses is adding an enormous amount and I don't think that it is a hard and fast boundary. You know if you believe in cells, if you believe that we can understand those, then there's no reason you believe we can't, believe in quantum mechanics just as well.",
