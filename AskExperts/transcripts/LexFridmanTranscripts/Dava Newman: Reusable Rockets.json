        "text": "- Is there something else that you've been excited about, like reusable rockets perhaps, that you've seen in the last few years? - Yep, well the re-usability you had, the re-usability is awesome! (laughter) I mean it's just the best. Now, we have to remember the shuttle was a reusable vehicle. Which, the shuttle is an amazing, as an aerospace engineer, I mean the shuttle is sill just the most gorgeous, elegant, extraordinary design of a space vehicle. It was reusable, it just wasn't affordable. But the re-usability of it was really critical because we flew it up, it did come back so the notion of re-usability, I think, absolutely. Now what we're doing with we and all, the global we, but with SpaceX and Virgin, sending the rockets up, recovering the first stages, where if they can regain 70% cost savings, that's huge. And just seeing the control, y'know, there couldn't be a control on dynamics, just seeing that rocket come back and land, - Oh yeah, that's-- - It never gets old, it's exciting every single time you look at it and say \"That's magic\". So, it's so cool. - To me, the landing is when I stand up and start clapping. Just, just the control. - Yeah, just the, the algorithms, just the control, and hitting that landing, it's, y'know, it's gymnastics for rocket ships, but to see these guys stick a landing. - Pretty well put. - Is just wonderful. Like I said, every time I see, y'know, the re-usability and the rockets coming back and landing so precisely, it's really exciting. So it is, actually, that's a game-changer. We are in a new era of lower cost and a lot higher frequency. And it's the world, not just NASA, many nations are really upping their frequency of launches.",
