Lex I'm a high school student in Libya I am very interested in new technology and artificial intelligence and have taken the online course cs50x from Harvard what do you advise people like me to learn I'm at a disadvantage because of my country's educational system I one day want to become a great engineer like you Elon Musk and many more that may not be as famous I'm very grateful for the mere chance if you're applying to this when a world were in that a kid from nowhere can be asking questions of an MIT researcher Zecharia thank you very much for the question you're too kind I probably have a lot to say about this topic but let me try to be brief into the point I think it's wonderful that you reached out and there you have a clarity to your passion don't lose track of that in your college years in the years to come don't forget that you have an interest in artificial intelligence don't forget that that fire was there when you were in high school and keep that fire burning I think the the question you've asked is about the disadvantage I think we live in a world where there's a lot of injustice where we don't all start from the same place and that disadvantage doesn't always look the same for everyone and how to make a more just world is in many ways we're struggling as a society to understand no but that's a much bigger topic than either you or I I think what you should be focused on is what you can do for your life your circumstances your circumstance I've always believed that my disadvantages are my superpowers and I think your disadvantage is your superpower use it as fuel if you look at stories of great men of great women in history that story always has a lot of disadvantages that were overcome there is something in the process of overcoming hardship that creates greatness most people quit through that process if you can survive it then your",
