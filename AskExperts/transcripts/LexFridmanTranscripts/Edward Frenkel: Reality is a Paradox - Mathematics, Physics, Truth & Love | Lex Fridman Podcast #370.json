So I remember the first time I heard this story, I thought, hmm, how interesting. What coincidence that he, this came to him when he was whistling. But in fact it's not. This is how it works in some sense, that you have to prepare for it, but then it happens when you stop thinking actually. So the moment of discovery is the moment when thinking stops. And you kind of, you kind of almost become that truth that you're seeking. - The following is a conversation with Edward Frenkel, one of the greatest living mathematicians doing research on the interface of mathematics and quantum physics with an emphasis on the Langlands program, which he describes as a grand unified theory of mathematics. He also is the author of \"Love and Math, the Heart of Hidden Reality.\" This is a \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" To support it please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Edward Frenkel. You open your book \"Love and Math\" with a question. \"How does one become a mathematician? There are many ways that this can happen. Let me tell you how it happened to me.\" So how did it happen to you? - So, first of all, I grew up in the Soviet Union in a small town near Moscow called Kolomna. And I was a smart kid, you know, in school. But mathematics was probably my least favorite subject. Not because I couldn't do it, I was, you know, a straight A student and I could do all the problems easily. But I thought it was incredibly boring. And since the only math I knew was what was presented at school, I thought that was it. And I was like, \"What kind of boring subject is this?\" So what I really liked was physics, and especially quantum physics. So I was buying, I was, I would go to a bookstore and buy popular books about elementary particles and atoms and things like that. And read them, you know, devour them. And so I thought, my dream was to become",

        "text": "a theoretical physicist, and to delve into this finer structure of the universe. You know? So then something happened when I was 15-years-old. It turns out that a friend of my parents was a mathematician who was a professor at the local college, it was a small college preparing educators, teachers. It's a provincial town. Imagine it's like 117 kilometers from Moscow, which would be something like 70 miles, I guess. You do the math. - I like how you remember the number exactly. - Yeah. Isn't it funny how we remember numbers? So his name was Evgeny Evgenievich Petrov. And if this doesn't remind you of the great works of Russian literature, then you haven't read them, like \"War and Peace\", you know, like with the patronymic names. But this was all real, this was all happening. So my mum, one day, by chance, met Evgeny Evgenievich and told him about me, that I was the bright kid and interested in physics. And he said, \"Oh, I wanna meet him. I'm going to convert him into math.\" And my mum is like, \"Nah, math, he doesn't like mathematics.\" So he said, \"Okay, let's see what I can do.\" So I went to see him, so I'm about 15. And a bit arrogant, I would say, you know, like average teenager. So he says to me, \"So I hear that you are interested in physics, elementary particles.\" It's like, \"Yeah, sure.\" He said, \"For example, do you know about quarks?\" And I said, \"Yes, of course I know about quarks.\" Quarks are the, you know, constituents of particles like protons and neutrons. And it was one of the greatest discoveries in theoretical physics in the '60s, that those particles were not elementary, but in fact had the smaller parts. And he said, \"Oh, so then you probably know representation theory of the group SU3?\" Like SU what? So, in fact, I wanted to know what was, what were the underpinnings of those theories? I knew the story, I knew the narrative. I knew kind of this basic story of what these particles look like,",

        "text": "but how did physicists come up with these ideas? How were they able to theorize them? And so I remembered, you know, like it was yesterday. So he pulls out a book and it's kind of like, it's like a bible, you know, like a substantial book. And he opens it somewhere in the middle. And there I see the diagrams that I saw in popular books, but in popular books there was no explanation. And now I see all these weird symbols and equations. It's clear that it is explained in there. Oh my God! He said, \"You think what they teach you at school is mathematics?\" It's like, \"No, this is real mathematics.\" So I was instantly converted. - That to understand the underpinnings of physical reality, you have to understand what SU3 is. - You have to learn what are groups, what is group SU3? What are representations of SU3? There was a coherent and beautiful, I could appreciate the beauty, even though I could not understand heads and tails of it. - But you were drawn to the methodology, the machinery of how such understanding could be attained. - Well, in retrospect, I think what I was really craving was a deeper understanding. And up to that point, the deepest that I could see were those diagrams, but for that story that, you know, a proton consists of three quarks and a neutron consists of three quarks and they're called up and down and so on. But I didn't know that there was actually underneath, beneath the surface, there was this mathematical theory. - If you can just linger on it, what drew you to quantum mechanics? Is there some romantic notion of understanding the universe? What is interesting to you? Is it the puzzle of it, or is it like the philosophical thing? - Now I am looking back, so whatever I say about Edward at 15 is colored by my, you know, all my experiences that happen in the meantime. - I should say for- - My current views and so on. - For the people who may not know you, I think your book and your presentations kind of revealed that that 15-year-old is still in there somewhere. - [Edward] Well I take it as a compliment. - Some of the joy. - He's probably still here now.",

The secrets. And we may not discover all of them, we may not be able to understand, but we're going to try. And go as far and as deep as we can. I think that's what was the motivating factor in this. - Yeah, there's this mystery, there's this dark room and there's a few of these mathematical physicists that are able to shine a flashlight briefly into there. We'll talk about it, but it also kind of makes me sad that there's so few of your kind that have the flashlight to look into the room. It's interesting. - I don't think there are so few, to be honest, because I think I find a lot of people are actually interested. If you talk to people, you know, like some people you wouldn't expect to be interested in this, from all walks of life, from people of all kinds of professions. I tell them I'm a mathematician, and they, a mathematician, okay, so that's a separate story. A lot of people, I think, have been traumatized by their experience in their math classes. We can talk about it later. But then they ask me what kind of research I do, and I mention that I work on the interface of math and quantum physics. And their eyes light up and say, \"Oh, quantum physics!\" Or like Einstein's relativity. \"Oh, I am really curious about it.\" I watched this podcast, or I watched that podcast, you know, and I've learned this. It's like, \"What do you think about that?\" So I actually find that actually physicists are doing a great job educating the public, so to speak. And in terms of popular books and videos and so on. Mathematicians are behind, we're starting to catch up a little bit, have been starting last 10 years, but we are still behind. But I think people are curious. Science is still very much, you know, something that people want to learn because that's our, kind of the best way we know to establish",

Like even though for me at this point, I always, you know, make an argument that our physical theories always change. They get updated. So you had Newton's theory of gravity. Then Einstein's theory, you know, superseded it. But in mathematics it seems that theories don't change. Pythagoras' theorem has been the same for the last 2,500 years. X squared plus Y squared equals Z squared. We don't expect that next year suddenly it will be Z cubed, you know. So, and so that to me is actually even more, hints even more at how much we are connected to each other. Because Pythagoras' theory, if you think about it, or any other mathematical theorem, means the same thing to anyone in the world today, regardless of their cultural, you know, upbringing, religion, you know, ideas, ideology, gender, whatever, nationality, race, whatever, right? And it has meant the same to everyone everywhere, and most likely will mean the same. So that's, to me, kind of an antidote to the kind of divisiveness that we sometimes observe these days, where it seems that we can't agree on anything. - To the political complexity of two plus two equals five in George Orwell's \"1984.\" - I was in the Soviet Union in 1984, and so in many ways I see that it was prescient, the novel was prescient. But we still have not found a dictator who would actually say two plus two equals five and would demand their citizens to repeat that. - The night is still young. - Has not happened yet, okay! - Not yet. But it does feel like math and physics are both sneaking up to a deep truth from slightly different angles. And you stand at the crossroads, or at the intersection of the two. It's interesting to ask, what do you think is the difference between physics and mathematics, in the way physics and mathematics look at the world. - There is actually an essential difference, which is that physicists are interested in describing this universe.

        "text": "Mathematicians are interested in describing all possible mathematical universes, of which, you know, and some of our work, I still consider myself more of a mathematician than a physicist. My first love for physics, not withstanding. Mathematicians are, in a way we have more diversity, you might say. So we are accepting, for instance, our universe has three spatial dimensions and one time dimension, right? So what I mean is that- - Allegedly. - Allegedly. Observed, but that we can observe today, right? So of course there are theories where there are some hidden dimensions as well. Let's just say observed, observed dimensions. So this tabletop has two dimensions, because you can have two coordinate axis, X and Y, but then there is also a third one to describe the space of this room. And then there is a time dimension. So realistic theories of physics have to be about spaces of three dimensions, or space time. So four dimensions. But mathematically we are just as interested in theories in 10 space time dimensions, or 11, or 25, or whatever. Or infinite dimensional spaces, you know. So that's the difference. On the other hand, I have to give it to the physicists. We don't have the same satisfaction that they have of having their theories confirmed by an experiment. We don't get to play with big machines like LHC in Geneva, Large Hadron Collider that recently discovered, you know, the Higgs boson and some other things. For us, it's all like a mental exercise in some sense. We do, we prove things by using rules of logic, and that's our way of confirming, experimental confirmation if you will. But I think we kind of, I kind of envy a little bit my friends physicists that they get to, they get to experience this sort of, these big toys, you know, and play with them. - But it does seem that sometimes, as you've spoken about, abstract mathematical concepts map to reality, and it seems to happen quite a bit. - That's right, so the mathematics is, underpins physics, obviously, it's a language.

And those who don't know the language, I'm paraphrasing, \"Are left to wander in a dark labyrinth.\" That's a famous quote from Galileo. Which is very true and has become even more true more recently in theoretical physics in the most sort of far out parts of the theoretical physics that have to do with elementary particles, as well as the structure of the cosmos at the large scale. - What do you think of Max Tegmark who wrote the book \"Mathematical Universe\"? So do you think, just lingering on that point, you think at the end of the day, the future generations will all be mathematicians. Meaning the ones that deeply understand the way the universe works, at the core is it just mathematics? - At the core of, you know. I would say mathematics is one half of the core. So the book is called \"Love and Math.\" Okay? So these are the two pillars. - [Lex] Yeah. - In my view. In other words, you can't cover everything by math. So mathematics gives you tools. It gives you a way, kind of a clear vision. But mathematics by itself is not enough for one to have a harmonious and balanced life, you know? So I am suspicious of any theory that declares that everything is mathematics. - So math can generate things that are beautiful, but it can't explain why it's beautiful. - Math, you could say, is a way to discern patterns, to find regularities in the universe. And both physical and mental universe. Mathematics explores the mind as much as it explores the physical world around us. And it helps us to find those patterns, which kind of, which makes our perception more sophisticated, our ability to perceive things such as beauty, you know? And it sharpens our ability to see beauty, to understand beauty. So our world becomes more complex from thinking that our, that Earth is flat, we go to realizing that it is round, that it's shaped as a sphere, so that we can actually travel around the Earth, you know? So there isn't a place where we hit the end, so to speak. And then proceeding in the same vein,",

This is much harder to imagine, a bent three-dimensional or four-dimensional, three-dimensional space or four-dimensional space time, because this idea that the space around us is flat, is so deeply entrenched. And yet we know from this theory, and from the experiments that have confirmed it, that a ray of light bends around a star as if being attracted by the force of gravity. But in fact the force of gravity is the bending. It's just that it's not only the bending on the space, it's also the bending of space time. There is a curvature not only between spatial dimensions. The way parallels and meridians come together in a small scale, they look like perpendicular lines. But if you zoom out, you see that the space are, they're curving the space. They are sort of the tracks along which the space gets curved. That would be the curvature of spatial dimensions. But in fact now through in time, and one time, imagine a sphere which lives, which has one of, the meridians can respond to time and the parallels can respond to space. I can't imagine it, but I can write a mathematical formula expressing that curvature. And that's, in fact that curvature is responsible for the force of gravity attraction between the sort of simplest instantiation of it, attraction between two planets, or between two human beings for that matter. - Yeah, the time, bending time, it's not very nice that what that theory did to time, because it feels like the marching of time forward is fundamental to our human experience. The arrow of time marching forward nicely seems to be the only way we can understand the universe. And the fact that you can start- - Up to now, up to now. There are people who claim that they can, that they have, they possess other ways of experiencing it. - So truly can visualize messing with time. - Well, messing with time, but not necessarily messing with time because one point of view is that, you know.

And then you look at the clock and it's like, \"Oh my God, two hours have passed and it felt like a couple of seconds.\" When you are absorbed, when you are in love, when you are passionate about something, when you're creating something, you are, we lose ourselves and we lose the sense of time and space for that matter. You see? So there is only that which is happening, that creative process. So I think that this is familiar to all of us. - And we may be actually the closest to the truth at that moment. - Yes. - To the true- - So yes, so there is a point of view that this is where we are, we are who we are, at our sort of fundamental, at our fundamental level. And after that, the mind comes in and tries to conceptualize it. It's like, oh, because I was writing something, I was writing a book, I was painting this painting. Or maybe I was watching this painting and got totally absorbed in it. Or I fell in love with this person. That's what happened. But in the moment when it's happening, you're not thinking about it. You're just there. - Yeah, we construct narratives around the set of memories that seem to have happened in sequence, or at least that's the way we tell ourselves that. And we also have a bunch of weird human things like consciousness and the experience of freewill, that we chose a set of actions as the time unrolled forward. - [Edward] Right. - And we are intelligent, conscious agents taking those actions.

So Isaac Newton said, \"To myself, I only appeared as a child playing on the seashore.\" And every once in a while finding a prettier pebble or a prettier shell. Whilst I think some, he said something like, the infinite ocean of knowledge lay, was lying before me. Alexander Grothendieck, who probably was the greatest mathematician of the second half of the 20th century, the French mathematician Alexander Grothendieck, wrote that \"Discovery is a privilege of a child.\" The child who is not afraid to be wrong once again, to look like an idiot, you know, to try this and that, I'm paraphrasing, and go through trial and error.

But much more than that, they're also capable of that, you know, wide-eyed in a sort of perspective. So does it, can it really be captured, that perspective, that sense of awe? Can it really be captured by computation alone? I actually, I don't know the answer, so I'm not sort of trying to, to present a particular point of view.

So like that young child is not a blank slate. They're coming, they actually hold within them the knowledge of several billions of years. - Right.

When you would tend to explain things in theological religious terms. Today science has progressed. There are fewer people who kind of buy into religion, official religion, you know.

It's mimicking, it's trying to compress all the weirdness of humans, of all the debates and discussions, the perspectives, all the different ways that people approach solving different problems, all of that compressed. So we live, we're each individual ants. We only have, like, we have a family, we interact with a few little ants. And here comes AI that's able to summarize like a TL;DR report of humanity. - [Edward] And that's the beauty of it. So I embrace it.",

We can be truly in love. We can be truly inspired when it is not fake. I do believe, call me romantic, okay, but I do believe, and this is a very good, I'm glad you're putting it in those terms because I've had conversations like that, that, yeah, fake it till you make it, but that's like, that's what humans do. Yes, we do that, but not all the time. So, and that is debatable because also I speak from my own experience, and that's where the first person perspective comes in, the subjective view. I cannot prove to you, for instance, or anyone else, that there are certain moments in my life where I am genuine, I am pure, so to speak. When it's not faking it. But I do have a tremendous certainty of it. And that's a subjective certainty. Now I am, as a scientist, I'm also trained to give more credibility to objective arguments that, and there are things that can be reproduced, things that I can demonstrate, that I can show. But as I get older. - There we go. - As I get more mature, surely, hopefully, you know, I'm starting to question, why I am not giving as much credibility to my subjective understanding of the world, the kind of the first person perspective, when actually modern science has already sold on that. You know, quantum mechanics has shown unambiguously that the observer is always involved in the observation. Likewise, Godel's incompleteness theorems, to me, show how essential is the observer of a mathematical theory. For one thing, that's the one who chooses the axioms.",

You're just describing in all of these different scales the observer, what the observer means. - That's right, so we, science of 19th century had the, from modern perspective, and I don't want to offend anybody, had the delusion that somehow you could analyze the world being completely detached from it. We now know, after the landmark achievements of the first half of the 20th century, that this is nonsense. That is simply not true. And this has been experimentally proved time and time again. So to me, I'm thinking maybe it's a hint that I should take my first person perspective seriously as well, and not just rely on kind of objective phenomena. Things that can be proved in a traditional sort of objective way, by setting up an experiment that can be repeated many times. Maybe I fall in love, the deepest love of my life, perhaps, perhaps hasn't happened yet. Perhaps I will fall in love and this, but it's unique. It's a unique event. You can't reproduce it necessarily, you see. So in that sense, you see how these things are closely connected. I think that if you, if we are declaring from the outset that all there is to life is, you know, computation in the form of neural networks or something like this, however sophisticated they might be, I think we are from the outset denying to ourselves the possibility that yes, there is a side of me which is not faking it. Yes, there is a side of me which cannot be captured. Biological and reason. And you know what another great scientist said, Blaise Pascal? He said, \"The heart has its reasons of which the reason knows nothing.\" And then he also said, \"The last step of reason is to grasp that there are infinitely many things beyond reason.\" How interesting.

Now you can always say that's not the case, but why should we, from the outset, exclude this possibility that there is something to what he was saying? That is my question. I'm not taking sides. What I'm trying to do is to shake a little bit the debate, because most mathematicians that I know, and computer scientists even more so, they're kind of already sold on this. We are just, you know, it reminds me of this famous Lord Kelvin's quote from the end of 19th century. There's some debate whether he actually said that, but never let a good story, you know, stand in the way of truth. He said physics is basically finished. All that remains is more precise measurement. So I find a lot of my colleagues are happy to say, everything's finished, we already got, we got it, we got it. Maybe little tweaks in our large language models, you know. So now here's my question. I'm kind of playing devil's advocate a little bit because I don't see the other side so, quote unquote, represented that much. And I'm saying, okay, could it be also that if you believe in that, that that becomes your reality? That you can kind of put yourself in a box where everything is computation, and then you start seeing things as being such. It's confirmation bias, if you will, you know. This also reminds me, you know, I think a good analogy is, it's a friend of mine, Philip Koshin told me, that in France there is this literary movement which is called Oulipo. O-U-L-I-P-O. And it's a bunch of writers and mathematicians who create works of literature where in which they basically impose certain constraints. A good example of this is a novel which is called \"The Void,\" or \"Disappearance,\" by a writer named Georges Perec, which is a 300 page novel in French with no, which never uses the letter E, which is the most used, widely used letter of the French language. So in other words, he set this parameters for himself. I'm going to write a book where I don't use this letter,",

You see? So self-imposed limitation, that's how I see it. And I wonder why we should do that. Do we really need, do we really feel the urge to say the world is like that? The world can be explained this way or that way? And I'm saying it, you know, it's a personal question for me because I am addicted to knowledge myself. I, you know, \"Hi, my name is Edward.\" - [Lex] I'm addicted to knowledge. - \"And I'm a knowledge addict.\" Okay, I'm being serious, I'm not being facetious. Up until very recently, maybe a couple of years ago, I simply did not feel comfortable if I could not say, like, give an answer, explanation. It's like, oh, there has to be some explanation. And I tried to frantically search for it. Just for somebody like me, a nerd, you know, a left brainiac and, you know, that's kind of typical, typical for a scientist, for a mathematician. It is incredibly hard just to allow the possibility that it's a mystery and not to feel the urge to get the answer. It is incredibly hard. But possible and it is liberating, as a recovering, as a recovering addict to knowledge. Let me say what you gain from it, for instance. I understand the value of paradoxes. I appreciate paradoxes more. And you know, to use another philosopher, Soren Kierkegaard the Danish philosopher said, \"A thinker without paradox is like a lover without passion.\" A paltry mediocrity. - [Lex] Ooh, that's a good line. - Right?

But the opposite of a great truth is another great truth.\" In other words, things are not black and white, you know. They're not. And I would even venture to say the most interesting things in life are like that. The ones which are ambiguous. Is an electron a particle or a wave? It depends how you set up an experiment. It will reveal itself as this or that, depending on how you set up an experiment. This bottle, if you project it down onto the table, you will see more or less a square. If you project it onto a wall, you will see different shape. A naive question would be, \"Is it this or that?\" We understand that it's neither. But both projections reveal something. They reveal different sides of it. A paradox is like that. It's only paradoxical if we are confined in a particular vision. If we are wedded to a particular point of view. It's a harbinger, if you will, of a possibility of seeing things in a more, in a, as they are, as more sophisticated than we thought before. You see. - That's such a difficult idea for science to grapple with. - That, you know, I don't know how, there's so many ways to describe this, but you could say maybe that the subjective experience of the world from an observer is actually fundamental. - But we know that. Our best physical theories tell us that unambiguously, in quantum mechanics, actually, you know, Heisenberg I think captured it the best when he said, \"What we observe is not reality itself, but reality subjected to our method of questioning.\" When I talk about electrons, for instance, so there is a very specific way in which you, in which this is analyzed. There is a so-called double slate experiment, right? So for those who don't know, it's, you have a screen and you have a meter from which you send, you kind of throw, shoot electrons. And in between you put another screen, which has two vertical slits parallel to each other. If we were shooting, you know, tennis balls, each ball would go through one slit or another",

So there would be sort of bumps or spots of paint behind this or that. But that's not what happens when we shoot electrons. We see an interference pattern as if we were actually sending a wave. So that each electron, it seems like each electron goes through both slits at once and then, and then has the audacity to interfere with itself. Where at some points, you know, two crests would amplify, and at some points a crest and a trough would cancel each other. Yet, so that suggests, okay, so an electron is a wave, not so fast. Because if you put a detector behind one of the slits and you say, I'm going to capture you, I'm going to find out which slit you went through, the pattern will change and it will look like they are particles. So that's a very concrete realization of the idea that depending on how we set up an experiment, we will see different results. And the problem is that our psyche, I feel, is lagging behind in part because maybe our scientists are not doing such a great job. So I take responsibility for this, why haven't I explained this properly, you know? I tried, you know, with a bunch of talks and so on. So now I'm talking about this again. Our psyche kind of is lagging behind. We are still, even though our science has progressed so much from the certainty and the determinism and all of that of the 19th century, our psyche is somehow still attached to those ideas. The ideas of causality, of this naive determinism that the world is a bunch of billiard balls hitting each other, driven by some blind forces, you know. That's not at all like it is. And we've known this for over, for, well, for about a hundred years at least. You know? - And you call this self-imposed limitation. - It is a self-imposed limitation when we, when we pretend that, for instance, that this naive ideas of 19th century physics are still valid, and then start applying them to our lives, and then also derive conclusions from it. For instance people say, \"There is no freewill.\"",

It is not some kind of bullshit or some kind of, you know, concoction of a madman. This is our scientific theory, which has been confirmed by experiment. So we should pay attention to that. So, but of course, it's not just self-imposed limitation. Unfortunately, in this case, there is a big issue of education. So a lot of people are not aware of it through no fault of their own, because they were never properly taught that, because our system is broken, education system is broken, especially in math. And then our, so where do we get information? You get information from our scientists who actually write popular books and so on, which is a great, you know, great thing that they do. But a lot of scientists, somehow, when it comes to explaining the laws of physics, they're doing a fantastic job talking about this phenomenon. For instance, double slate experiment and things like that. But then, you know, interviewed by a science magazine about freewill and so on, they revert back to 19th century physics, as if those developments actually never happened. So to me, this is single most important sort of issue in our popular science. The idea that somehow there is this world out there, but it's complete, has nothing to do with me. So I can revel in the intricacies of these particles and their interactions, but completely ignore what implications this has for my own relationship to physical reality, to my own life, you know, because it's kind of scary, I guess, you know. - But also, what are the tools with which we can talk about the observer, the subjective view on reality? What are the tools of which we could talk about, rigorously talk about freewill and consciousness. What are the tools of mathematics that allow that? I don't think we have those tools. - Because we haven't been taught properly. So actually tools are there. For instance, I think, well, here we have to,",

I am supposed to be like this smart, intelligent person. I am afraid to say it and own it myself. I have to find confirmation, I have to find an authority who agrees with me.

And in the process of solving this equations he came up with square root of a negative number, specifically square root of minus 17. And he wrote that I have to forego some mental tortures to deal with it, but I am going to accept it and see what happens. And in fact, at the end of the four, at the end of the calculation, this weird numbers got canceled. They kind of canceled out. In the formula appeared square root of negative 17 and its negation.

That's just our past knowledge based on what our past knowledge is, and knowledge is limited. What if we make the next step? Today, for us mathematicians, complex numbers, that we call them, are not at all mysterious. The idea is simply that you plot real numbers, that is to say all the whole numbers like zero, one, and so on, two and so on, right? All fractions, like one half or three halves, or four over three. But then also numbers like square root of two or pi. We plot them as points on real line. So we draw, this is one of the kind of perennial concepts even in our very poor math curriculum at school.

Now it took another two or 300 years for mathematicians to figure that out, but initially it looked like a completely crazy idea.

And the amazing thing is that product, that multiplication satisfies the same rules, the same properties that are usual peroration of multiplication for real numbers.

The cruelty, the injustice of it. And I went through certain experiences as a kid, which made me love mathematics even more, as this place where I could be safe and in control. - Made you see the human world as lesser than the mathematical world. - Yes. - As more limited than the mathematical world. - Yes. Yes. And I think that, I think that it's still missing the mark in some sense, because, in fact, what I now think it's not, it's not a, it's a paradoxical, the question whether mathematics is invented or discovered, whether there is this world of pure forms and so on, is another paradoxical question which doesn't have a simple answer. Like whether electron is a particle or a wave. From one point of view, yes, it's true. And just the fact that so many mathematicians today actually subscribe to this idea gives it a certain credibility, because that's what we feel. We do feel that we dive into that mindscape, so to speak, you know, but the very structured mindscape where, you know, I wrote in \"Love and Math\" that, you know, the enchanted gardens of platonic reality, you know, so where all this fruit grows, you know, and then we might make sure. It gives you this sort of romantic sense of an explorer. And someone may be stuck in a, you know, some provincial town in Russia, for instance, but have the sense of Magellan, you know, of traveling around the world. It's just not in the world that we usually think of. So it's one point of view. But the other point of view is that yes, it is a human process, of course it is. I mean, it is, you cannot deny that. It's human beings who have so far discovered new mathematics.",

That we exist in the world of not forms, but of paradoxes. - Bingo. And so it's like what I say. (Lex laughs) But if you think it's weird, and I agree with you, as a recovering addict to knowledge, you know, but I am liking it more and more because there's so much freedom in it. And like Niels Bohr said, you know, I quoted that earlier. \"The opposite of a great truth is another great truth.\" He's pointing out to this fact that, you know, and he also said that some things in quantum physics are so complicated, the only way you can speak of them is in poetry. So in other words, what is it about poetry? What is it about art? Why are we so drawn to that? Why are we so captivated by those forms of, they're not intellectual necessarily. They're not, when you look at a painting that you like, when you listen to music that you love, you get lost in it. You get absorbed in it.

Is it really just some play between some kind of like xylophone play or some neurons hitting on each other? Is it really that only? Maybe. - It could be, it could be both. I'm just worried about kids these days that might live in a world of paradoxes. You know, if there's no God, everything is possible, and then just, they'll have a little too much fun and we have to put a constraint to the fun. - But have you looked at the world lately? - I haven't checked in in a while. - You think it's perfect the way it is now?

You know, the axis of the Earth is rotating relative to the plane in which the Earth goes around the Sun. And the period of this revolution is around 2000 years. So there is a traditional way of measuring that by this eras, you know, the ages. So the previous one was called the Age of Pisces, because of the constellation of Pisces that it points to, so to speak, you know.

So the different people dated differently, but somewhere around the time where we are finding ourselves. How interesting, right, there's all the strife and all the difficulties the world is experiencing, this might actually be the transition to something more harmonious. Wouldn't it be nice? - It's also interesting that people from long ago are able to predict certain things. And it's almost like from long ago, and you've talked about this with Pythagoras, that it seems that they had a deep sense of truth. - That's right. - That's sort of permeates all of this, even now. So it's not just a linear trajectory of an expanding knowledge. - Right. - There's a deep truth that permeates the whole thing. - Yes, so that's how I see it. Actually, I, you know, I gave a talk about Pythagoras and Pythagoreans just a few weeks ago at the Commonwealth Club of California in San Francisco. And because of that, I did a kind of a deep dive into the subject. And I learned that I actually totally misunderstood Pythagoras and Pythagoreans. That they were much deeper than I thought.

So for them, numbers were not just clerical devices. You know. Not kind of thing that you would use in accounting only. They were imbued with the divine, and I cannot, I cannot say that I think we lost it, at least I have lost it. I look at numbers and I don't really see that. - [Lex] The divine? - The divine. But they clearly did and so the, why else, you know, how else would you explain? So in other words, divine is of course, is a term which is, you know, it's a bit loaded, so it's hard to escape that. Let's just say something that more from the world of imagination and intuition than from the world of knowledge, let's just put this way. They were able to divine, okay, strike that, to intuit. To intuit that the planets were not revolving, and the Sun and the planets were not revolving around the Earth. They were the first ones, at least in the Western culture, as far as I know. And in fact, Copernicus gave credit to Pythagoreans as being his predecessors. They did not quite have the Copernicus model with the Sun in the middle. They had what they called the central fire in the middle. And all the planets and the Sun were revolving around, around the central fire, or hearth, they called it hearth. So, but still, what a departure from the dogma, from the knowledge of the era that the Earth was at the center. So how could they come up with this idea? The reason was, in my opinion, that for them, the movement of celestial borders was like music. In fact, we call it musica universalis or music of the spheres. For them, the universe was this infinite symphony in which every being, you know, humans, animals, as well as the Earth and other celestial bodies, were moving in harmony, like different notes of different instruments in a symphony.",

In other words, they always, they always knew that there is more. And they knew also that every pattern that you detect is finite, but the world is infinite. They actually accepted infinity, they believed that infinity is real. And if you discern a pattern, great. You can play with it and you can use that. It gives you a certain lens through which to see the world in a particular way, which could be beneficial for you to learn more and so on. But they never had the illusion that that was the final word. That they always knew that it's not the whole thing. So there is more. There are more sophisticated patterns that could be discovered using mathematics or otherwise. And I think that what happened was we kind of lost this other side of their teachings. We took their numbers and they were like idea that you could use mathematics to discern patterns and to find regularities and to explain things about the world. We took that and we ran with it. And we kind of dropped the other idea that in fact there is a, there is another side to it. Which is kind of, to us now, we say, oh, that's mystical.

So, you know, Nietzsche had this book, wrote this book in the 19th century called \"The Birth of Strategy.\" And he presented this theory, which I think is kind of very useful, of this two sides of a human. One that comes from God Apollo, and that's our left brain, so to speak, proverbial left brain. So everything has to do with, that has to do with logic and reason and analyzing, dissecting, conceptualizing. And the other side, which comes from God Dionysus, and that's responsible for intuition, imagination, love. Dionysus was also God of wine. So it's also that side of human that makes us sing and engage in, you know, revelry, and drink wine and spend time with friends and laugh and enjoy it, you know? So Nietzsche advocated this point of view that those were two complementary sides of every human, as well as society. And the purpose of human life is to find balance between them. - So math is both discovered and invented. We should be okay with having both ideas in our head and living the balance. - But more importantly, for me, Apollo is like math and Dionysus is like love. So Dionysus and Apollo, in modern version, is love and math. - I return to that question we had about GPT and the language models, and I think about this quite a lot, which is when the model, and we know it is trained on, we know the parameters, we know all the different hacks that are involved in the training process and the fine tuning process. And the final results, whether it's GPT-5, 6 or 7, will result in hundreds of millions of people falling deeply in love with that language model. And to be able to have conversations that are very much like the conversations we have with somebody we're deeply in love with. And not only that. The model will say it is deeply in love with us. And who are we to say it is not. I think there's, it's the same imperative that you described in the scientific mind that wants to throw away this objective.

But what if my, what I consider my subjective unique feelings are also- - [Lex] Novels you were fed. - The reverberations of the novels I have read because I have learned, or movies I have seen. Because that's the purpose of movies, kind of to teach us how to express ourselves, how to feel. Maybe even one could argue that, some people have argued that. I agree that this is, there is no obvious answer to this. But see, that's exactly my point. That is an example of something which is paradoxical, for which there is no answer.

For someone, that type of interaction would be helpful, would be consoling, would feel, would, you know, make them happy or sad or whatever, you know, would kind of strike the nerve. For some it won't. And I agree with you that in principle, there is no one to judge this. This is where subjective is paramount. But remember, a lot of this has been anticipated by artists. The great movie \"Her\", there you have this guy who is this lonely, he kind of writes letters- - The romantic letters. - The romantic for other people. But he doesn't have a partner. He's lonely.

The guy did not have the courage to go out in the real world and to meet a woman and to, you know, get a girlfriend and so on. Through no fault of his own, perhaps, because, you know, he may have had some experiences which made him withdrawn, enclosed and so on. And a lot of us are like this, you know. I had periods like that myself. Definitely can sympathize and relate. However, part of the joy of having this Siri-like relationship for him, one could say, was the absence of that fear that she would abandon him, which prevented him from initiating a relationship with a human being. And yet it turns out that he could be betrayed, quote unquote. That she could be unfaithful to him, quote unquote, anyway. So then that means that it did not resolve the underlying fear, having that relationship. So in other words, that human element of the relationship still found its way into the seemingly sterilized, protected partnership. So the human being rears its head anyway. - And I think the lesson there is that the system in the movie \"Her\" actually gave him a lesson that even AI could betray you, even AI can leave you, even AI can be unfaithful to you. And I would argue that the next AI he meets will be one he actually falls in deep love with because he knows the possibility of betrayal is there. The possibility of death is there. The possibility of infidelity is there. Because we need that possibility to truly feel close. - Or, or he would turn off his Siri program- - And finally- - and get out of his house. Go to a local bar and strike a conversation with a human being. Although you might say by then some of those might be androids. So. - And we don't even have",

So on the one side, there is this impulse of finding a theory, and then there is another impulse to escape from what has already been known. So one, in other words, like in my basic example, is one impulse to say everything is the real number, square root of negative one doesn't exist.

He moved to the United States before Second World War and worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he was a colleague of Einstein and other great scientists, von Neumann, Hermann Weyl and so on.

An example would be, so that one of the very first formal systems was the system, was Euclidean geometry developed by Euclid in his famous book \"Elements\", about 2200 years ago. And it's about, it's, well, it's a subject familiar from school 'cause we study it. But what it's really about is about the geometry of the plane and the plane, by plane I mean just this table top extended to infinity in all directions. Kind of a perfect plane, a perfectly even table. And so Euclidean geometry is about very geometric figures on the plane, specifically lines, triangles, circles, things like that. So what's an example of an axiom? An example of an axiom is that if you have two points, which are not, which are distinct, two points on the plane, then there is a unique line which passes through them. Now, kind of sounds reasonable, but this is an example of an action. In mathematics, you have to have a seed, so to speak. You have to start with something and you have to choose certain postulates or statements which you simply take for granted, which do not require proof. Usually they are ones which are kind of intuitively clear to you. But in any case, you cannot have, you cannot have any mathematics without choosing those actions. - And you refer to those as the observer because they're kind of subjective. - The observer comes in the process of choosing the axioms. Who chooses the axioms? - [Lex] The turtles, that is all sitting on top of. - Exactly, as Alan Watts, you know, like to say, \"Who is watching the watcher?\" - Yeah. - And so in mathematics, but you see mathematicians are so clever.

And so Euclidean geometry is actually a good illustration of this because Euclid had five axioms. Four of them were kind of obvious, like the one I just mentioned. And the fifth, which came to be known famously as the fifth postulate, was that if you have a line and you have a point outside of this line, there is a unique line passing through that point, which is parallel to the first line, meaning that doesn't intersect it. And Euclid himself was uncomfortable about this because he felt that it was kind of a, you know, that he takes for granted something that is not obvious. And for many centuries after that, mathematicians were trying to derive this axion from other axioms, which were more obvious in some sense. And they failed. And it was only almost 2000 years later that mathematicians realized that you can't, not only you cannot derive, but you can actually replace it with its opposite. And you'll still get a bonafide, a consistent, not self-contradictory, which is called non-Euclidean geometry. Which of course sounds very complicated, but it's not. Think of a sphere, just the surface of a basketball or the surface of the Earth, I know, idealized. The analogs, so you have points, you have analogs of lines, which are meridians, right? Every two meridians intersect. Unlike parallel lines on the flat space. There is also so-called hyperbolic plane where no, there are infinitely many lines which do not intersect. So every possibility can be realized. There are different flavors. This is a good illustration of what a formal system is. You start with a set of axions, those statements that you take for granted. And this is where you have a choice. And by making different choices, you actually create different mathematics. After that, there are rules of inference, logical rules, such as if A is true and A applies B, then B is true. Most of them were actually introduced already by Aristotle, even before Euclid. And then it runs as follows. You have the axioms, which are accepted as true statements.",

        "text": "Then you have a way to produce new statements by using the rules of logical inference from the axioms. Every statement you obtain you call a theorem, and you kind of add it to the collection of true statements. And then the question is, how far can you go? How many statements can you prove this way? Of course you want it to be, the system to be nontrivial in the sense that you don't prove everything. Because if you prove everything, it would mean that it's self-contradictory, that you prove a statement A, and its negation. So that's kind of useless. It has to be discriminating enough so that it doesn't prove contradictory statements. So there is already a question of that mathematician called consistency. It has to be consistent in the sense that it is not self-contradictory. And then the idea that was basically prevalent in the world of mathematics by the beginning of the 20th century, was that in principle, all of mathematics could be derived this way. We just have to find the correct system of axioms. And then everything you ever need would be, could be produced by this procedure, which is really algorithmic procedure, which actually could be run on the computer. Now think about it. What is special about this process? In this process, you are just manipulating symbols, basically. You're going from one statement to another without really understanding the meaning of it. So it's an ideal playground for a computer program. It's a purely syntactic process where there are some rules, some rigid rules of passing from one statement to the next. Most mathematicians believed that this way you can produce all true statements. And if this were true, it would give a lot of credibility to the thesis that everything in life is computational, or life is computational. Because then at least mathematics is computational, because then it can be programmed. And a computer, after sufficient time, depending on its capacity, would produce every true statement. So Godel's first incompleteness theorem says that that's not the case. And it not just says it, but it proves it at, you know, at the highest level of rigor",

If it is consistent, that is to say if it's not complete, completely useless, then there will be true statement in it, which cannot be derived by this linear syntactic process of proving theorems from axioms. It's really incredible. So this was a revolution 1931, a revolution in logic, revolution in mathematics. And we're still feeling the tremors of this discovery. - And the similar time, the computer's being born. The actual engineering of the computational system is being born. - Right. - Which is ironic- - Turing was, Turing was, Alan Turing, who is considered as the father of modern computing, right? So he actually did something very similar. So he had this halting problem. He proved that halting problem cannot be solved algorithmically. That you cannot, out of all computer programs, roughly speaking, you cannot, you cannot have an algorithm of choosing out of all possible computer programs, which ones are meaningful, which ones will not, which ones will halt. - Very depressing results all across the table. - [Edward] Or, on the contrary, life-affirming. Depends on your point of view. - Because everything is full of paradoxes. - So that means, so, you're right, it's depressing if we are sold on a certain idea from the outset, and then suddenly this doesn't pan out. But, okay, to which my, I retort, what if you proved that actually, you know, everything can be proved. So then what? What is left to do if you're a mathematician? So that will be depressing to me.

Maybe in the framework of that concept, some other things will become possible, you know.

I often return to Game of Life. - [Edward] Yeah. - And just look at the thing. - Amazing, right? - And wonder- - The kind of things they can do with such a small, you know, tools. - That from simpler rules, a distributed system can create complex behavior. And it makes you wonder that maybe the thing we'll call computation is simple at the base layer, but when you start looking at greater and greater layers of abstraction, you zoom out with blurry vision. Maybe after a few drinks you start to see something that's much, much much more complicated and interesting and beautiful than the original rules that our scientific intuition says cannot possibly produce complexity and beauty. I don't know, I don't know if anyone has a good answer, a good model of why stuff emerges. Why complexity emerges from a lot of simple things.

Then there is this duck rabbit picture where, you can Google it. If somebody doesn't know they can Google it and find it. It's very easy. Actually, Ludwig Wiggenstein devoted several pages, duck rabbit, in his book, and so on, there are many others. There are like the squares where you can see, a square you can see from different perspective this way, that way, and so on. So when we talk about neural networks, we're talking about training data and stuff so that you have some pictures, for example, that you feed to your program and you try to find the most optimal neural network, which would be able to decide which one is it, is it the dog or a cat or whatever. But sometimes it doesn't have a definite answer. So what do you do then? So do, actually, it's a question, I actually don't know. Has modern AI even come to appreciate this question that actually sometimes you can have a picture on which you cannot say what is in it. From one perspective, it's a rabbit,",

How are you supposed to train if you have a neural network, which is supposed to discriminate between, distinguish between ducks and rabbits, how is it going to process this, you see? - Well, so the trivial trick it does is to say there's a, this X probability that it's a duck and this probability that it's a rabbit. - Well, that's a good approach, but also I would say there is no like given percentages. For instance, actually at some point I was really curious about it and I looked, and for some, for each picture of this nature, and there are a bunch of them you can easily find online, my mind immediately interprets it in a particular way. But because I know that other people have, could see it differently, I would then strain my mind and strain my eyes and stare at it and try to see it in a different way. And sometimes I could see it right away and then I could go back and forth between the two. And sometimes it could, it took me a while for some pictures. So in that sense, even if these probabilities exist, they are subjective. Some people immediately see it this way. Some people immediately see it that way. And I think that nobody knows, not psychologists, not neuroscientist, not philosophers, what to make of it. The best answer, of course as a scientific mind, even though I say no, don't look for interpretation. Leave some place for mysticism or mystery, right? I say that. But of course I want a theory, I want an explanation. So the best explanation I find is from Niels Bohr's Complementarity Principle. So it is like particle and wave, that there are different ways to look at it. And when you look at it in a particular way, the other side will be obscured. Think about it like the other side of the Moon, you know? So like we are observing the Moon from one side and then we don't see the other side. There is a complementary perspective where we see the other side, but not the side we normally see. But the Moon is the same. It's still there. It's our limitations of being able to grasp the whole.

Or with ChatGPT that it's using, reinforcement learning by human feedback. We're actually using a set of humans to teach the networks. - Yes. - And that's the thing that people don't often talk about because, or I sometimes think about that those humans all have a life story. Each human that annotated data, that fed data to the network or did the RLHF, they have a life story. They grew up, they have biases. - They have biases, there's some things that they like, there's some things they don't like, which can kind of appear under their radar screen. They may not be aware that they are exercising those biases. That's the point. What you brought up is a very important issue here. Not so much issue, but it's not a bug, it's a feature in my opinion that implicit in the discussion of the question is thinking computational and so on, is the idea that our conscious awareness covers everything within our psyche. And we just know that that's not the case. We have, all of us have observed other people who have had sort of destructive tendencies. So obviously they did things destructive for themselves and many of us have observed ourselves too doing that, as part of human nature, right? So, and there is great research in analytic psychology and, you know, in the past hundred years, strongly suggesting, if not proving, the existence of what Carl Jung called the personal unconscious and also collective unconscious. The kind of circle of ideas which are under the radar screen, which lead us to some strong emotions and inspire us to act in certain ways, even if we cannot really understand. So if we accept that, then the proposition that somehow everything can still be covered by our actions, which are totally kind of neutral and totally like righteous and totally conscious, that it becomes really (indistinct).",

What to you is the most beautiful idea in mathematics? Another one we can ask is what to you is the most beautiful equation in mathematics? - Well, I mean. - I may have just broken your brain. Because what your brain is doing is walking down a long memory lane of beautiful experiences. - Well, you see in mathematics, we have this idea that there, we have an idea of a set, right? So collection of things, for instance. You know, the set of tables, the set of chairs and so on, one set of microphones. But could be set of numbers. Could be set of ideas. Could be a set of formulas, mathematical equations. And then we have the notion of an ordered set, ordered like the set in which there is order. Which means that for every two members of the set, we'll say which one is better than the other or greater than the other. For instance, all numbers are ordered. Five is greater than three, five is less than seven, and so on. But not all sets are ordered. So the set of beautiful theorems is not what, beautiful equations is not ordered. So in other words, there are many best equations. And so Richard Feynman chose one, which I think one of the best is that if you take e, the base of natural algorithm to the power pi, so you have pi, you have e in it, the base of natural algorithm. You have pi, i, which is square root of negative one, and the result is negative one. So that's up there for sure in the pantheon of beautiful formulas, you know, that every, I think pretty much every mathematician would agree. I don't know what my favorite one is. - Just lingering on that one, Euler's Identity. What makes it beautiful? Just a few symbols together. I mean, part of it is actually just trying to define what is beautiful about mathematics that is laid in there in this particular equation",

We always think of pi as the ratio between the circumference of a circle and its diameter. Here we are taking some number to the power pi, not even pi mind you, but pi multiplied by square root of negative one. Surely this is something completely incomprehensible and yet the result is negative one. You see. And if you take e to the power two pi i, you get one, actually one. So I would guess that that's, but in other words, the initial reaction is just that it was surprise, I guess. I guess for anyone who first comes across. - That these three folks, four folks got together. It reminds me of the idea that Hitler, Stalin, Trotsky and Freud were all in Vienna in some early, at the beginning of the '20s - And Victor Stein was a classmate of Hitler. You know this. - I did not know this, no. - Yeah. - So they're, it makes you, you know, you can imagine a situation where they're all sitting at a bar together at some point, not knowing it, but they somehow, it all made sense in space time to be located there. And that's what this feels like, some kind of intersection. - Intersection, yes. But I would say that after the initial shock, you look at the proof of this equation, and it actually does make sense. And actually it is nothing but the statement that the circumference of the circle is. And in fact in this case, it's the circumstance of a semicircle is equal to pi.

And I would be like, no, you know, the story was terrible. Suddenly I didn't see him anymore. I had to, you know? So now it makes me question, who was creating the trouble? - [Lex] What was all within you? - Was it him who was creating the story and the trouble or was it my mind? You see? And so as I become, as I became self-aware, suddenly other possibilities opened and suddenly that conflict, which, by the way, if I kept giving this nasty, you know, talks about him, one day I suppose we'd have a debate. And so you have this one person says this, and then. And what I learned is that it's a never-ending conflict. This conflict just does not end. But there is an alternative, there is a better way, which is to realize that it is you arguing with yourself. Now, if you want to continue arguing with yourself, continue. As long as you need. Just be careful not to destroy too many things, you know, in the process. But there is an option of actually dropping it, of actually dropping it. This is so, I was so surprised by this. - Yeah, just discovering in yourself the capacity, the human capacity for compassion. And you understand that he has a perspective. He is operating in the space of imagination, a human being like you. And we're all in this kind of together trying to figure this out. - We're all in the same boat. Ultimately. And also it's like with realizing how much I have screwed up, you know, comes this humility also. So like I find it extremely hard now to like really lash out at somebody and to say like, \"You're horrible,\" whatever. Because immediately question is, \"Who am I to criticize?\" You know? So is there another way to have a dialogue? Is there a way to, you know, speaking, you know, since we talked about the innocence of a child and how much it drives a discovery in science",

So you come out, it's like, \"Hey, you wanna play?\" You don't talk about what happened, you don't rehash this, you know, just keep going.

Like yeah, but no, no what matters to you, but like there are other ways to approach other people. There are other ways you can find point of contact. Speaking of which, mathematics. Mathematical formulas are universal. Represent universal knowledge. Two plus two is four. Whether you vote for this guy or that guy in the election. You know, how about that as point of contact of commonality? You know? And nobody can patent those formulas, did you know that? There is a Supreme Court decision that mathematical formulas cannot be patented. Like Einstein could not patent E equals MC squared. It doesn't belong to him, because if the formula is correct, then it belongs to everyone. - So what do you think of that all too tricky question? And if you want, I can deeply bias your answer by giving the list of four that Eric provided. - Oh no, let me give mine. I cannot see, by the way, what you have, so. But I can guess some of them. So I'm going to try to do something different from him. So I already mentioned one, which is that you have one-dimensional numerical system, which is real numbers. You have two-dimensional, which is complex numbers. You have four-dimensional and it's kind, it's probably connected to what he wrote because has to do with some homotopy groups of spheres",

So one plus two plus three plus four plus five, ostensibly diverges, goes to infinity. 'Cause you get a bigger and bigger number. And yet there is a way to make sense of it, in which it comes up to minus one over 12. How fascinating. First of all, the answer is not even a positive number and it's not an integer, it's not a whole number, it's minus one over 12. So sometimes people ask me, \"What is your favorite number?\" And as kind of a joke I say, \"Minus one over 12.\" It's actually 42. - So your favorite number is not an ordered set. - Right. - So what else? - What else? - So- - [Edward] Langlands program, of course, I have to mention that. - And we'll explore that in depth.

It's very closely connected to the fact that we have elementary particles of two types, bosons and fermions. So bosons are, for examples, photons or carriers of other forces, or the Higgs Boson. It is called a boson for a reason, because it is a boson, in honor of a Indian mathematician, Bose, B-O-S-E, and Einstein. So this particles obey what's called Bose-Einstein statistics. But then there are other particles called fermions, in honor of Enrico Fermi, Italian born mathematician who worked in the U.S. And they follow what's called Dirac Fermi statistics. And those are electrons and, constituents of matter, electrons, protons, neutrons, and so on. And they have a certain duplicity, if you will, and that duplicity is rooted mathematically in this experiment, this little experiment that I have just done. So I can, I imagine, speaking of imagination, okay. So I'm just kind of riffing on this.

It's really PTSD.

We have to talk about it. - [Edward] Sure. - At the core of your book and your work is the Langlands program. Can you describe what it is? - Sure. So Langlands is a mathematician. It's the name of a mathematician, Robert Langlands. Canadian born, still alive. He was a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study that we talked about where Einstein and Godel and other great scientists have worked. In fact, he used to occupy the office of Albert Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study. So he, in the late '60s, he came up with a set of ideas which captivated a lot of mathematicians, several generations of mathematicians by now, which came to be known as the Langlands program. And what it is about is connecting different fields of mathematics, which seem to be far away from each other. For example, number theory, which, as the name suggests, deals with numbers, and various equations with, you know, like X squared plus Y squared equals one. And on the other side, harmonic analysis. Something that any music lover can appreciate because the sound of a symphony can be kind of decomposed into sounds of different instruments. And each of those sounds can be represented by a wave like this, like a sine function. Those are the harmonics.",

But they all combine together into something special, which is not, cannot be reduced to any one of those. So it's the, mathematically, it's the idea that you can decompose a signal into, as a collection, as a simultaneous oscillation of several elementary signals. That's called harmonic analysis. So what Langlands found is that some really difficult questions in number theory can be translated into much more easily tractable questions in harmonic analysis. That was his initial idea. But what happened next surprised everybody. That the kind of patterns that he was able to observe, the kind of regularities that he was able to observe, which were quite surprising, were subsequently found in other areas of mathematics. For example, in geometry. And eventually in quantum physics. So in fact, Ed Witten, who is a kind of a dean of modern theoretical physicists, a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study as well, got interested in this subject. I describe in my book how it happened. And he was instrumental in bridging the gap between this patterns found in physics and in geometry, finding kind of a substrat, a kind of a super stratum, if you will. It's kind of over, kind of a way to connect these two things, kind of a bridge between these two fields. So subsequently I collaborate with Witten on this, and this has been one of the major themes of my research. It's sort of, I always found it interesting to connect things, to unite things. When I was younger, I couldn't understand why, but I was always interested in when, not in working in specific field but kind of cutting across fields. And then I would discover that, for instance, I took some people who know what happens in this field, but don't know what happens in the other field, or conversely, and then I would like find it imperative to go out and explain to them, to the different sides, what this is all about, so that more people are aware of this hidden structure,",

And so I guess, you know, now I kind of understand more why it's kind of a balance, you know, like the, what we talked about earlier. - So can you elucidate a little bit how, what are the mathematical tools that allow you to connect these different continents of mathematics. Is there something you can convert into words that Langlands was able to find and you were able to explore further? - I would say what it suggests is that there is some hidden principles, which we still don't understand. My view is that we still don't know why. That we can prove some instances of this correspondences and connections, but we still don't know the real underlying reasons, which means that there is a new layer, there's a certain layer beneath the surface that we see now. It is like the, so the way I see it now is like this. That there is something three-dimensional, like this bottle, but what we are seeing is this projection onto the table and the projection onto the wall, and then we can map things from one projection to another. And they say, \"Oh my God, that's incredible!\" But the real explanation is that both of them are projections of the same thing, and that we haven't found yet. But that's what I want to fight, so that's what motivates me, I would say. - From number theory to geometry to quantum physics. - So there is this one thing which has different projections, except it's not just the table and the wall, but there are like many different walls, if you will. - So what is the philosophical implication that there is commonalities like that across these very disparate fields? - It means that what we believe are the fundamental elements of mathematics, are not fundamental. There is something beyond. It's like we previously thought that atoms were indivisible, then we found out that there is a nucleus and electrons and the nucleus consists of proteins and neutrons. Then we thought, okay, protons and neutrons must be elementary. Now we know they consist of quarks. So it's about kind of finding the quarks of mathematics.",

Fascinating. I enjoyed it very much. I also felt I have to keep up, you know? And so we wrote this long paper in 2007 and we collaborated for about a year. I have known him before and we talked before and we have, I have seen him since and we talked, but it's very different to just meet somebody at conferences and have a conversation as opposed to actually working on a project together. So he's very, very, very, very serious, very focused. This is one thing which I have to say. I was really struck by this. - Why is he considered to be such a powerful intellect by many other powerful intellects? - He had a, he has had this unique vision of the subject. He was able to connect different things. Especially find connections between quantum physics and mathematics, almost unparalleled. I don't think anyone comes close, in some sense, in the last, you know, 50 years, to him, in terms of finding, just consistently, time after time, breaking ground, new ground, new ground. So he would basically, one way one could describe it is he would take some idea in physics and then find an interpretation of it in mathematics, and then say distill it, present it in mathematical terms and tell mathematicians this should be like that. You know? Kind of like one plus two plus three plus four is minus one over 12. And mathematics would be like, \"No way!\" And then it would pan out and mathematicians would then, like a whole industry would be created of groups of mathematicians trying to prove his conjectures and his ideas.

He's probably the physicist who kind of could learn mathematics the fastest, I don't think. Some younger physicists maybe could come close, but it's still quite, for them, a long way to go to get, you know, to be comparable to Witten. To take some of the most sophisticated mathematics and learn it to the point where he becomes a practitioner of the subject practically, and then use it to gain some new insights on the physics side. Now, of course, the thing is that the theory is that physics, one could say, is in sort of a crisis in some sense, because of a current gap between the sophisticated theories, which came from applying sophisticated mathematics, and the actual universe. So we have theories, for instance, which describe 10-dimensional worlds, 10-dimensional space time coming from string theory and things like that. But we don't know yet how to apply it to understanding our universe. A lot of progress has been made, but it's kind of a, at a kind of impasse right now. And at the same time our most realistic theories, most advanced theories of the four-dimensional universe are in contradiction with each other. The standard model describing the three known forces of nature, the electromagnetic, strong and weak, with great accuracy. And Einstein's relativity, which describes the fourth, called gravity. Everybody above a certain age knows that one. - [Lex] Yeah. - So these two theories are in contradiction at the moment. And string theory was one of the, the promise of string theory was that it would unify those two. And so far it has not happened. So we are kind of at a very interesting place right now, and I think that new ideas perhaps are needed and I wouldn't be surprised if Witten is one of those people who come up with those ideas. - Well, he has been one of the, one of the people that added a lot of ideas",

Every human is a vibration, every animal, you know, every being, every tree, and every celestial body and so on. So string theory is kind of like that because in string theory there is this fundamental object, which is a vibrating string. And all particles are, in a sense, supposed to be different modulations or vibrations of that string. So that by itself is already interesting, that you kind of describe this diversity of various particles and interactions between them, using one guiding principle in some sense. But also just the mathematical things that come out of it. The kind of, it looks impossible to satisfy various constraints, and then there is sort of like the unique way to do it. So that's sort of the, every time that happens, when, you know, you have some system over, like over-determined system. Let's suppose you have to do like five interviews in one day, and you wake up in the morning and you're like, that's impossible, because then so many things have to align. For instance, let's suppose you have to go from one place to another, so then you have a commute, and then who knows, maybe there is a traffic jam and stuff like that. And now suppose it all works seamlessly and there were like a bunch of places where it could have gone hopelessly wrong, and it didn't. And then in the evening you're like, wow, it worked. That's beautiful, right? That's kind of like great luck, you know, we would say. But in science this happens sometimes, that you have this theory which is not supposed to work, because there's so many seemingly contradictory demands on it.

But I meant it as kind of a tongue in cheek. - But isn't it a little bit kind of that? - It's not really, because first of all, it doesn't cover all fields of mathematics and it covers specific phenomena. - But isn't it spiritually striving towards the same platonic form of a theory of everything? Like connecting, connecting- - Connecting, but connecting doesn't mean that it covers- - Unified? - everything. Right, so you could connect two things and then you have infinitely many other things which are outside of the purview of this connection. That's how it is in mathematics, I feel. And I would venture to say that most mathematicians look at it this way. Like there is no idea that somehow, I think it's actually impossible because we're not talking about such a thing as like one universe. We're talking about all possible universes of all possible dimensions and so on. It is just not feasible to have a unified, unify everything in one equation.

I think that a lot of people do agree that this debate is kind of, I feel like it's kind of settled. I think, I hear it less and less.

So I think you spoke to the second thing, which is basically that the pursuit of a theory of everything becomes like a drug to the human ego. - That's right. So it's a huge motivating factor, I don't deny that. But I feel that it's, there are better ways to motivate people than like that, than this way, okay. So I would say for instance, if one, because then it's not a game of winner takes all, in some sense. And in fairness, when physicists say theory of everything, grand unified theory, they mean something very specific, which is unifying the standard model and Einstein's relativity theory, which is the theory of gravity. So they don't necessary, a lot of physicists may say this words, but they don't really mean them. I think it's important to realize that, that in my opinion, that's not productive and it's not feasible anyway. So having said that, there are some theories are better than others, obviously. So for instance, Eric's theory has a, as far as I understand, does have a certain way of producing some of the elementary particles that we see, and as well as the force of gravity.

And he's trying to do it for curved spaces and greater generality, which is what makes it so unique and so beautiful. But then there are, on top of that, there are all this issues of quantization, of actually describing them as quantum field theory. And the quantum field theory, even as a language, as a framework, is currently incomplete, in my opinion. And not only my opinion, it's like everybody's. Everybody agrees on that that it's a, it's a collection of tricks, so to speak. It's a collection of tools, it's a toolbox. But it is not a consistent rigorous theory like number theory in mathematics. Physicists have still been able to derive predictions from it, and confirm them to great accuracy. But the underpinnings, it doesn't have the real rigorous foundation from mathematical perspective. So in that sense, even if in that framework a new theory could lead to an explanation of some, some new explanation of some phenomena, it would still be incomplete in a sense because it wouldn't be mathematically rigorous.

Do you think such equation exists? - Yeah, there are such equation. For instance, let's say I am interested in particular question, right? So in the Langlands program, say, so moving away from physics, so let's talk about math. So in the context of Langlands program, I have recently developed with my co-authors, Etingof and Kazhdan, kind of a new strand, a new flavor of the Langlands program, if you will.",

It seems somehow simple. The nature of reality, the thing that governs it seems to be simple. I wonder why that is.

So inside academia and outside. What is the difference of doing mathematics inside academia and outside? Just not even mathematics, but developing beautiful original ideas.

It's really hard to do it being outside. Now Eric is unique in this way, even though he did, you know, go to undergraduate and graduate, you know, schools. And then worked for a while in academia. There are very few examples like that. There is Yitang Zhang who proved an important conjecture numbers theory about 10 years ago, and is now, as I understand, is a professor at UC Santa Barbara. He worked outside of academia and was able to make a tremendous advance on his own. This case is exceedingly rare, in part because academia is trying to protect its turf and it's kind of, it's creating the sort of prohibitive cost of an outsider, that is true. But there is also something about how much, how much concentration. In mathematics, I don't think people who are not, who are not in the field understand what kind of focus and concentration actually doing, like mathematics at the top level these days requires, because we are not talking about something that is more or less good. It is something which is unassailable, you know. It's finding this treasure at the bottom of the ocean, you know, without, you know, the aqualung, you know, without oxygen. And that's why, you know, it's not, people go crazy sometimes, you know.

So for your own life and what you've observed, let me ask the big question. How to think. How to think deeply. How to find the mental, psychological, pragmatic space to really sit there and think deeply. How do you do it? In the moments you remember where you really deeply thought, was it an accident, was it deliberate? - No, it's deliberate because, you know, first of all, my first years as a mathematician, you know, I worked every day, weekends, holidays, doesn't matter. I didn't even question that. So I would feel something's missing if I took a day off. And, you know, so it was just a kind of a sustained effort. The point is that still the process is non-linear, to go back to what we discussed earlier. That in other words, the way I see it is you just, you are making an effort to bring all the information into focus, what you believe is correct, and you're playing with different ways of connecting things. But it is a total miracle when it, when suddenly there is inside strikes. It is not something that in my experience could be predicted or even anticipated, you know, or like brought closer. There is a famous story about Einstein that he used to, you know, go, think, think, think, and then go for a walk. And like he would whistle and sometimes. So I remember the first time I heard this story, I thought, hmm, how interesting. What a coincidence that this came to him when he was whistling. But in fact it's not. This is how it works in some sense, that you have to prepare for it, but then it happens when you stop thinking actually. So the moment of discovery is the moment when thinking stops. And in a way you kind of, you kind of almost become that truth that you're seeking. But you cannot do it by will in some sense.

The point is that we're talking about such an esoteric area, mathematics is really esoteric area. It's a really strange subject where you try to feed everything in this very, very stringent set of rules. - Isn't it- - To obey those set, those rules. - Isn't it basically the pure, the hardest manifestation of a puzzle that we're all solving in different other disciplines, but this is the hardest puzzle? - But yes or no, because there is just a different, for instance, there is a different criterion for what constitutes progress. For instance, physics, a lot of arguments they make, they're not rigorous, from mathematical perspective. It is kind of an intuitive argument. We think it is like this, and this is acceptable in the subject for a good reason. And on the, so there is some play, it's more like human activity, day-to-day activity. Like for instance if you and I discuss something, you have an idea and I have an idea and then we argue about it and something seems more plausible, something seems less plausible. And so we may decide to take this point of view or that point of view as a provisional sort of like point of view and go with it. In mathematics it doesn't work this way. You either prove it or you don't. And oftentimes you get to the point where there is this much you need to prove and it just, it just wouldn't come to you, and you just don't see it.

And there is this one stubborn thing which just does not compute, you know, doesn't happen.

But in mathematics, you know, and within this particular framework, I think that I always feel optimistic when people ask me to explain something. I always start with the assumption that they will understand, you know. So let's try. Fermat's Last Theorem, one of the jewels, sort of, of mathematics of all time. A beautiful story also behind it. Pierre Fermat, a great French mathematician who lived at the beginning of, mostly worked at the beginning of, what, 17th century. And he actually has to his credit a number of important contributions. But the most famous is called Fermat's Last Theorem, or Fermat's Great Theorem. And the reason why it became so famous is in part because he actually claimed to have proved it himself. And he did it on a margin of a book that he was reading, which was actually an important book by Diophantus about equations with coefficients in whole numbers. And he wrote on the margin, literally, this equation, you know, this problem, which I will explain in a moment. \"I have solved it, I have found a proof,",

So this was 17th century Twitter style proof, okay? But a lot of mathematicians took it seriously because he had great credibility. He did make some major contributions. And the search was on. So for 350 years, about 350 years, it remained unproved, with many people trying and failing, until in 1994, no, in 1993, Andrew Wiles announced, a mathematician from Princeton University, announced the proof. And it was very exciting because he was one of the top number theorists in the world. And unfortunately about a year later a gap was found. So this is exactly what we were talking about earlier. You have 99% of the proof, this one little thing does not quite connect, and this nullifies the whole thing. Even though, well, you could say there are some interesting ideas, but it's not the same as actually having a proof. So he apparently was really frustrated and he was really, a lot of people thought that it's going to be another hundred years or whatever. And then luckily he was able to enlist, with the help, assistance of his former student, also great number theorist, Richard Taylor, they were able to do that 1%, so to speak. Well some people might say maybe not one but 5% or whatever. But it definitely was an important ingredient, but it was not, he had a sort of like a big new set of ideas and this one thing didn't pan out. They were able to close it with Taylor. And finally it was published and I think was accepted and refereed in '95, and since and is believed to be correct. Now what he proved actually was not Fermat's Theorem itself, but a certain statement which is called Shimura-Taniyama-Weil conjecture, named after three mathematicians, two Japanese mathematicians and one French born mathematician who worked also at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. And it was my colleague at UC Berkeley, Ken Ribet, who in the '80s connected the two problems.",

        "text": "So this is how it often works in mathematics. You want to prove statement A. Instead you prove that A is equivalent to B. So after that, if you can prove B, this would automatically imply that A is correct. So this is what happened here. A was Fermat's Last Theorem, B was Shimura-Taniyama-Weil conjecture, and that's what Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor really proved. So it requires, to get to Fermat's Last Theorem, it requires that bridge which was established by my colleague Ken Ribet, at UC Berkeley. So now what is the statement of Fermat's Last Theorem? Let me start with Pythagoras. Since we already talked about it, let me start with Pythagoras' Theorem, which describes the right triangles. So what is a right triangle? It's the triangle in which one of the angles is 90 degrees like this. So it has three sides. The longer side is called hypotenuse, and then there's two other sides. So if we denote the hypotenuse, the lengths of hypotheses by Z, and the two other sides X and Y, then Z squared is equal to X squared plus Y squared. So that's the equation. Or X squared plus Y squared equals Z squared. And it turns out that this equation has solutions in natural numbers, actually infinitely many solutions in natural numbers. For example, if X is, you take X equals three, Y equals four, and Z equals five, then they solve this equation, because three squared is nine, four squared is 16. Nine plus 16, 25. And that's five squared. So X squared plus Y squared equals Z squared is solved by X equals three, Y equals four, Z equals five. And there are many other solutions of that nature. - And we should say that natural numbers are whole numbers that are non-negative. - That's right. One, two, three, four, five, six and so on. Now, what's Fermat's Last Theorem? Fermat asked what about, what will happen if we replace squares by cubes, for example? So X cube plus Y cube equals Z cube.",

        "text": "Are there any solutions in, what do you call, natural numbers? It turns out there are none. What about fourth powers? Again, none. - Or it seems like none, right? - So that was, that was the statement. So the theorem says that the equation X cubed plus Y cubed equals Z cubed, has no solutions in natural numbers. Remember, natural means positive whole numbers. Of course there is a trivial solution, zero, zero, zero. So this works, but you need all of them to be positive. X to the fourth plus Y to the fourth equals Z to the fourth, also has no solutions X to the fifth plus Y to the fifth equals Z to the fifth. No solutions. So you kind of see the trend. X to the N plus Y to the N equals Z to the N. If N is greater than two, has no solutions in natural numbers. That is a statement of Fermat's Last Theorem. Deceptively simple, as far as famous theorems are concerned. You don't need to know anything beyond standard arithmetic. Addition and multiplication of natural numbers. That's why a lot of people, both specialists and amateurs, try to prove it. - It's so- - Because it's so easy, so easy to formulate. So in fact, I think Fermat proved the case of cubes. I think he did actually prove some elsewhere, the case of cubes. But so it remained like fourth. There are infinitely many cases, right? You have to, even if you prove it for cubes and for fourth power and fifth, then still there's six, seventh, and so on. There are infinitely many cases in which it has to be proved. And so you see the deceptively simple result took 350 years to prove. And, you know, but in a sense it's like mathematicians, you know, you would think mathematics is such a sterile profession. Everybody's so serious, you know, almost like we are all wearing like lab coats. And like take an elevator to the ivory tower. However, look at all this drama.

There have been some famous cases where people have been accused, which had been resolved or partially resolved or unresolved, and everybody knows it.

And oftentimes when you look at who wins the Nobel Prize, it's also tragic because sometimes so many minds are like, the trajectory to the breakthrough idea involves so many different minds, young and old. - Yeah, I mean. You're right. I think it's like everything else. The path is to more self-awareness. And it's like owning up your own stuff and not blaming other people, not projecting onto other people, but taking responsibility. And that's true for everything. And the problem here, unique problem for mathematics. I would say physicists and chemists are better. They have, they actually have better sort of ethical rules and so on. Especially biologists like. Because I think in part it's because there is much more money involved, because they have to get grants and so on. So for them, the question of priority, who discovered what first, is much more serious because there's really some serious money. In mathematics, who cares, you know, that Fermat's Last Theorem was proved. Did Andrew Wiles become a millionaire? No. As far as I know. - I think he got a prize. - He won a prize, but those prizes are not. - I think that one was a big prize, but in general, there's not going to- - He, I think he won the Abel Prize, eventually, which is about a million dollars. So, but, you know, sometimes I joke about this, that this is the hardest way to win a million dollars. So, you know, but amongst mathematicians, I think the trouble is that we are so insulated from society because it's such a pure subject. It draws in very specific psychological types. And I can speak about myself. I did not realize it at the time, but later on I definitely saw, I mentioned some of it earlier, that for me, mathematics was a refuge from the cruelty of the life I experienced, from discrimination that I experienced when I applied to Moscow University at 16,",

I want to hide in this platonic reality of pure forms. This is where I know how to operate. I love this. And I couldn't be bothered, in some sense, for a while, up to a point. As I was getting older and more mature, I was becoming more and more interested in other things. But I think that's one of the reasons. And one of the reasons why I wrote \"Love and Math\" was precisely to break that cycle. That it's the quiet guy in the corner that goes into math and not the flamboyant, you know, jock or like, you know, DJ. I wanted to show how beautiful the subject is to attract this new blood, so that different psychological types and more women would join. Because then they would have the students who would look at them and whom they will inspire. And then it would be a, instead of a vicious circle, it would be a virtuous circle. And I have to say, I think it's happening, not because of my efforts alone. Obviously there are many other mathematicians who are, around the same time started to put more effort. Because see, if the old stereotype of mathematician, you're so enclosed, you're not interested in even exposing the beauty of your subject to other people, you see? And then it becomes this vicious circle. But, you know, this one day, you know, I, not one day but all the time, I meet the students who say, \"Your book is the reason why I chose math as my major.\" And I am proud, especially when it's women who tell me this, and they are cool, they are DJs at the same time, and they are social and they have friends, and they go out and so on, you see? So they are, then they carry the torch because then they will be more likely to share this beauty with others, to attract more students and so on. So I think this kind of, this dominance was broken. So now they'll have more influx. And once we have people who are more able to connect at the personal level,",

Ask him about the Russian concepts of friendship, science, gender and love versus the American. You can, so there is a deep romanticism that you have that runs through your book \"Love and Math.\" Is part of that something you've picked up from the Russian culture? What can you speak to that fueled both your fascination with math and your fascination, no, your prioritization of the human experience of love? - Hmm. Good question. Definitely there is some influence of the Russian culture, Russian literature perhaps, you know. But also, you know, like there are so many things. How do we develop certain sensibilities, like why do we care about this and not that? Like why do I care, for instance, about, like you said, about this romantic idea, so to speak, of mathematics? That's certainly not something that is automatic, you know. Some people care about it, some people don't. And I'm not saying it is superior or inferior, it's just how my composition, my psychological composition is like that. And it's an interesting question, like what is the cause of it? So I think that we cannot really know, but there are some aspects of it, of course, the experiences, life experiences, our upbringing, family. Like I was, you know, I was surrounded by love by my parents on the one hand. But on the other side, perhaps they were a little overprotective of me. So I was kind of like, you know, too much kind of like taken care of. So then when I developed certain sensitivity, but was kind of not ready for the challenges - Of the real world? - of the real world. So then that struggle and then being lost, and then being able to overcome and to learn. And then if you do, if you don't lose, you don't appreciate maybe.

Growing up, you know, in the Soviet Union, that was not a walk in the park, you know. There were a lot of issues there that I had to go through. And then if it doesn't break you, make you stronger. But in my case, what happened was that, you know, for some of it, it took me 30 years to really come to terms with it and to really understand what happened. It gave me this motivation to strive to become a mathematician, which maybe I wouldn't have otherwise. It charged me, supercharged me. I'm talking about, for instance, the experience with exam at Moscow University. - [Lex] Can you take me through that experience? - So this is 1984. We spoke about Orwell earlier. And I was applying to Moscow University mathematics department. It's called (speaks in foreign language) - Which is like, for people who don't know, like the place. - [Edward] Was the only place to study pure mathematics in Moscow, period. - But also considered to be one of the great places on Earth. - And it's like a huge building. This, you know, this monolith of a building of Moscow University. So because, as I said, you know, a year earlier, Evgeny Evgenievich converted me into math, capitalizing on my love for physics, quantum physics. And so we, I spent a whole year studying with him, and I was already kind of at the level of, you know, in some subjects, a level of like early graduate studies. So it seemed like it would be a breeze to get into Moscow University. But in fact, little did I know that there was a policy of antisemitism where students like me would be failed by special examiners, mostly during the oral exam with mathematics, but occasionally it would be written tests and stuff. Now my father is Jewish by blood. He was not religious. His family was not religious. My mom is Russian and, but I was, since my last name was my father's name,",

And so there was a, can you imagine there were special people who would screen applicants, who would put aside the files of the undesirables. They would be special examiners who were actually professors at this university who would be designated as those who would take the exam from those undesirables. It was, it's almost comical when you look back now. And also like the question is why. There was no reason other than just hatred of the other. That's how I see it. - It's just to give a little bit more color, so, because you mentioned nationality. It's a little quirk that perhaps gives an insight to the bigger system that the nationality listed on your birth certificate when you're Jewish is Jewish. And when you're non-Jewish, it's listed as Russian. - For me it was Russian. So first of all, in the inner part, everybody has a internal passport. And there you have first name, patronymic name, last name, date of birth. So this is four. And the fifth column is nationality. Which comes from the nationality of the parents and so on. In my case was written Russian because my mom was Russian, but it didn't save me 'cause that was my dad's last name. And so anyway, this was the toughest experience that I had up until that point. And there was these two people who came into the room where I was the only undesirable. All other kids were being questioned by other examiners, but they told me that we cannot question you. We are waiting for special examiners. So I was like, oh-oh, something is afoot. And so these two guys came and for four hours basically, and were asking me questions which were not in the program and so on. But I know I was a kid, I was 16-years-old. I tried to answer best I can, but it was a setup. It's been documented since then there are even lists of problems that were given to undesirables in those days. In my year, no Jewish applicants, as far as I know, Jewish by this metric, were accepted. So then I had to go to this, there was one school, technical school in Moscow,",

I was 21, I was barely 21, because I already did some research in the meantime. That's how motivated I was, you know? So, but the interesting aspect of it is that for the longest time afterwards, I was telling myself a story that nothing really happened. It wasn't so bad. Okay, so I was failed, but I knew that I was going to succeed. It was 30 years later that I finally got to meet that boy, that 16-year-old, that I neglected at this time. And I realized that he died, that it was a crushing blow. - [Lex] The innocence? - Not just the innocence because there was no way, it looked like there was no way I could become a mathematician. Because if I don't, if they don't accept me there, it's over. I didn't know that I could actually find this striving applied math program, and then eventually somebody would take me under his wing, and so on, and then could move to the United States. This was not in the realm of possibilities. So in other words, I could, there was nothing to look forward to. It was clear that it's over. I cannot do what I love. And so when I finally connected to that boy, oh my God, that was a totally different experience. All the pain and all the trauma came to the surface, and it was a kind of a tsunami. I didn't, I wasn't sure I would survive this, it was so hard. And what happened was, I was invited to give a talk about this in New York. It was kind of a spoken word event about science, but like personal experiences related to science. This was almost a year after my book came out.

It was translated into other languages even before the book was published. I was surprised by this because I didn't know yet, so the adult Edward was not yet in touch, but the book gave the outlet to the child. So, and that kind of started the process. So finally, almost a year later, I'm in New York at this event. And the night before I'm in my hotel room, and I was like, okay, what am I going to talk about tomorrow? And I take a piece of paper just to, you know, my usual like preparation, you know, for things.

I saw how difficult it was, how crushed he was, and it looked completely hopeless. And I felt like, what's the point of living now for me, now that I know how cruel this world is? Which I didn't realize before, because I prefer to wear this pink, you know, the rose-colored glasses. But then something happened, it's so strange. It's like you feel that inside of you there is this dead child. And it is incredibly sad. I mean, it's like, I can't even describe it.

Thank you for doing this.\" And it's almost like, you know, I felt like the image came to mind is like a fallen soldier. Like you leave a fallen soldier on the battlefield, a wounded soldier, and then you come back to take him with you. And I say, but look, look what we have done. Look at us now. It was not in vain. We are doing okay. And it's kind of almost just like holding, holding, holding that child and that sense of who I am, you know, and feeling it. So the next day I went to the microphone and I let him speak for the first time, about his experience in his own voice. It was incredible. People were crying and afterwards came up to me and started sharing stories and so on. Because it is a story, it's a universal story. It's archetypal story. It's the story of rejection and being treated unfairly. We all know it. And I think it's so important to realize that it's possible to revisit those moments.",

There's a tension. I've interacted with a few folks in my personal life and in general that have lived through this experience of unfairness and cruelty in the world as young people. And what wisdom do you draw from the action you took of not acknowledging that you were a victim to cruelty, but instead just working your ass off, working harder? And then this, the flip side of that is you eventually reconnecting with the cruelty that you experienced. Because if you did that early on. - I was not ready for it. It is a defense mechanism. I could cry, I could have, you know, there were kids who commit suicide after this experience. I could've committed suicide because it's too much.

It's not, obviously there is a component where professionals could be involved, a professional therapist and so on. In my case, it somehow happened miraculously. Well, I did have support, but not from professional therapist, but from like dear friends.

And that is something which cannot be conceptualized, like that experience. Like it cannot give it to somebody. One thing I will say is that I felt that what it was, it was actually love, totally exposed, like naked, and you try to throw, it is so acute. So facing that love is incredibly painful because it's so intense. When the person is alive, we have, conversation, we have words, we have some actions, some stuff is going on, and it puts a filter. So you, we rarely actually feel love in this totally, completely pure unadulterated state. But when person dies, it's there and it's staring at you. And no matter what you do, you cannot turn away. Like I tried to, it's like almost I felt like I wanna throw a blanket over it. It burns, like immediately, like boom, gone. It's there. Live through it. And I was, I kept saying to myself, \"Just live through it, live through it.\" And that's how you know, also learn what is love, for example. What is it really? What is love? What is life also? Because I was completely, I had no idea. And then you kind of learn that, okay, so maybe it's not quite, there is more to eat, there is more to eat, there's more to this experience than what can be put in a concept or in a sentence. Maybe poetry or music can do some justice to it. But if so, then my own life has that component, has that dimension, which is beyond anything I can say about it, you know? And even though I love this, being this, playing this role, I love it. And I kind of, it kind of makes me feel different about all kinds of difficulties that arise because it's almost like I want to enjoy it because that's what being human is.

So thank you for letting me play. - It's gratitude for every single moment, even if it's dark, even if it's the loss of your father, everything. - Yes. And that's why I'm so, people around me, they all say that it's total doom and gloom and the world is ending. And I'm like, first of all, that's how you see it, okay. That's not the only point of view. But also, even if it is, like that's your challenge. Like what are you going to do about it? Stop complaining about other people. Do something yourself. How can you make it a better world, you know? - And I think all of that starts with just a gratitude for the moment, to be able to play this game. - Yeah. How beautiful it is. - What, we've talked about love, but let me ask, what role does love play in this whole game, in the human condition? - It's like the glue, you know. It's like, for me, it's like (laughs) And it's not, because people say love is like for a human being, like a romantic love. Which is a huge component of it, obviously, because it's so so beautiful to be able to, to express it in this way. But it could be love for what you do, for your passion for something, you know. Or love for your friends, for instance. Or love, it doesn't have to be. And so in some sense that's what it's all about. And ultimately because living without love, it's kind of bland and boring, and so. - And I don't think it's possible for science to explain exactly what it is. You can do a evolutionary biology perspective. You can talk about some kind of sociology perspective, psychology perspective, but the experience, the intensity where you forget, where time, we're reminded, becomes an illusion, and everything just freezes. - [Edward] Oh my god.",

        "text": "- And then it's kind of beautiful and painful to hear you say that, when you've experienced love, the deepest is when you lost it. - Yes, but in a sense you can say that you could not have one without the other. I could not have that deep connection with my father, like really on so, so many levels, if there weren't a moment, that's how I see it. And I'm not trying to say that's how everybody should see. For instance, I respect Ray Kurzweil. I respect and I feel and I almost like I get, I feel goosebumps right now. I feel that desire to reconnect, even if it is in a form of a, you know, a computer program. Let's be honest about it. I find it to be very moving. I find it very moving. And I understand because he actually didn't have a chance to spend much time, you know, I think he was 16 or 17 when he's, he was a teenager when his dad died. I was lucky 'cause my father died, I was much older. I've had so many moments with him. But that's not my thing. Like I think it is the feature, it's not a bug. And it sounds crazy. Like I would love, I would give anything to have him here right now. Right now, I, everything I have, I give it away right now. Where do I sign? Just to see him for one hour. I promise you I will. But I also know that I then, I'll still lose him or I will die or whatever, you know. So that thing, so what is, why is it so worse to just holding onto it? Why, why are we holding onto this? And I am the first sucker, I'm not the first one to hold on. But I'm questioning it now. I'm like, is there another way to approach life where you just, you know, how Buddha is like, just let it go. Enjoy and let it go. Enjoy and let it go. Is it possible? - Except the paradox of it. - Well ask me in a couple of years, you know. I will report. But I think that it, but to my mathematical mind, it sounds like a very interesting idea to be honest.",

        "text": "Because to me the idea of holding sounds like an impasse, because no matter, in all my experience, and if you look in history, every time somebody's holding, you know, is how they say it in \"The Matrix\", \"Whatever has a beginning has an end.\" It's like you cannot go around it. If you have a beginning, you will have an end. So then might as well just enjoy it and not worry too much about extending it longer. That's how I see it now. But maybe tomorrow will be something else, you know? - Yeah, the rollercoaster of life, the paradox of life. - Right. - Edward, you're an incredible human being. I've been a fan for a long time. Thank you for writing \"Love and Math.\" Thank you for being who you are, being both one of the greatest living mathematicians and still childlike wonder of the, exploring how this whole world works, the nature of the universe. And thank you so much for speaking with me today. This is amazing. - Been a pleasure, thank you. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Edward Frenkel. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Sophia Kovalevskaya, a Russian mathematician. \"It is impossible to be a mathematician without being a poet in the soul.\" Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.",
