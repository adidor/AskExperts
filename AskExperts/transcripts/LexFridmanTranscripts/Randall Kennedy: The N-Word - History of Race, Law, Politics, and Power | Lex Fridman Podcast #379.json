They invite a White person on stage. The White person is doesn't really sort of mystified, but it comes on stage and full out with what the rapper says, including the infamous N word. And then the Black rapper gets mad. Imagine the White comedian who satirizes that pokes fun at that, and in poking fun at that says the infamous N word. Am I angry? No, I'm not angry. Not angry at all. - The following is a conversation with Randall Kennedy, professor at Harvard Law School, and author of many seminal books on race, law, history, culture, and politics, including specifically on affirmative action, criminal justice, policing and the topic explored extensively in this conversation, the single most powerful word and slur in the English language, the N word, with a hard R at the end. Randall has written a book with this word as the title \"N word: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word.\" Please be warned that Randall uses this word throughout this conversation deliberately and skillfully to discuss its power and its role in the history of the United States. I don't intend to shy away from controversial topics like these, and I'll work hard to handle them thoughtfully and thoroughly with respect and with empathy, often with several guests who have very different perspectives on the topic. In the end, I believe in the power of long form conversations, the heal divides, by furthering understanding of human nature, of human history, and the full diversity of the human experience. This is Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Randall Kennedy. You wrote a book whose title is the \"N-word,\" spelled out with a hard R at the end. So let's start with the history of this word.",

        "text": "What is the history of the N word? - The word you're referring to is nigger. The book that you're referring to is \"Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word.\" The word dates back to the 16th, 17th century. It's got a long lineage in other words. Basically Latin, basically Spanish, basically NIG, Black in various formulations. We don't know actually how the term became a slur. So there were words that were close to N-I-G-G-E-R that were used in various ways. For instance, N-I-G-G-U-H was used, N-I-G-G-U-R was used, and sometimes it was used in a way that seemed to be just purely descriptive. We do know that by the early 19th century, it had become a slur, it had become a derogatory word about which people complained, but exactly how that came about, not altogether clear. - So it's been 20 years since you've written the book. What wisdom have you gained about this word since writing the book and maybe having to interact with people, having to read, having to see, having to feel the response to the book? - This book has generated a lot of controversy. I thought it would, it's probably generated more controversy than I had anticipated. It has certainly generated more different sorts of experiences than I had anticipated. So, for instance, I did not think that writing this book would prompt people to ask me to be an expert witness in cases. And over the past 20 years, I've been an expert witness in a number of different cases. I've been an expert witness in case in a murder case, in various cases of assault, I've been an expert witness in cases involving tort cases, intentional infliction of emotional distress. I've been an expert witness in a number of employment cases. I had not anticipated that, nor had I anticipated the extent to which people would get in trouble for using my book. Every year there are teachers who are suspended or who are fired because they will excerpt a chapter of my book. Let's imagine and this is not, I'm not imagining things this has happened,",

        "text": "that's a teacher is teaching, for instance, the Mark Twain's, \"Huckleberry Finn\" the word nigger appears in that book over 200 times. The teacher trying to be earnest, trying to be sensible, trying to be serious, will excerpt a part of my book to acquaint students with the history of the word and maybe the history of controversy involving the use of the word in this particular novel, the teacher will give it out, hand it out to the teachers, hand it out to students, and there have been a number of teachers who've been suspended or worse because of that, students will get upset, go home, tell their parents, their parents will storm to the school and say that this is terrible. The teacher is using the word nigger in an offensive way. And oftentimes, administrators will basically abandon the teacher. And whenever this comes to my attention, I'll write the superintendent of schools, or I'll write the principal, or sometimes I'll write an opinion editorial piece for the local newspaper. But every year there are teachers who are disciplined for using my book. I had not anticipated that. - And what is the nature of the letter or the op-ed that you write on why they shouldn't be disciplined or if they to the degree they should be or shouldn't be? - There has not been one case. There's not been one case that has come to my attention in which it was even remotely sensible for the teacher to be disciplined. And what I say is that, number one, frankly, I go through, what I write is almost a synopsis of my book. Number one, this is an important word in American history. It is a word that is explosive. That's why people get so upset. It's a word that's volatile. It's a word that has typically been used in a terrible way. It's a word that is part of the soundtrack of racial terrorism in the United States. So people ought to know about this word. I mean, if you're interested in knowing the real history of the United States, if you're interested in knowing about lynching, if you're interested in knowing about the way in which Black people have been terrorized in the United States, you need to know this word. You need to know that history. So you need to know why it is that people",

They read, they understand that. But then, but then what? But then they turn on their radios and they turn on, they listen to Spotify, they listen to some of their favorite entertainers. They listen to Dr. Dre, they listen to the Ghetto Boys, they listen to Snoop, and they listen to NWA. What do they hear? They listen to standup comedians. They listen to Dave Chappelle, they listen to Kat Williams. What do they hear? They hear the word nigger or nigga being used in a lot of different ways. And so they need to know about that as well. What are people doing? How does one explain the fact that Dick Gregory, Dick Gregory was a comedian, activist friend of Martin Luther King Jr. A true activist. I mean, he had a flourishing career as an entertainer that he abandons in order to struggle for racial justice throughout the United States and including the Deep South. How does one explain the fact that he wrote several memoirs, but his first memoir is called \"Nigger.\" A Memoir. How does one explain that? How does one explain Richard Pryor? I mean, Richard Pryor's best album is \"That Nigger Crazy.\" Well, was Richard Pryor trying to put down Black people? How does one explain that? One can only explain that by getting deeper into the word, by understanding that, yes, this is a word that has been used in a derogatory way. This is a word that has been used to put people down. This is a word that has been used to terrorize people. You gotta know that. But you also have to know that this is a word that has also been put to other uses. There are artists, there are entertainers who have used this word, like Dick Gregory used it to put up a mirror to American society and say, look at this word,",

Now, we want you to look at that, and we want to talk about that. James Baldwin. There was a documentary about James Baldwin a couple of years ago, highly lauded documentary. The title that was given in this documentary was, \"I Am Not Your Negro.\" That's not what James Baldwin said. Anybody can talk, go to YouTube right now. Take a look. James Baldwin said, \"I am not your nigger\". And then he went on to talk about that. Well, you know, James Baldwin wasn't, again, he wasn't starting to cover up anything. He wanted people to face the facts of American life. And it seems to me that if you're a teacher and you want to have your students face the facts about American life, well, you've got to grapple with the word nigger. Now, lemme just quickly say, teachers have a tough job. And if we're talking about students, of course there's a wide range of students. Am I saying that one ought to give my book to kindergartners? No, kindergartners are probably not ready for such a book. Third graders probably, no, not third grade. If we're talking, however, about people in the 10th grade, do I think the 10th graders can read my book? Yeah, sure absolutely. 11th graders, 12th graders, people in college. There are people in college, there are people in college, there are people in law schools. Teachers in law schools have been disciplined, because the word nigger has come out of a teacher's mouth. Why? A couple of cases recently, teacher would be reading a court opinion. The word appears in the court opinion. The teacher pronounces the word. Ah students get up, leave in a huff report, the teacher. There's some instances in which teachers have been under those circumstances have been disciplined. In my view, that's bad. And people ought to say it's bad, it's bad pedagogically. And frankly, in many of these instances, it's not only bad, it's stupid. And I don't mind saying that. I think that some of these instances",

It'd be one thing if a teacher looked at a student and called the student nigger. Get outta here nigger. That'd be, you know, fine discipline that's teacher. That's bad. But that's not what's going on. None of these are cases in which you have an individual who is a stranger to another individual. And this word just sort of comes out. No. What we have here is a class involving a person who is a teacher, interacting with students, talking about subjects in which it would be perfectly understandable why this word would emerge as a subject of conversation. Now, under those circumstances, it's somehow wrong for a teacher to utter this word. In my view, the answer is no. And you know, I said that 20 years ago. I say it even more emphatically now. - Still, it is one of the most powerful words in the English language. And there's a kind of responsibility that we as humans should have with words. With statements. That word, if not used skillfully, if not used competently, even when just read from a legal transcript, can do more harm than good. - I agree with what you say, yes, words are powerful. Words do matter. And so, I am certainly not suggesting that people be lax, I'm not suggesting that people be irresponsible. It's precisely because words matter, however, that we need to be willing to face words and grapple with words, and talk about words, and talk about the history of words precisely because words matter. And among other things, it seems to me it's important to understand that words can mean different things in different contexts. It's not the case that a word means the same thing in every context. The word discriminating, sometimes it's a very bad thing that person discriminates. And again, intonation of voice means something. If I say that person discriminates, and I'm obviously being disapproving,",

        "text": "implicitly what I'm saying is that person distinguishes between things on an unjustifiable basis, and that's a bad thing. On the other hand, that person has discriminating taste. Oh, that means something very different. That means that the person differentiates in a way that shows that they understand the difference between excellent, good, and not so good. And we think that that's a good thing. So words can have different words can mean different things in different contexts. It seems to me that that's something that actually we ought to recognized. We ought to recognize and talk about. - Well, some words enter this territory of being a slur. And it seems like when they cross the line into being a slur, there's the number of contexts in which it's okay to mention it exponentially decreases, right? - No, I'm gonna resist that a little bit. Because the whole idea of slurs, slurs change. Yankee was a slur. Yankee was a slur in 18th century United States. Slur today New York Yankees. I'm a Yankee fan, I'm a Yankee. Queer, and this is in my lifetime. There was a time, that you queer and people would really run away from it. And that was a bad thing. And then, thank goodness, gay Liberation Movement. Gay liberation Movement, basically, we're not gonna run away from this. We're gonna grab this quote slur, and we're going to affix it to ourselves, and we are going to repurpose it. Now, the word queer is again, can it be a slur? Yeah, it can be a slur. Doesn't have to be. And it seems to me that it's important for people to know about how a word, a symbol in some context, can be a slur in some context doesn't have to be. So the whole idea of what's a slur, that's a complicated idea in and of itself. - That's very complicated. If I may say almost fascinating how language evolves, but if we were to kind of have a minute by minute evaluation of the most powerful intensely slur like words in the world, I think the N word with a hard R at the end, which is the title of your book, is number one on that list. - Well, I probably, so, and of course, one of the reasons",

You mentioned queer, it's maybe was in the top 20, I don't know, for a while. And now it's sliding into the top thousand. And the N word is at the top. - You're absolutely right. The origins of this book, I clearly remember I was at my office and I was thinking about lecture topics, and I get invited to give lectures from time to time. And I was thinking, well, what might make for an interesting lecturer? And all of a sudden the word popped into my mind. Now, this is a word I've grown up with this word. I mean, there's never been a time in my life when at least in my conscious life, in which this word's been absent. I mean, in my household, for instance, in my household, my parents are Black people. My parents were refugees from the Jim Crow South. I was born in the deep South, South Carolina. In my household, I heard the word nigger used in every possible way. I heard it used as a slur. I also heard it used with respect to people who were praised. My father, I clearly remember my father, whom I revere. That's the smartest nigger in the world. That's the bravest nigger in the world. That's the baddest nigger I know. He wasn't putting people down. This is the way he talked. And I grew up hearing this word in various ways. And so I was thinking to myself, God, where did this word come from? And one of the first things I did, I clearly remember just jumping up outta my seat, running up to the library, Oxford English dictionary. When did this word first appear in English? Was the history of the word? And then what really sort of grabbed my attention is I get my computer going, and I asked the computer system give me every case, every federal court case in which this word appears, thousands of cases. And then I said, \"Oh my goodness, and then this is really interesting.\" And then I started just cataloging all the different cases.",

So for instance kike, K-I-K-E, longtime, derogatory word for Jews. How many times has this word come up? There was a time in which the word appeared, but nothing like the infamous N word, nothing and then I what about wet back? What about, and then I just let me just take a look at all the other slurs. Nothing came close, not even remotely close to nigger. And I think it has something to do with the uniqueness of the color line, particularly as it pertains to African-Americans. I think that the fact that nigger sort of occupies such a unique status among slurs, I think that's a reflection of the unique stigma that has been imposed on African-Americans. - It's hard to know the chicken or the egg, why one word is able to so distinctly and clearly encapsulate this struggle between races that is throughout American history. I mean, they didn't have to probably be so, but it came that to be that way. - It became that, not only that, not only that, but of course the nigger spurred other slurs. So Arabs, sand niggers, the Irish, the niggers of Europe, women, the niggers of the world. - John Lennon even has a song. - That's right. Well, I think Yoko Ono, I think had something to do with that song. So, I mean, it is a slur that has spawned other slurs. And again, that's why as you indicated a moment ago, this is a quite unique term. - But are you conscious? Are you deliberate in you saying this word? So let me just say from a personal experience, maybe my upbringing, where I came from in my daily life, I don't think I've ever heard that word with a hard R said as often. You clearly in my life said I've heard it today more than I have ever heard in my entire life. And I think there's a few people who listen to this that will be listening to this.

But are you deliberate in that action? And by the way, not only are the people listening to this sweating, this will be on YouTube in part. And YouTube the people on the other side will be sweating. What do we do with this? - Yeah, well, am I deliberate? The answer is yes. And let me unpack that a little bit. First, that's right. I mean, am I deliberate? Yeah. I deliberately wrote a book called \"Nigger:The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word.\" And was that deliberate? Yeah, that was quite deliberate. - But the title could have been N word versus- - The title could have been N word, sure. The title could have been in the title could have been a book about a word that causes pain to many people. I could have named it that, there are many titles I could have used. Did I want a title that would be provocative? Did I want a title that would grab people? The answer to that is yes. I'm a writer. I want people to read what I write. Was I being sensationalistic? Well, I mean, if you want to put it like that, yes. I'm not embarrassed to say that. I mean, I'm sure that when people write books, they think really hard about their titles, and they try to get a title that will grab people's attention. I know people respect people very deeply, who never, as a matter of principle, never utter this word. And I've talked with people, I've had people say, \"I read your book, let's talk about it. But let's be very clear. I'm not gonna use the word.\" I've had many conversations with people who've asked me not to use the word. The first time this came up was a book tour. It was 20 years ago when the first book first came out. And I was on one of these call-in shows early in the morning. Time came to call in seven o'clock.

Am I gonna go on or am I not? - [Jack] What'd you do? - I went on and I abided by the station's rules. And fine, we had a perfectly fine conversation. And there is a place for euphemism. The American language is a very supple language. There are lots of words that one can use. I do not get angry with people who don't, they say, as a matter of principle, they're not gonna use the word fine. I understand where they're coming from, and often I will defer to their wishes. All I say is I want people to understand where I'm coming from. I'm not just using this word willy-nilly. There's a pedagogical reason. There is a reason for why I'm saying what I'm saying. There is a reason why I use the word. - Can you make the case why using the word is a good idea? And can you steel man the case why it's a bad idea? Maybe you've heard from some critics. Who said that you saying this word out loud is actually causing a lot of harm. Not like harm because people's feelings are hurt, but increasing the amount of racism and hate in the world. - Yeah, critics, let's start with the critics. One, again, going back to when the book was first published, I remember going to the first bookstore I went to, and I talked about the book, had a very talked, asked questions. And the last comment wasn't a question, but the last comment was made by an elderly Black man. I called on him and he said, \"I've listened to what you've had to say, and I appreciate what you've had to say.\" But he said, \"But I remain unconvinced and I remain unconvinced, because when I was coming up, this word was used to put me in the back of the bus.

And I thought that there was a lot of power behind that gentleman's comment. I think that what he said is probably correct and so far as there are probably some people who read the book. There are probably some people who are listening to our conversation right now who will think that I'm giving people permission to use the word. I have said that I'm not, I want people to understand the word. I think that there is a burden that comes from whenever you utter a word like this. But that's a critique.

And by the way, I should say, and that's why I would say to anyone that's right. If this word comes out of your mouth, you are taking on real responsibility. So for years, it doesn't happen so much now, but I'd say for about the first five years after this book was published, I would get an email at least once a week, and it would begin like this, \"Dear Professor Kennedy, I read your book and I'm calling to ask you a question.\" And as soon as I saw that I knew what the question was gonna be, and then would what the person would say is the following, I like rap. And I knew what was coming. \"I like rap. I'm White and I have Black friends, and we listen to rap and we're driving in the car and we're listening to the song. We we start humming along and singing along, and my Black friends sing along. And when nigga or nigger comes up, they sing, and I don't know what to do.",

So I wrote a form letter, and basically what I said was, listen, number one, I'm flattered that you're asking me, but number one you should have a conversation with your friend. Number two, no matter what your friend says, let me put something else for you to consider. Let's suppose for the sake of discussion that your friend says, \"Oh, doesn't bother me. I know where you're coming from. We're just enjoying the music.\" I don't think that this is a racist utterance, coming outta your mouth. Let's suppose that your friend says that, that doesn't end matters. Because let's imagine the following. Let's imagine that you are in a theater and you're waiting for the film to start, and you're just talking with your friends or singing with your friends, or just kicking back with your friends and they're talking about nigga this or nigger this, and you say it, you the White boy say it. And the next thing you feel is a fist, a big fist in your mouth that has been launched by a person that you did not see who was right behind you. All this person saw was a White person saying nigger, and the next thing pow. That's not some sort of overheated scenario coming from some law professor's mind. That is a very plausible scenario. So you have to be worried about lots of things, including mistake. So my advice to you is be prudent. I would stay clear the word unless, unless you're very certain and unless if you're called on it, you feel you're in a position to defend yourself, defend what you're doing. But the prudent thing would be to stay clear. - There's so many questions I wanna ask there. One is about the violence and the legal aspect of that.

These are all different versions. And I feel like in that list of powerful words, I feel like there's a distinction. I feel that the number one spot is the one with the hard R. And I don't know, maybe you can try to shed light, but I feel like the one that ends in GA is really far down the list in terms of modern culture. So this is, we talked about the evolution of the words and the word queer, for example. It feels like because maybe because of rap, because of comedians, because of it's become much more, it lost so much of its power. Oh, you don't think so? - No, I think there's a difference between nigga and nigger. I mean, people make a distinction between them. And I think that to the extent that lots of people make a distinction between them, I think just as a sociological fact, they are different. I think that people who get upset, if somebody, especially White people, so if a White person says nigger and they're sort of criticized about it, and they say, \"Well, I didn't say nigga, I said, nigger, believe me, I think most people, most people who are mad at them are gonna stay mad at them. Now you raised the word, so and, I would put in a very different category than negro. - [Jack] Educate me here. - Well, yeah, sure, I'm happy to. Negro is a also controversial, it's also controversial. But negro has never been viewed by a substantial number of people as a derogatory term, at least with the same amount of animus, the same amount of, it's a very different kind of word than nigga or nigger. I mean, after all, I mean, negro, Martin Luther King Jr. All of his great oratory negro. You read the work of the great W.E.B Dubois, \"Negro.\" You read the work of my boss. For for instance, I use the word negro. I use African-American, Black Afro-American, but I also use the word negro. Now, there are some people who get really mad at me because when I use the word negro and so for instance, there's students who've gotten really quite exercised, and they'll say, I'll be giving a lecture, and I a hand will go up, I'll call on somebody",

Or are you using it in your own voice? And often I'll say, \"Well, I'm using it in my own voice.\" And I'll say, \"Well, I'm offended.\" We think that this is that's old timey. It's derogatory. When this first came up, I said, \"Let's pause for a moment and I'll take that under advisement and let me look into this.\" And I ended up writing an essay about it, an essay about the history of the terms that Black people have used to describe themselves. And it's a long list, Black, colored, Afro-American, African-American, Negro, et cetera. So I go through all that and I said, now let me just tell you, I know for certain, when I started using the word negro, often in writing, I can date it. 1983, the summer of 1983 is when I started using the word negro in my professional life as a lawyer. And I did it for a very specific reason. I did it because my boss demanded that I negro capital in. Now who was my boss? My boss in the summer of 1983, was Associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, Thurgood Marshall, known as Mr. Civil Rights. Now it seems to me, you are telling me that this word is so out of bounds, that this word is derogatory. Nobody should ever use this word. Does the fact that Thurgood Marshall demanded that I use this word, does that complicate things a little bit? And so I think that people, again, ought to know more. I mean, I've encountered students who don't know very much, but who want to lecture me on word usage because they know three sentences about current fashion and hold it, hold it by the way, I push it further. I sometimes use the word colored and then some people really don't like that. Colored, well, there's an organization still very much alive in American life and law, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the NAACP, they haven't changed their name. And as far as I'm concerned, it's a wonderful organization.",

So again, there are lots of different words that one can use. You can use different formulations. I understand that people have different preferences. Fine, I have my preferences at least know where I'm coming from. - Still words have power and they have power to hurt. And there's a lot of reasons that I could see to justify the use of the word in its full form as you're saying, when in this conversation is you're using it, one of them is perhaps fighting for the freedom to be able to use those kinds of words. So let me ask you about the freedom of speech and the censorship of the word. Should they use the van word be censored, for example, on social networks? So we can come up with different places. We can say university campuses, maybe in op-eds or I don't know, but I think social networks currently is a very interesting place. There's a lot of conversations that are happening on them. There's the ability, the technical capability to sentence, to remove the ability of people to use the word. Do you think they should be allowed to use the word on Twitter, for example? - My response is, it all depends on the way in which the word is being used. If the word is being used to intimidate, if the word is being used to terrorize, then no, along with lots of other words, by the way, I mean, I could use the word I suppose, gentlemen. I mean, I'm sure that I could conjure up a way in which that word could be used in intimidating way. So would I be happy if there was a technology that always blanked this word, N-I-G-G-E-R. I would be against that. For one thing, it would erase the name of one of my books. And I think that the book actually has a lot of useful information and make some useful points. And by the way, let's imagine a world in which there was a technology that blanked every time N-I-G-G-E-R appeared. What would that do to novels by James Baldwin, by Tony Morrison.

If one sort of plays that out, would one want to have all of those blanks in important literary and political performances? No, I don't want such blanks. What I want, I would want the word to be there and for people to understand how to deal with this word. And by the way, you've used the word hurt and awful lot. So let's talk about hurt. I think we need to be more careful with the way in which we deal with hurt. Because people can be justifiably hurt. You can have justifiably hurt feelings. And if somebody has justifiably hurt feelings, I then think that we should turn to the person who has hurt those feelings and say, \"You have acted wrongly because this person's feelings are justifiably hurt in relationship to what you've done.\" On the other hand, there are people who have hurt feelings, and frankly, it's unjustified. So just imagine the following. Let's imagine that I give a talk about the greatness of Martin Luther King Jr. And then let's imagine that a Ku Klux Klansman comes up to me after my talk and says, \"Oh, you have now hurt my feelings.\" What am I supposed to apologize? Am I supposed to be regretful that my talk about the greatness of Martin Luther King Jr. Has hurt the feelings of the Klansmen? No, my response is gonna be, you need to reevaluate your feelings because actually your feeling of hurt is unjustified. And no, there's no apology coming from me. - But there, there's a kind of line, and perhaps the gray area, and maybe the word hurt has been overused. 'Cause if you try to avoid hurting a small fraction of society that is mentally weak in a way where everything hurts them, that's the wrong way to build a society. But if we flip that upside down and say, trying to maximize the amount of love in the world, and think about decisions we make in terms of the language you use to try to maximize the amount of love, and not just short term, but long term.

And I would associate myself with your vision. How can we maximize love? No, I love that. I think that's great. So let's take that on. I doubt that the way of doing that is to erase the infamous N word. I doubt that the way of doing that is to say to people, we understand that your feelings are really hurt, and we're gonna do all that we can to avoid this symbolic action. Maybe this word or maybe this symbol. We're gonna do all that we can to suppress it so that we can have a more loving universe. I doubt that that's the way to do it. I think a better way to do it, I think a better way to do it would be to fully educate people, including educate people such that you see that over there, that is the uniform of the Ku Klux Klan.

In fact, it seems to me that the, the bulldozeration of these great artists, literary work is, as far as I'm concerned, highly objectionable. Highly objectionable. - When is it okay for a White man to say the N word with a hard R? - Well, here we need to focus on the word say. Is it ever okay for anyone, Black, White, pink, yellow, I don't care, red, orange. Is it okay for anyone to use this word in a way to put down people, to terrorize people, to intimidate people? Answer no. And I'd say that Black person I've seen, I mean, by the way I've seen Black people use this word to try to intimidate, put down other Black people, bad. So I'm against it with a Black person, White person doesn't matter. On the other hand, imagine a White person who is giving a lecture on the history of American racism, a lecture on the history of American racism. And in giving that lecture quotes, the White racist politicians who until fairly recently in American life, used the infamous N word. So imagine a White history professor giving a lecture about the history of American racism, and says, \"In 1948, this is what so and so running for the presidency of the United States said.\" And then quotes a paragraph or two in which the infamous N word is featured. Is that bad? No, that's not bad. No, that's not bad. It sounds like a perfectly good lecture, and I'm glad that you put the infamous N word in there so that we can see that as recently as 1948 people who were running for the presidency of the United States openly use the word that does not bother me.

They invite a White person on stage. The White person is doesn't really sort of mystified, but it comes on stage and full out with what the rapper says, including the infamous N word. And then the Black rapper gets mad. Imagine the White comedian who satirizes that, pokes fun at that. And in poking fun at that says the infamous N word. Am I angry? No, I'm not angry. Not angry at all. - What if in the process of satirizing that comedian's not very funny? - You say that bad joke, you were not funny. I don't object to the use of the infamous N word. I just say, \"You're not very funny.\" - But because there's a line when the joke is not funny, it just seems like the comedy is used as a cover to actually say something hateful. It's an interesting thing about comedy. I feel like the funnier you are, the more you can get away with. And that's something to do with the thing we said earlier, which is when you use words that have power, you should do so with skill and competence and the responsibility those words carry. - Again, the cases that I'm most familiar with are the cases involving teachers, professors, academic. And it is said sometimes, \"Oh, why do I object?\" I object. Sometimes people say, because I suspect that this teacher just wanted to say the word and that all of this is a cover, a pretext. In my sense of it is, no, I don't think it's a pretext. If it's pretextual, that's bad. But in my experience, I have not seen that.

Now, the first thing I wanna say about this is that this campaign, these laws, these various policies telling teachers, don't teach this and don't teach that. And you can't use this book, you can't use that book. This is a frightening encroachment on freedom, freedom of speech, freedom to learn, freedom to listen, freedom to read. That's terrible. And it's one of the most frightening things that has happened in American life in recent memory. So that's the first thing I wanna say about so-called critical race theory. Now, now I'll say something, I'm gonna take the quotation marks off of the term critical race theory. Critical race theory is a sort of you could have a nice conversation about actually what it is. One way of viewing it is to say that, well, critical race theory is a community of ideas that comes from a community of people. The community of people would be people in legal academia. In the period starting and probably the middle of the 1980s, it would be associated with people like Derek Bell. It would be associated with people like Kimberly Crenshaw, people like Charles Lawrence, people like Richard Delgado, people like Mary Matsuda. And these are folks who held, they articulated a couple of propositions. One of their propositions was that liberal race policy was insufficient. They would say that the racial policies of a person like my old boss, their good Marshall, the liberal racial policies were insufficient to grapple fully with the pervasiveness and the depth and intensity of American racism. Their basic claim. And I think by the way, it was a good claim. Their basic claim was that American racism is more central,",

And I think there was a lot of strength to that proposition, but then they also took on some other propositions with which I was in very strong disagreement. So I think it's perfectly fine to say that racism is a force in American life that is deeper, more pervasive, more stubborn, more resilient than I think people often, often understand, often perceive. But then some of the folks, in critical race theory push further. One of the propositions that some of the people in critical race theory took was the proposition that America was doomed to always be a country that would be governed according to the dictates of White supremacy. Derek Bell, who was a colleague of mine, and a friend of mine, took that position. He talked about the permanence of racism in American life, and he took the position that the various changes that had been wrought in American life were really, mainly cosmetic. They didn't amount a whole, a whole lot. I mean, Derrick Bell took the position, the second reconstruction, the civil rights movement. Well, yeah, it made changes, but at the end of the day, Black people were still, a after the second reconstruction, were still in a position of almost, I don't know. Some of them would even say Neo-slavery. Well, I think that's ridiculous. The second reconstruction changed a lot. And as for Neo-slavery, Neo-slavery, what are you talking about? A Black American was president of the United States between the years 2008 and 2016. I mean, what are we talking about here? There's been a tremendous change, and I think people ought to understand that. Now, am I saying that everything is Peachy Keenan and all right? No, the United States is still, to a very large extent, still a pigment autocracy. But that doesn't mean that a lot hasn't changed a lot has. So I disagree with certain tenets of critical race theory and have been very outspoken in my disagreement. There's another one, by the way, I need to mention, because we've talked so much in our discussion about freedom of speech, freedom to teach, freedom of listening. Another big problem that I've had with some of the people",

Some of the people who associate themselves with critical race theory think that racist beliefs ought to be expunged with the aid of state power if need be. Well, I'm against that. And I think we are at a moment a an ironic moment in which actually it's the right wing that has embraced some of the ideas that were championed by Some of the people who call themselves critical race theorists, they say, \"Oh, we ought to expunge hate speech.\" Well, the right wing is saying this critical race theory that's hate speech, so let's expunge it. And so, again, I've been very outspoken in my criticism of some of the illiberal dimensions of critical race theory. So I've been a critic of certain features of critical race theory. I have applauded certain features of critical race theory, critical race theory, there's some aspects of it that I think have been useful. There's some aspects of it that I think have been profoundly wrong, edited. So that's where I am. And I certainly, and above all, I certainly am against any efforts to remove it from the intellectual universe. It is a part of our intellectual universe. People ought to know about it and people ought to debate it. And people ought to be free to make up their minds to conclude what they will about the strengths and weaknesses of critical race theory. - And we'll talk about the pessimistic and the optimistic perspective on race in history of the 20th century in America. I think you have very interesting perspectives there. But before that, I'd love to look at the current moment, and you had a conversation with Glenn Lowry and John McArther, and from there it became clear to me, I think John made clear how important to the conversation about race is policing in today's society.

So, to what degree do you think there's widespread institutional racism in policing? - Yeah. well, my first book, was a book called \"Race Crime and the Law.\" And- - [Jack] 1997. - 1997, wow. (laughs) - [Jack] Time flies. - Time flies. Unfortunately, unfortunately, the impetus behind that book stands, that book was propelled by a sense that with respect to the administration of criminal justice, African-Americans feel deeply aggrieved, and they feel deeply aggrieved with good reason. And they feel deeply aggrieved with good reason in at least two dimensions. On the one hand, on the one hand, African-Americans suffer from under protection. And in fact, in that book, the central theme of that book was that Black Americans suffer from under protection. If you take a look at the broad, the sort of the broad trajectory of American history, and ask yourself in what way have Black Americans been most oppressed? Well, take a look at the antebellum period, period before the abolition of slavery, before the abolition of slavery the locales where most Black people resided, namely the slave states. In a lot of those areas, question, was there a crime called the murder of a Black person? Answer, for a long period, the answer was no. There might have been a tort, so if a White person killed the slave, killed a slave, that person could be sued because they had injured the property of another and would have to pay money for that. But had they committed a crime? Answer no. In the antebellum period, were Black women protected against the crime of rape? In most states, the answer was no. There was no such crime. Let's go to after, slavery is abolished, thank God. Slavery is abolished. Then let's see what happens? So we hear lynching.",

It goes down, that was the case in the 1890s, probably the first decade of the 20th century. And then it starts going down. What was lynching about? Lynching was about Black people being executed outside the law. Did the legal system do anything about that? Answer no. You show me cases in which people were prosecuted criminally for engaging in lynching. You come up in most places with a null set, Black people suffered the under protection of the law. Do Black people still suffer the under protection of the law? The answer is yes. And people talk about the Kerner Commission report, 1968 Black people were asked, with respect to the police. What's your main complaint? In many places, the main complaint was, we don't have police protection. When things happen to us, when our houses are burgled, when our businesses are encroached upon by robbers, when our businesses are robbed, when we are assaulted, nothing happens. The police protect White people. They don't protect us. Under protection. Our society right now, if you take a look at the statistics, who is most liable to be raped, robbed, the victim of assault, what have you, Black people. I mean, and it's not even close. Under protection. So that's one way in which the administration of criminal justice harms Black people by not doing what government is supposed to do, which is protect us. 14th amendment, equal protection. I underline protection of the law. So that was a big theme of race crime in the law. Now, second thing, second, and this is a thing that gets most attention, and it's important, I think that the under protection story does not get enough attention. But then there's a second story. The second story is that Black people have, historically, and still today, Black people are subjects of invidious racial discrimination",

It can show itself in various ways. It can show itself in a look. It can show itself in who gets the look Black person's walking down the street or running down the street, White person's walking down the street or running down the street. What happens with respect to the police? Let's suppose that who gets the second look? Who is followed? Who is detained for a moment? - Well, some of it is just on a small tangent, I apologize to interrupt, but attitude is an interesting one because a lot of it, a lot of the interaction doesn't show up in the data. So, detained, for example, starts showing up in the data, but before then, the second look, the third look, the first look, this is where the gray area of conversation happens, because- - [Randal] Very much so. - Culture and society happens in the stuff that doesn't often show up in the data. - Yep. So I'll tell you. This really came home to me several years ago. I was in New York City, and it was at a time when there was a lot of discussion over the stop and frisk, stop and frisk, basically racial profiling on the street. I was in Harlem, I'm walking down the street, and frankly the police weren't bothering me. I'm just walking. No, no, the police weren't bothering me. But I'm of a certain age. I did notice though, I was looking at the police and the way that the police attitude, it had to do with body posture. It had to do with, that's right, who got a second look? I noticed, I'm walking down the street, I'm walking in Harlem there are White people in the street, most of the people though were Black, some Hispanic, the level of contempt, the level of animus, the level of unfriendliness that was pouring off, the cop, the police, they didn't say anything.

The consequence it was gonna have is, let's imagine that the police did say, \"Excuse me, what are you up to?\" Now, if you have been feeling this contempt? If you feel like the officer who is asking this question doesn't like you, doesn't know anything about you, but just doesn't like you on site, you might answer in a certain sort of way. You're not going to give the cop the benefit of the doubt and basically think, well, policeman's just asking me this, probably just trying to make the neighborhood safe. Well, if that's your feeling, policeman's just asking me this, trying to make the neighborhood safe. Well, officer, the reason why I'm here is such and such and thanks for your service. That's one response. Another response is, I'm not gonna tell you anything. I'm not gonna tell you anything. I know that you don't mean me any good. I'm not gonna tell you, tell you anything. Am I free to leave? And then the cop having heard that then says something back, after five minutes, what do you have? You have an altercation on your hand. And I felt that, and that is part, and you're absolutely right. That's not written down. It doesn't get to court. It's there. But it's an important part of street life. It's an informal part of street. - And it has ripple effects because that young Black man will probably talk shit about that cop later that day.

There were Black men who had been stopped many, many times. It wasn't just once over and over and over again, under circumstances in which they ought not have been stopped. And this has real consequences. It doesn't just show up here, though, of course, it also shows up in other places with respect to the administration of justice. And we still have a big problem.

Why is it that those sorts of things are forgotten about when some Conservatives? By the way, not all conservatives, not all conservatives, there's some conservatives who have stuck and appropriately so to their guns and have said, A, we need to make sure that the police stay in their lane.

So let's imagine that a Black person who's 25 years old is walking down the street right next to a White person who's 25 years old. Some people would say, you know what, under those circumstances, it's okay for the police officer to give two looks at the Black person and only one look at the White person, why? Because the statistics tell us that the Black 25 year old, there's much more risk of that person acting in an unlawful way. If you take a look at crime statistics and ask the question with respect to homicide, with respect to robbery, with respect to various crimes, is there a difference between the White 25 year old and the Black 25 year old? With respect to certain crimes, the answer is in certain places the answer is, yeah, there is a difference. And there is a greater risk that the Black 25 year old has engaged in various forms of criminality. Under those circumstances, what do I say? Should the police officer therefore be allowed to take action vis-a-vis the Black person as opposed as against the White person? My answer is no. I'm fully willing to concede, let's concede for the point for the point of discussion that there is more risk, there might be, there might be, but for reasons of constructing the sort of society I want, we should not empower agents of the state to act towards certain people in a way that's adverse to them.",

It was a while ago, but it wasn't all that long ago. And this very issue came up with the respect to the profiling of Muslims. And there were some people who said, well, geez, in the aftermath of 911, profiling of Muslims makes sense. No hard feelings, but you know, the 11 people who were on those planes, were all Muslims. Now, there is a rationale. You could just simply say, \"It's not prejudice, it's not animus, it's not invidious. It's just, the facts take us this way.\" Well, the facts never take us this way. There are facts, and then there is our choice of how we want to respond to those facts. Now, you could respond by saying, \"Well, we perceive Muslims to be more likely to do bad things on an airliner.\" You could respond in that way. On the other hand, you could say, \"No, we want a society in which people do not have to grapple with prejudice on the basis of their religion or on the basis of their race.\" And to deal with that, we are gonna demand, we're gonna demand that agents of the state acts towards people in the same way. And so if that means that everybody getting on the airplane before they get on the airplane has to open up their luggage and it slows things down, but everybody has to open up their luggage, I would prefer that over a system in which we focus on people who are Muslim. And one of the reasons, and I'm gonna bring this back to our, does the racial thing, one of the reasons why I wanna insist upon that is because if we all have to open up our luggage, what that means is we are all paying a tax for more security, and we're all likely to ask ourselves, do we want to pay this tax? Whereas if we focus simply on the Muslims and allow the Muslims to be the only ones who are sort of paying the tax, we'll foist that on them. Same in the Black person, White person, 25 years old, walking down the street. Do we want to impose a racial tax on the Black 25 year old? Some people would say yes.",

Why do you think there is racism in the world? - Oh, now, okay fine, you've asked me a question which I throw up my hands, and I don't know. - Will there always be, why is there tribalism? Are humans always finding this way to divide ourselves? And how bad of a problem is that? - It's a huge problem.

I mean, I live in a university, so I'm reading constantly and listening constantly. From what I gather, the problem of divided societies is a problem that is worldwide.

And now we're headed towards war. - The interesting thing is, if I were to step outside of this whole thing, from an alien perspective, visiting earth, I think America is one of the greatest, if not the greatest countries in the history of human civilization. And I think that the line between White and Black, the racial struggle is the thing that in part made it a great nation. There's something about the division and the way you alleviate that division through the struggle for human rights that makes for a great nation. And so it's interesting that the division is almost the fuel for the greatness for our discovery of what it means to be human, what it means to be or what justice means of. And it's interesting that it seems like there's the struggle that you're elucidating now, but that struggle itself is our search, a man's search for meaning and justice and freedom. - I think there's something to that. As you were speaking, I was immediately thinking of the person who most jumped to mind was the great, Frederick Douglass. So, I mean, here you have a person who, in my view, is one of the great people in the history of the world. And one of the things that ironically enabled him to become one of the great people of the world, he was born into slavery. His overcoming was the very thing that in a sense made him this larger than life figure. And I think there's something to you, I will say this because a minute ago you mentioned optimism and pessimism. And I'd say in the last few years, my feeling about the United States has changed. And it's changed in a somber way for most of my life, for most of my life, I've been in the optimistic camp with respect to my view of American race relations.",

I mean, it's the more interesting camp because in the pessimistic camp you have, I mean, if I was gonna list some of my pessimists, pessimist number one, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Jefferson, the author principal author, \"Declaration of Independence.\" He was also the author of \"Notes on the State of Virginia.\" And he said, in \"Notes on the State of Virginia,\" basically, we shall not overcome. He talked to, he said, \"The Black people will always know that their fore bears were enslaved, and they will always be resentful of that, always be aggrieved by that.\" Jefferson did not think that we would ever have in the United States a multiracial democracy. He was very critical of slavery. Now, he was a hypocrite. He had slaves, he sold slaves. He was terrible in that way. But he did understand that slavery was horrible, but he did not wanna free the slaves for a variety of reasons, but in one reason was because he thought that it would be impossible to have a society in which Blacks and Whites were equal neighbors. He was thoroughly pessimistic. Another pessimist, Alexis de Tocqueville, thoroughly pessimistic. So who were some of the other pessimists? Abraham Lincoln, pessimistic. That's why he was so interested in colonization. He basically said, I don't like slavery, but Blacks and Whites are not gonna be able to share the United States.

And he was always very interested, therefore, in colonization, even during the Civil War, he was interested in maybe all Black people, would all Black people be interested in maybe going to Panama? Would they be interested in going someplace else? Because Lincoln was aware of how racist White people were including himself, and he did not think that Black people and White people would be able to share the United States. Now, there's the Black nationalist tradition. You mentioned Malcolm X before Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey, my father was a thoroughgoing pessimist. His view was the United States was born as a White man's country. It's going to remain a White man's country. And that's the way it is. He was thoroughly pessimistic. - You mentioned, just a brief aside about your dad, that when you moved to South Carolina to Washington DC and you asked him why his response to you was because either a White man was going to kill me or I was going to kill a White man. So he saw race as an important line that divided people in the United States. - He certainly did. And he thought that the line, my father had passed away before Obama was elected.

No, it wasn't when dinosaurs roam. 1865, frankly is not all that long ago. In 1865, the great mass of Black people in the United States had recently been released from chattel slavery.

Well, since you mentioned the literacy from, what is it, 150 years ago, let me ask you about affirmative action. You wrote a book on the topic, Titled \"For Discrimination: Race, Affirmative, Action, and the Law.\" First, what is affirmative action? And maybe we could talk about what your view is it on it today. - Sure, well, affirmative action refers to racial affirmative action. 'Cause there's various sorts of affirmative action. I mean, you can have affirmative action for veterans. You can have affirmative action for in-state residents. Let's suppose you have a school, the university of blah, blah, blah. And we're gonna give a reach out a hand to boost help people who live within this state, or we're gonna have a boost for veterans. We're gonna have a boost for women. We're gonna have a boost for men in certain circumstances. Well, the type of affirmative action that gets most attention and that's worth noting as well. There's sorts of affirmative action. But when you say affirmative action, the type of affirmative action that immediately people are thinking about is racial affirmative. - Seems like race is at the core of this American experiment, though, part of, in every part of its culture. - Bingo. You know, why is it that there's various ways in which institutions reach out to help various sectors of our population. Why is it that this is the one that generates all of the pulling out of hair and gnashing of teeth? We can put that to the side for a moment. Racial affirmative action refers to efforts in which institutions, reach out to provide assistance to racial minorities.",

        "text": "Now, the reaching out can happen in different ways. A light form of affirmative action might be reaching out in terms of recruiting, making a special effort to make sure that young people, let's say in racial minority neighborhoods know about your college. That's recruitment. On the other hand, racial affirmative action might take a stronger form and might take the form of saying, okay, we have a competition and we think that there will be too few racial minority kids who do well enough in this competition to be admitted to our school. So what we're gonna do is we are going to, in various ways, give a boost to the minority kids. If it comes down to, you have two kids, they both I don't know, have 99 on the test, there's one place left. We only have one spot left, two kids, one's a Black kid, one's a White kid, they both got 99. We're gonna give it to the Black kid, why? Well Black kid, all there is to it, the Black kid. And maybe our theory is that Black people have been done wrong in the United States, and we want our institution to contribute to making amends. That might be a theory. Another theory might be we think that we'll have a more interesting student body, we'll have a better student body, a more better discussion if there are more Black kids on campus. And unless we make a special effort to bring more Black kids on campus, our student body will be overwhelmingly monoracial. We'll just have White kids, few Asian kids, a few Latino kids if there are no Black kids here, I don't know it'll be lacking an important aspect of American life. Some sort of the so-called diversity story. So any, there are various theories, some are grounded, like I said, in repairative justice. Some might be granted in distributive justice. So for instance, when people say nowadays, we want a cabinet, we want a team, we want a student body that looks like America. That might be a distributive justice theory for why you want affirmative action. Unless we reach out and give a boost to certain groups, they won't be here. And we want a campus that looks like America and we won't have a campus that looks like America",

Those are three justifications, all of which, however, are justifications for in a competition giving a special boost to some people based on their race. - So what's your sense? Can you make the case for affirmative action and can you make the case against it? - Yeah, I can make the case for and I can make the case against. The case for, I won't spend much time on this. Like I said, there are three main justifications. Your audience should know that one, the justification that actually led to affirmative action, is a justification that you don't hear about in the courts because the courts have said that, that justification is insufficient. So the real justification behind affirmative action was in the late 1960s, in the aftermath of the Civil Rights Revolution, in the aftermath of the civil rights movement, there was a feeling that, well, okay, fine, we're not discriminating against Black people anymore. But Black people have been disadvantaged by the discrimination that has been put upon them. And this discrimination that was put upon them has disabled them. And so they go into competitions and it's unfair. Yeah, they score less well on the standardized test. But surprise, surprise, what the heck? They went to schools in which they got the leavings of the White folks. The White folks gave the Black folks the old textbooks. That's what the Black kids read, the White kids read the newest textbooks, on and on and on. So reparative justice, we're gonna try to repair the scars left by past racial injustice and so it's sort of an effort to overcome the vestiges of past misdeeds.",

And frankly, I think that's the justification that has always been the predominant justification, whether people owned up to it or not. But that's one justification. The distributive justice justification is there, like I say, people, we want an integrated America. We want an America that looks like America. In that justification, legitimacy is sometimes mentioned. So for instance, people will say things like, well, if we're gonna, in the armed forces, you can't have an armed forces in which the sort of the people on the ground are, you have a lot of people on the ground who are people of color, but none of the people calling the shots. None of the generals, none of the colonels are people of color. No and that the people on the ground are not gonna stand for that. So for purpose of legitimation, for purposes of buy-in, we need to have a situation in which people get the sense that even if they're sort of low down, they're still part of the story. They're part of the team. So that's part of the sort of I don't know, distributive justice notion. - Do you think there's power to that? I mean, do you think there's value, there's correctness to that kind of idea? - I think there's some. - Because for the application process for different universities, I think that there's probably a driving narrative. The justification for well affirmative action. I don't know where we put DEI efforts because they overlap, but they're not perfectly overlapping. - The reason that the school, so yeah, as you know, there is a case will know about it. It'll be announced sometime in the next month. Well, month and a half. It's a case of the Supreme Court of the United States in which the affirmative action program at Harvard and the affirmative action program at the University of North Carolina are being challenged.

And what they say is, we need affirmative action because affirmative action is good for pedagogical reasons. Now, frankly, do I think there's something to that? I think there's a little something to that with respect to some subjects. I don't think that's what's really going on for the most part. I mean, if that's what's really going on, why don't we have more foreign students? Why isn't there a greater effort to bring in more foreign students? Why isn't there a greater effort to bring in more, I don't know, religious fundamentalists? Why isn't there a greater effort to bring in? And you could just name various groups that are you hardly ever see them on campus. - So you don't think this kind of effort of driving towards diversity is rigorous enough? - I think it's often pretextual. I think frankly the real reason has to do with the belief. And I think it's a good belief. I associate myself with the belief it's just that because of the legal rules, the authorities can't say this belief out loud, but it's still the case that a lot of institutions want to help American society overcome its racial past.

Like I think we're still human and we see people that look like us. And this kind of narrow shallow definition of diversity still matters. - Okay, well, I think you've made a good point. And maybe so, so let's go back to the physics. I mean, let's suppose that under one scenario there's a classroom and a kid sticks his head, a Black kid sticks his head in the classroom and doesn't see anybody else Black there and has to make a quick decision and says, \"Eh, nah, this ain't for me.\" Versus they stick their head in the classroom, they see a smattering there Black people in the classroom, they say, \"Let me try this.\" And then they try it and it turns out they're Albert Einstein. So, to that extent I can see under that scenario, maybe it does matter. So, I'll have to recalibrate. Still, those are the three leading justifications for affirmative action. You asked me where do I stand with respect to affirmative action? Oh, no, before we get to that, are there criticisms? The answer is yes. There are criticisms of affirmative action. Affirmative action is a policy like, any policy, any policy is gonna have some downsides to it. And affirmative action is no different. Does affirmative action have some downsides? Yes, it does have, have some downsides. So what are they? Well, let me mention a couple. One, stigma, stigma. So if you have an institution that says that it reaches out to give a boost to certain people on a racial basis, they're gonna be people who observe that and who were gonna be thinking to themselves. If so and so is here and they were given a special boost, doesn't that mean that they were not as proficient as the other people who were here and who did not have that boost?

But I'm still in a situation which- - Have to work hard. - Yes to avoid the stigmatization.",

I'll never forget this. It was in my second year of law school. It was in tax class. We had a very famous tax teacher, wonderful tax teacher. On the very first day of class, Professor Becker, wonderful man, wonderful teacher Boris Becker. Called on the very first person he called on was a Black student. I remember this as if it were yesterday called on a Black student and it was a Black woman student. And I remember when he called on her, I remember just, I felt as if the room got quieter. Really, I felt as if the room got quieter. And I know there was a real tenseness within me. He didn't call on me 'cause he was going on somebody else was a Black woman student. And I felt different. I felt as if I was somehow at issue. I felt as if my place, I felt as if my status was some small degree at issue. - In the positive direction of the negative. - Just at issue. - [Jack] At issue? - And so now the, all of this is happening really quickly. He calls on the student, happening like in seconds. And she responded and she responded really strongly. It was clear. He asked her a question. She answered the question, she answered the question, I mean, very strong, comprehensive, wonderful response. Now you might say, \"Okay, well, smart student. Okay, fine, next.\" After class, after class, I went up to her and I clearly remember this. I said, \"That was great, thank you.\" Why? Because I'm a Black student, predominantly White institution, Yale Law School. And I felt some of again, affirmative action, I felt some of the burden of this affirmative action stigma. - So it was almost like a thank you for showing that we belong here. - Yes perfect. Boom. Yes, that's exactly what the situation. And by the way, I wasn't, the only one, I wasn't being idiosyncratic. I wasn't the only one.",

And some people have made a lot of this, some people have really made a lot of the stigma issue my attitude towards a stigma issue. Yeah, it's there, it's, you know, again, it's part of the situation, but I think that the benefits outweigh the burdens. But is that a burden? Yeah, that's a burden. What are some others? Resentment. Resentment in society. And in the fancy schools, and by the way, remember when we're talking about affirmative action, most colleges and universities in the United States, there is no affirmative action issue because they're not selective. Hell, they'll take anybody who if you can pay, come on in. It's only a fairly small set of schools that are selective. But of course, those are the most elite schools. Those are the schools that people most want to get into. And that's one of the reasons why we have all this, fighting over those schools. Now, how many millions of people are there in America who have applied to various places they didn't get in? And what do they say? The White person who applied to Harvard, applied to Yale, applied to Columbia, apply to Georgetown, apply to NYU. You could go didn't get in. What do they say I would've gotten in? It hadn't been for that racial affirmative action. They're resentful. Well, should they be resentful? No, they shouldn't be resentful, but they are resentful. Does that have a consequence? Yeah, it has a consequence. It has a consequence on how they act towards other people. It has a consequence on how they vote. It has a consequence. And that's something. Are there things? Yeah. And in my book, I go through various, I think that there is a certain sort of denialism that has accompanied the affirmative action debate. So because Black people like myself want to avoid the stigmatizing burden of affirmative action, there's some people who to deal with that have said, \"Oh, actually there is no difference",

That's just BS. They're, you know, the only reason the kid who the 550 kid didn't get 750, is because the test asks all sorts of biased culturally biased things like what is a yacht? Well, sorry, yes, there is a difference. There's a 200 point difference. Does the difference matter? Yes, the difference matters. And by the way, if you don't know what a yacht is not, you can know what a yacht is without owning a yacht, okay? And there's this denialism that I think has really seeped into not just into various conversations. - That can have a slippery slope effect that's beyond just this. - Yes. And we see it in various ways. So, this attack on testing, it's not like I'm holding the some tests are not good tests. I think we should be skeptical of everything. But there are a lot of tests that yeah, they tell us something all right. They tell us who knows what. And there's some people who are really, dead set against testing because they're dead set against anything that might show a gap. Well, I think, by the way are there gaps? Yeah, there are gaps. And what we need to do is be cognizant of those gaps and do things to make it so that if there's a gap, if you're deficient, no shame in being deficient. Heck, I'm deficient about a lot of things. Let's learn so that I catch up. But I think sometimes there've been people who've been afraid of even acknowledging the gaps. - Of course, there's, I guess, a colleague of yours, Michael Sandel with, with \"Tyranny of Merit.\" There's interesting, rigorous ways to kind of challenge ways on the flip side of that, where obsessing with merit can go wrong also. - Yes. You mentioned Michael Sandel. He's a wonderful colleague, and he is a wonderful friend. I've known him a long time. I think he makes very important arguments about meritocracy. I disagree with some of the points",

I don't care what your last name is. I don't care what your color of your skin is. Show me what you can do. And then somebody sits down, okay, I'll show you what I can do? And they show it. You're in. I think there's a lot to that. And the impulse to sentiments behind that, I resonate with that. I think that there's a lot there. What I wanna do is I want to get rid of those features in society that deprive people of the what you need to develop yourself. Sometimes those are psychological. Sometimes it's you're not around people who've done things that give you the idea that you can do things. I wanna get rid of that. But the idea by the way of distinguishing, this is excellent. And the people who are excellent, they're here. And then there are people who are good. Are they excellent? No, they're not excellent. They're good. I'm not gonna close my eyes to that distinction. - And highlight that distinction, and yet at the same time maintain a sense that their basic worth as a human being is equal. - Yes. So to was it run DMC? What other rap groups? No, we're all written down on the same list. We're all written down on the same list. Yes, we are. So I wanna recognize our fundamental humanity. I think that one can recognize our fundamental humanity.

Okay, I don't want the winners to be arrogant that's right. Luck has a lot to do with things. You didn't have any control over the circumstances in which you were born into. You were lucky that you were born healthy and that you were born with a well-working mind. You didn't have anything to do with that. That was pure luck. There's some people who don't have that luck. So don't be Mr. Big stuff, okay? So I'm, you know, I'm against that sort of arrogance. I'm entitled as if I taught myself how to read. No, you didn't teach yourself how to read. There was people who did all sorts of things for you, and you don't even know it, okay? So, I wanna get rid of the arrogance, have decent humility I'm all for that.

No, no, no no. I don't want that. I wanna give a trophy to the person who wins the race, because I think it's a good thing to valorize the best. - Yeah. It's a a kind of celebration of this whole human project that we're on. It's celebrating the best. You mentioned your father several times so let me just linger on that.

All three of us know beyond any controversy that we were loved and dearly loved by our parents. And they were great people. My father, very interesting man, very independent minded. He was perfectly willing to go his own way. And I learned much from him, including, I learned things from him, even when I ultimately disagreed with him. So, for instance, again, to go back to his pessimism, yeah, he was pessimistic, thoroughly pessimistic. But he was also willing to change in certain ways. In fact, both my parents, I mean, one of the most important things that happened to my parents was that I'd say when I was, let's say 10 years old, I was born in 1954. So in 1964, in 1964, I think my parents would've taken the position that you definitely never under any circumstances trust a White person. If a Black person trusts a White person, that person is a fool. Do not trust White people all right? They are not to be trusted. And it's the highly unusual one who is not prejudiced, okay? So White people are not to be trusted and by and large are gonna be your enemy, all right? So let's just face that. That's was their point of view. I'd say that I'd say that 10 years later, that point of view had been leavened somewhat, I think. And you say, \"Well, what happened in those 10 years?\" Well, certainly in my life, one of the things that happened in, in those 10 years is, I was a student in various schools and I had a series of teachers. I've had wonderful Black teachers, I've also had wonderful White teachers. And my parents paid attention to who my teachers were and how my teachers treated me. And I think that they were affected by the way in which there were White people who really helped me and were on my side and were thoroughly on my side.

And the school, I mean, again, I said a moment ago how lucky I've been, heck. I teach at Harvard Law School, I attended Bayle College, Oxford, I got my law degree from Yale Law School. I got my undergraduate degree at Princeton University. Those are some pretty good schools. They all were, they all were. The most important school, however, that I attended. The school that made the most difference in my education was my high school. St. Albans School. St. Albans School for Boys. And at St. Albans, I encountered a cadre of teachers. And by the way, St. Alban's, when I went to St. Albans, all these teachers were White. All of these teachers, there was one, the head of athletics, very important man, very impressive man, Brooks Johnson was Black, otherwise White teachers. And these teachers made a huge difference in my life. And I can call their names, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. The greatest of them all was a man by the name of Jack McCune. Yep, we called him Gentleman Jack. Gentleman Jack McCune and- - What subject did he teach? - He taught me history. He was my advanced placement history teacher, but John F. McCune and we shared a birthday. John F. McCune was a fabulously good teacher. And we developed a deep lifetime friendship. I was with Mr. McCune the day before he died. And he was a White man.

Do you still share that dream? - I think that Martin Luther King Jr's, I have a dream speech is one of the great speeches, not only in American history, but in the history of the world. There's a tendency now for people to sort of poo poo that speech. I think unfortunately the speech, has been embraced by advertisers and corporate America. It's been heard so many times that it's sort of, has been made to suffer from what some people might view as over exposure. - It's so unfortunate. I mean- - [Randal] It's too bad. - When especially when Hollywood rolls in. They did that with John Lennon's, \"Imagine.\" Recently, which I think is one of the greatest songs ever. And the Hectors and actresses ruined it by trying to like, sing along and do this kind of cliche Hollywood thing. - It has, but people have tried to make it into a cliche. The fact of the matter is, it's the sentiment. The sentiment behind, I have a dream. Yeah, I'll associate myself with that. And anybody wants to see some great oratory go watch. And, Martin Luther King Jr, I mean, he gave several great speeches. His first speech, the first speech that he gave as a civil rights leader, the Holt Street Baptist Church, 1955, at the beginning of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which was virtually an extemporaneous speech, was one of his greatest. And he was, I think 26 years old. Great. His last speech, his mountaintop speech. Great speech.",
