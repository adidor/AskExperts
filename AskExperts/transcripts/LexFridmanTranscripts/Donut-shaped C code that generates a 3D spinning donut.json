        "text": "here on the left is a spinning ASCII donut and on the right is a donut shaped C code by Andy Sloan that generates it now with syntax highlighting now I recommend you check out Andy's blog post on the mathematics behind a flying spinning Taurus AKA donut the link to the post is in the description the basic steps are create a circle then create a Taurus by rotating the circle about the y-axis then using rotation matrices spin a donut around the x and z axes finally project the donut onto the 2D screen adding illumination by calculating the surface normal after picking a particular light source the cool thing is because this is ASCII world there's different characters associated with different levels of luminance we can go back to the de-africated version of the code that I generated adding a microsecond sleeve function to Aid in the animation compiling and running the code we get our spinning donut there's a lot of parameters that you can control with this donut including the field of view and the distance of the donor from the viewer I spend at least an hour every day learning and exploring outside my main line of work so I thought it'd be cool to uh start throwing together quick little videos about things that I find beautiful whether they're basic or advanced in the world of machine learning math computer science programming psychology whatever even biology physics history and philosophy so hope this is uh a value fun and something you would enjoy",
